<p>The potent new antiviral inhibitor TMC-114 (UIC-94017) of HIV-1 protease (PR) has been studied with three PR variants containing single mutations D30N, I50V, and L90M, which provide resistance to the major clinical inhibitors. The inhibition constants (K(i)) of TMC-114 for mutants PR(D30N), PR(I50V), and PR(L90M) were 30-, 9-, and 0.14-fold, respectively, relative to wild-type PR. The molecular basis for the inhibition was analyzed using high-resolution (1.22-1.45 A) crystal structures of PR mutant complexes with TMC-114. In PR(D30N), the inhibitor has a water-mediated interaction with the side chain of Asn30 rather than the direct interaction observed in PR, which is consistent with the relative inhibition. Similarly, in PR(I50V) the inhibitor loses favorable hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of Val50. TMC-114 has additional van der Waals contacts in PR(L90M) structure compared to the PR structure, leading to a tighter binding of the inhibitor. The observed changes in PR structure and activity are discussed in relation to the potential for development of resistant mutants on exposure to TMC-114.</p>

<p>During turnover, the catalytic tyrosine residue (Tyr10) of the sigma class Schistosoma haematobium wild-type glutathione-S-transferase is expected to switch alternately in and out of the reduced glutathione-binding site (G-site). The Tyrout10 conformer forms a pi-cation interaction with the guanidinium group of Arg21. As in other similar glutathione-S-transferases, the catalytic Tyr has a low pKa of 7.2. In order to investigate the catalytic role of Tyr10, and the structural and functional roles of Arg21, we carried out structural studies on two Arg21 mutants (R21L and R21Q) and a Tyr10 mutant, Y10F. Our crystallographic data for the two Arg21 mutants indicate that only the Tyrout10 conformation is populated, thereby excluding a role of Arg21 in the stabilisation of the out conformation. However, Arg21 was confirmed to be catalytically important and essential for the low pKa of Tyr10. Upon comparison with structural data generated for reduced glutathione-bound and inhibitor-bound wild-type enzymes, it was observed that the orientations of Tyr10 and Arg35 are concerted and that, upon ligand binding, minor rearrangements occur within conserved residues in the active site loop. These rearrangements are coupled to quaternary rigid-body movements at the dimer interface and alterations in the localisation and structural order of the C-terminal domain.</p>

<p>The pim-1 kinase is a true oncogene that has been implicated in the development of leukemias, lymphomas, and prostate cancer, and is the target of drug development programs. We have used experimental approaches to identify a selective, cell-permeable, small-molecule inhibitor of the pim-1 kinase to foster basic and translational studies of the enzyme. We used an ELISA-based kinase assay to screen a diversity library of potential kinase inhibitors. The flavonol quercetagetin (3,3',4',5,6,7-hydroxyflavone) was identified as a moderately potent, ATP-competitive inhibitor (IC(50), 0.34 micromol/L). Resolution of the crystal structure of PIM1 in complex with quercetagetin or two other flavonoids revealed a spectrum of binding poses and hydrogen-bonding patterns in spite of strong similarity of the ligands. Quercetagetin was a highly selective inhibitor of PIM1 compared with PIM2 and seven other serine-threonine kinases. Quercetagetin was able to inhibit PIM1 activity in intact RWPE2 prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (ED(50), 5.5 micromol/L). RWPE2 cells treated with quercetagetin showed pronounced growth inhibition at inhibitor concentrations that blocked PIM1 kinase activity. Furthermore, the ability of quercetagetin to inhibit the growth of other prostate epithelial cell lines varied in proportion to their levels of PIM1 protein. Quercetagetin can function as a moderately potent and selective, cell-permeable inhibitor of the pim-1 kinase, and may be useful for proof-of-concept studies to support the development of clinically useful PIM1 inhibitors.</p>

<p>An extensive structural manifold of short hydrogen bond-mediated, active site-directed, serine protease inhibition motifs is revealed in a set of over 300 crystal structures involving a large suite of small molecule inhibitors (2-(2-phenol)-indoles and 2-(2-phenol)-benzimidazoles) determined over a wide range of pH (3.5-11.4). The active site hydrogen-bonding mode was found to vary markedly with pH, with the steric and electronic properties of the inhibitor, and with the type of protease (trypsin, thrombin or urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA)). The pH dependence of the active site hydrogen-bonding motif is often intricate, constituting a distinct fingerprint of each complex. Isosteric replacements or minor substitutions within the inhibitor that modulate the pK(a) of the phenol hydroxyl involved in short hydrogen bonding, or that affect steric interactions distal to the active site, can significantly shift the pH-dependent structural profile characteristic of the parent scaffold, or produce active site-binding motifs unique to the bound analog. Ionization equilibria at the active site associated with inhibitor binding are probed in a series of the protease-inhibitor complexes through analysis of the pH dependence of the structure and environment of the active site-binding groups involved in short hydrogen bond arrays. Structures determined at high pH (&gt;11), suggest that the pK(a) of His57 is dramatically elevated, to a value as high as approximately 11 in certain complexes. K(i) values involving uPA and trypsin determined as a function of pH for a set of inhibitors show pronounced parabolic pH dependence, the pH for optimal inhibition governed by the pK(a) of the inhibitor phenol involved in short hydrogen bonds. Comparison of structures of trypsin, thrombin and uPA, each bound by the same inhibitor, highlights important structural variations in the S1 and active sites accessible for engineering notable selectivity into remarkably small molecules with low nanomolar K(i) values.</p>

<p>Nonspecific, extracellular nucleases have received enhanced attention recently as a consequence of the critical role that these enzymes can play in infectivity by overcoming the host neutrophil defense system. The activity of the cyanobacterial nuclease NucA, a member of the betabetaalpha Me superfamily, is controlled by the specific nuclease inhibitor, NuiA. Here we report the 2.3-A resolution crystal structure of the NucA-NuiA complex, showing that NucA inhibition by NuiA involves an unusual divalent metal ion bridge that connects the nuclease with its inhibitor. The C-terminal Thr-135(NuiA) hydroxyl oxygen is directly coordinated with the catalytic Mg(2+) of the nuclease active site, and Glu-24(NuiA) also extends into the active site, mimicking the charge of a scissile phosphate. NuiA residues Asp-75 and Trp-76 form a second interaction site, contributing to the strength and specificity of the interaction. The crystallographically defined interface is shown to be consistent with results of studies using site-directed NuiA mutants. This mode of inhibition differs dramatically from the exosite mechanism of inhibition seen with the DNase colicins E7/E9 and from other nuclease-inhibitor complexes that have been studied. The structure of this complex provides valuable insights for the development of inhibitors for related nonspecific nucleases that share the DRGH active site motif such as the Streptococcus pneumoniae nuclease EndA, which mediates infectivity of this pathogen, and mitochondrial EndoG, which is involved in recombination and apoptosis.</p>

<p>Isoquinolinesulfonamides inhibit human carbonic anhydrases (hCAs) and display selectivity toward therapeutically relevant isozymes. The crystal structure of hCA II in complex with 6,7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-ylsulfonamide revealed unusual inhibitor binding. Structural analyses allowed for discerning the fine details of the inhibitor binding mode to the active site, thus providing clues for the future design of even more selective inhibitors for druggable isoforms such as the cancer associated hCA IX and neuronal hCA VII.</p>

<p>Initially identified in yeast, the exosome has emerged as a central component of the RNA maturation and degradation machinery both in Archaea and eukaryotes. Here we describe a series of high-resolution structures of the RNase PH ring from the Pyrococcus abyssi exosome, one of them containing three 10-mer RNA strands within the exosome catalytic chamber, and report additional nucleotide interactions involving positions N5 and N7. Residues from all three Rrp41-Rrp42 heterodimers interact with a single RNA molecule, providing evidence for the functional relevance of exosome ring-like assembly in RNA processivity. Furthermore, an ADP-bound structure showed a rearrangement of nucleotide interactions at site N1, suggesting a rationale for the elimination of nucleoside diphosphate after catalysis. In combination with RNA degradation assays performed with mutants of key amino acid residues, the structural data presented here provide support for a model of exosome-mediated RNA degradation that integrates the events involving catalytic cleavage, product elimination, and RNA translocation. Finally, comparisons between the archaeal and human exosome structures provide a possible explanation for the eukaryotic exosome inability to catalyze phosphate-dependent RNA degradation.</p>

<p>We present the 1.2 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of a Ni-methyl species that is a proposed catalytic intermediate in methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), the enzyme that catalyzes the biological formation of methane. The methyl group is situated 2.1 Å proximal of the Ni atom of the MCR coenzyme F(430). A rearrangement of the substrate channel has been posited to bring together substrate species, but Ni(III)-methyl formation alone does not lead to any observable structural changes in the channel.</p>

<p>Complement activation contributes directly to health and disease. It neutralizes pathogens and stimulates immune processes. Defects lead to immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases, whereas inappropriate activation causes self-damage. In the lectin and classical pathways, complement is triggered upon recognition of a pathogen by an activating complex. Here we present the first structure of such a complex in the form of the collagen-like domain of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and the binding domain of its associated protease (MASP-1/-3). The collagen binds within a groove using a pivotal lysine side chain that interacts with Ca(2+)-coordinating residues, revealing the essential role of Ca(2+). This mode of binding is prototypic for all activating complexes of the lectin and classical pathways, and suggests a general mechanism for the global changes that drive activation. The structural insights reveal a new focus for inhibitors and we have validated this concept by targeting the binding pocket of the MASP.</p>

<p>Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of guanine in the wobble position of particular tRNAs by the modified base preQ(1). In vitro, however, the enzyme is also able to insert the immediate biosynthetic precursor, preQ(0), into those tRNAs. This substrate promiscuity is based on a peptide switch in the active site, gated by the general acid/base Glu235. The switch alters the properties of the binding pocket to allow either the accommodation of guanine or preQ(1). The peptide conformer recognising guanine, however, is also able to bind preQ(0). To investigate selectivity regulation, kinetic data for Zymomonas mobilis Tgt were recorded. They show that selectivity in favour of the actual substrate preQ(1) over preQ(0) is not achieved by a difference in affinity but via a higher turnover rate. Moreover, a Tgt(Glu235Gln) variant was constructed. The mutation was intended to stabilise the peptide switch in the conformation favouring guanine and preQ(0) binding. Kinetic characterisation of the mutated enzyme revealed that the Glu235Gln exchange has, with respect to all substrate bases, no significant influence on k(cat). In contrast, K(M)(preQ(1)) is drastically increased, while K(M)(preQ(0)) seems to be decreased. Hence, regarding k(cat)/K(M) as an indicator for catalytic efficiency, selectivity of Tgt in favour of preQ(1) is abolished or even inverted in favour of preQ(0) for Tgt(Glu235Gln). Crystal structures of the mutated enzyme confirm that the mutation strongly favours the binding pocket conformation required for the accommodation of guanine and preQ(0). The way this is achieved, however, significantly differs from that predicted based on crystal structures of wild-type Tgt.</p>

<p>Bisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial compound and a well known endocrine-disrupting chemical with estrogenic activity. The widespread exposure of individuals to BPA is suspected to affect a variety of physiological functions, including reproduction, development, and metabolism. Here we report that the mechanisms by which BPA and two congeners, bisphenol AF and bisphenol C (BPC), bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ER) α and β differ from that used by 17β-estradiol. We show that bisphenols act as partial agonists of ERs by activating the N-terminal activation function 1 regardless of their effect on the C-terminal activation function 2, which ranges from weak agonism (with BPA) to antagonism (with BPC). Crystallographic analysis of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs reveals two discrete binding modes, reflecting the different activities of compounds on ERs. BPA and 17β-estradiol bind to ERs in a similar fashion, whereas, with a phenol ring pointing toward the activation helix H12, the orientation of BPC accounts for the marked antagonist character of this compound. Based on structural data, we developed a protocol for in silico evaluation of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs or other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, such as estrogen-related receptor γ and androgen receptor, which are two known main targets of bisphenols. Overall, this study provides a wealth of tools and information that could be used for the development of BPA substitutes devoid of nuclear hormone receptor-mediated activity and more generally for environmental risk assessment.</p>

<p>Anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (AnPRT, EC 2.4.2.18) is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reaction between 5'-phosphoribosyl 1'-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and anthranilate, as part of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. Here we present the results of the first chemical screen for inhibitors against Mycobacterium tuberculosis AnPRT (Mtb-AnPRT), along with crystal structures of Mtb-AnPRT in complex with PRPP and several inhibitors. Previous work revealed that PRPP is bound at the base of a deep cleft in Mtb-AnPRT and predicted two anthranilate binding sites along the tunnel leading to the PRPP binding site. Unexpectedly, the inhibitors presented here almost exclusively bound at the entrance of the tunnel, in the presumed noncatalytic anthranilate binding site, previously hypothesized to have a role in substrate capture. The potencies of the inhibitors were measured, yielding Ki values of 1.5-119 μM, with the strongest inhibition displayed by a bianthranilate compound that makes hydrogen bond and salt bridge contacts with Mtb-AnPRT via its carboxyl groups. Our results reveal how the substrate capture mechanism of AnPRT can be exploited to inhibit the enzyme's activity and provide a scaffold for the design of improved Mtb-AnPRT inhibitors that may ultimately form the basis of new antituberculosis drugs with a novel mode of action. </p>

<p>Octahaem cytochrome c nitrite reductase from Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens (TvNiR), like the previously characterized pentahaem nitrite reductases (NrfAs), catalyzes the six-electron reductions of nitrite to ammonia and of sulfite to sulfide. The active site of both TvNiR and NrfAs is formed by the lysine-coordinated haem and His, Tyr and Arg residues. The distinguishing structural feature of TvNiR is the presence of a covalent bond between the CE2 atom of the catalytic Tyr303 and the S atom of Cys305, which might be responsible for the higher nitrite reductase activity of TvNiR compared with NrfAs. In the present study, a new modified form of the enzyme (TvNiRb) that contains an additional covalent bond between Tyr303 CE1 and Gln360 CG is reported. Structures of TvNiRb in complexes with phosphate (1.45 Å resolution) and sulfite (1.8 Å resolution), the structure of TvNiR in a complex with nitrite (1.83 Å resolution) and several additional structures were determined. The formation of the second covalent bond by Tyr303 leads to a decrease in both the nitrite and sulfite reductase activities of the enzyme. Tyr303 is located at the exit from the putative proton-transport channel to the active site, which is absent in NrfAs. This is an additional argument in favour of the involvement of Tyr303 as a proton donor in catalysis. The changes in the activity of cytochrome c nitrite reductases owing to the formation of Tyr-Cys and Tyr-Gln bonds may be associated with changes in the pK(a) value of the catalytic tyrosine.</p>

<p>Cooperativity among ligand binding, subunit association, and protein folding has implications for enzyme regulation as well as protein aggregation events associated with disease. The binding of substrate l-arginine or cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin converts nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) from a "loose dimer", with an exposed active center and higher sensitivity to proteolysis, to a "tight dimer" competent for catalysis. The crystallographic structure of the Bacillus subtilis NOS loose dimer shows an altered association state with severely destabilized subdomains. Ligand binding or heme reduction converts loose dimers to tight dimers in solution and crystals. Mutations at key positions in the dimer interface that distinguish prokaryotic from eukaryotic NOSs affect the propensity to form loose dimers. The loose dimer structure indicates that non-native interactions can mediate subunit association in NOS.</p>

<p>Site-directed spin labeling provides a means for exploring structure and dynamics in proteins. To interpret the complex EPR spectra that often arise, it is necessary to characterize the rotamers of the spin-labeled side chain and the interactions they make with the local environment in proteins of known structure. For this purpose, crystal structures have been determined for T4 lysozyme bearing a nitroxide side chain (R1) at the solvent-exposed helical sites 41 and 44 in the B helix. These sites are of particular interest in that the corresponding EPR spectra reveal two dynamic states of R1, one of which is relatively immobilized suggesting interactions of the nitroxide with the environment. The crystal structures together with the effect of mutagenesis of nearest neighbors on the motion of R1 suggest intrahelical interactions of 41R1 with the i + 4 residue and of 44R1 with the i + 1 residue. Such interactions appear to be specific to particular rotamers of the R1 side chain.</p>

<p>We have solved a crystal structure from Melanocarpus albomyces laccase expressed in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei (rMaL) at 1.3A resolution by using synchrotron radiation at 100K. At the moment, this is the highest resolution that has been attained for any multicopper oxidase. The present structure confirmed our earlier proposal regarding the dynamic behaviour of the copper cluster. Thermal ellipsoids of copper atoms indicated movements of trinuclear site coppers. The direction of the type-3 copper motion was perpendicular to the type-2 copper. In addition, the structure at 1.3A resolution allowed us to describe important solvent cavities of the enzyme and the structure is also compared with other known multicopper oxidases. T2 and T3 solvent cavities, and a putative SDS-gate, formed by Ser142, Ser510 and the C-terminal Asp556 of rMaL, are described. We also observed a 2-oxohistidine, an oxidized histidine, possibly caused by a metal-catalysed oxidation by the trinuclear site coppers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that 2-oxohistidine has been observed in a protein crystal structure.</p>

<p>SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV M(pro)) is essential for the replication of the virus and regarded as a major antiviral drug target. The enzyme is a cysteine protease, with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145/His-41) in the active site. Aldehyde inhibitors can bind reversibly to the active-site sulfhydryl of SARS-CoV M(pro). Previous studies using peptidic substrates and inhibitors showed that the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV M(pro) requires glutamine in the P1 position and a large hydrophobic residue in the P2 position. We determined four crystal structures of SARS-CoV M(pro) in complex with pentapeptide aldehydes (Ac-ESTLQ-H, Ac-NSFSQ-H, Ac-DSFDQ-H, and Ac-NSTSQ-H). Kinetic data showed that all of these aldehydes exhibit inhibitory activity towards SARS-CoV M(pro), with K(i) values in the μM range. Surprisingly, the X-ray structures revealed that the hydrophobic S2 pocket of the enzyme can accommodate serine and even aspartic-acid side-chains in the P2 positions of the inhibitors. Consequently, we reassessed the substrate specificity of the enzyme by testing the cleavage of 20 different tetradecapeptide substrates with varying amino-acid residues in the P2 position. The cleavage efficiency for the substrate with serine in the P2 position was 160-times lower than that for the original substrate (P2=Leu); furthermore, the substrate with aspartic acid in the P2 position was not cleaved at all. We also determined a crystal structure of SARS-CoV M(pro) in complex with aldehyde Cm-FF-H, which has its P1-phenylalanine residue bound to the relatively hydrophilic S1 pocket of the enzyme and yet exhibits a high inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M(pro), with K(i)=2.24±0.58 μM. These results show that the stringent substrate specificity of the SARS-CoV M(pro) with respect to the P1 and P2 positions can be overruled by the highly electrophilic character of the aldehyde warhead, thereby constituting a deviation from the dogma that peptidic inhibitors need to correspond to the observed cleavage specificity of the target protease.</p>

<p>Type I plant nucleases play an important role in apoptotic processes and cell senescence. Recently, they have also been indicated to be potent anticancer agents in in vivo studies. The first structure of tomato nuclease I (TBN1) has been determined, its oligomerization and activity profiles have been analyzed and its unexpected activity towards phospholipids has been discovered, and conclusions are drawn regarding its catalytic mechanism. The structure-solution process required X-ray diffraction data from two crystal forms. The first form was used for phase determination; the second form was used for model building and refinement. TBN1 is mainly α-helical and is stabilized by four disulfide bridges. Three observed oligosaccharides are crucial for its stability and solubility. The active site is localized at the bottom of the positively charged groove and contains a zinc cluster that is essential for enzymatic activity. An equilibrium between monomers, dimers and higher oligomers of TBN1 was observed in solution. Principles of the reaction mechanism of the phosphodiesterase activity are suggested, with central roles for the zinc cluster, the nucleobase-binding pocket (Phe-site) and Asp70, Arg73 and Asn167. Based on the distribution of surface residues, possible binding sites for dsDNA and other nucleic acids with secondary structure were identified. The phospholipase activity of TBN1, which is reported for the first time for a nuclease, significantly broadens the substrate promiscuity of the enzyme, and the resulting release of diacylglycerol, which is an important second messenger, can be related to the role of TBN1 in apoptosis.</p>

<p>Formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) amidotransferase (FGAR-AT) takes part in purine biosynthesis and is a multidomain enzyme with multiple spatially separated active sites. FGAR-AT contains a glutaminase domain that is responsible for the generation of ammonia from glutamine. Ammonia is then transferred via a channel to a second active site located in the synthetase domain and utilized to convert FGAR to formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM) in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dependent reaction. In some ammonia-channelling enzymes ligand binding triggers interdomain signalling between the two diverse active centres and also assists in formation of the ammonia channel. Previously, the structure of FGAR-AT from Salmonella typhimurium containing a glutamyl thioester intermediate covalently bound in the glutaminase active site was determined. In this work, the roles played by various ligands of FGAR-AT in inducing catalytic coupling are investigated. Structures of FGAR-AT from S. typhimurium were determined in two different states: the unliganded form and the binary complex with an ATP analogue in the presence of the glutamyl thioester intermediate. The structures were compared in order to decipher the roles of these two states in interdomain communication. Using a process of elimination, the results indicated that binding of FGAR is most likely to be the major mechanism by which catalytic coupling occurs. This is because conformational changes do not occur either upon formation of the glutamyl thioester intermediate or upon subsequent ATP complexation. A model of the FGAR-bound form of the enzyme suggested that the loop in the synthetase domain may be responsible for initiating catalytic coupling via its interaction with the N-terminal domain.</p>

<p>RNA virus replication is an error-prone event caused by the low fidelity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Replication fidelity can be decreased further by the use of mutagenic ribonucleoside analogs to a point where viral genetic information can no longer be maintained. For foot-and-mouth disease virus, the antiviral analogs ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil have been shown to be mutagenic, contributing to virus extinction through lethal mutagenesis. Here, we report the x-ray structure of four elongation complexes of foot-and-mouth disease virus polymerase 3D obtained in presence of natural substrates, ATP and UTP, or mutagenic nucleotides, ribavirin triphosphate and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate with different RNAs as template-primer molecules. The ability of these complexes to synthesize RNA in crystals allowed us to capture different successive replication events and to define the critical amino acids involved in (i) the recognition and positioning of the incoming nucleotide or analog; (ii) the positioning of the acceptor base of the template strand; and (iii) the positioning of the 3'-OH group of the primer nucleotide during RNA replication. The structures identify key interactions involved in viral RNA replication and provide insights into the molecular basis of the low fidelity of viral RNA polymerases.</p>

<p>Synthetic cavitands and protein cavities have been widely studied as models for ligand recognition. Here we investigate the Met102 → His substitution in the artificial L99A cavity in T4 lysozyme as a Kemp eliminase. The resulting enzyme had k(cat)/K(M) = 0.43 M(-1) s(-1) and a (k(cat)/K(M))/k(uncat) = 10(7) at pH 5.0. The crystal structure of this enzyme was determined at 1.30 Å, as were the structures of four complexes of substrate and product analogs. The absence of ordered waters or hydrogen bonding interactions, and the presence of a common catalytic base (His102) in an otherwise hydrophobic, buried cavity, facilitated detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism and its optimization. Subsequent substitutions increased eliminase activity by an additional four-fold. As activity-enhancing substitutions were engineered into the cavity, protein stability decreased, consistent with the stability-function trade-off hypothesis. This and related model cavities may provide templates for studying protein design principles in radically simplified environments.</p>

<p>Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS; EC 2.2.1.6) is the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids. It catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of pyruvate into 2-acetolactate or one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of 2-ketobutyrate into 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate. AHAS requires the cofactors thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), Mg(2+) and FAD for activity. The herbicides that target this enzyme are effective in protecting a broad range of crops from weed species. However, resistance in the field is now a serious problem worldwide. To address this, two new sulfonylureas, monosulfuron and monosulfuron ester, have been developed as commercial herbicides in China. These molecules differ from the traditional sulfonylureas in that the heterocyclic ring attached to the nitrogen atom of the sulfonylurea bridge is monosubstituted rather than disubstituted. The structures of these compounds in complex with the catalytic subunit of Arabidopsis thaliana AHAS have been determined to 3.0 and 2.8 A, respectively. In both complexes, these molecules are bound in the tunnel leading to the active site, such that the sole substituent of the heterocyclic ring is buried deepest and oriented towards the ThDP. Unlike the structures of Arabidopsis thaliana AHAS in complex with the classic disubstituted sulfonylureas, where ThDP is broken, this cofactor is intact and present most likely as the hydroxylethyl intermediate.</p>

<p>Using C6-NBD-glucosylceramide (GlcCer) as a substrate, we detected the activity of a conduritol B epoxide-insensitive neutral glycosylceramidase in cytosolic fractions of zebrafish embryos, mouse and rat brains, and human fibroblasts. The candidates for the enzyme were assigned to the Klotho (KL), whose family members share a beta-glucosidase-like domain but whose natural substrates are unknown. Among this family, only the KL-related protein (KLrP) is capable of degrading C6-NBD-GlcCer when expressed in CHOP cells, in which Myc-tagged KLrP was exclusively distributed in the cytosol. In addition, knockdown of the endogenous KLrP by small interfering RNA increased the cellular level of GlcCer. The purified recombinant KLrP hydrolyzed 4-methylumbelliferyl-glucose, C6-NBD-GlcCer, and authentic GlcCer at pH 6.0. The enzyme also hydrolyzed the corresponding galactosyl derivatives, but each k(cat)/Km was much lower than that for glucosyl derivatives. The x-ray structure of KLrP at 1.6A resolution revealed that KLrP is a (beta/alpha)8 TIM barrel, in which Glu(165) and Glu(373) at the carboxyl termini of beta-strands 4 and 7 could function as an acid/base catalyst and nucleophile, respectively. The substrate-binding cleft of the enzyme was occupied with palmitic acid and oleic acid when the recombinant protein was crystallized in a complex with glucose. GlcCer was found to fit well the cleft of the crystal structure of KLrP. Collectively, KLrP was identified as a cytosolic neutral glycosylceramidase that could be involved in a novel nonlysosomal catabolic pathway of GlcCer.</p>

<p>Homo sapiens kynureninase is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of 3-hydroxykynurenine to yield 3-hydroxyanthranilate and L-alanine as part of the tryptophan catabolic pathway leading to the de novo biosynthesis of NAD(+). This pathway results in quinolinate, an excitotoxin that is an NMDA receptor agonist. High levels of quinolinate have been correlated with the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as AIDS-related dementia and Alzheimer's disease. We have synthesized a novel kynureninase inhibitor, 3-hydroxyhippurate, cocrystallized it with human kynureninase, and solved the atomic structure. On the basis of an analysis of the complex, we designed a series of His-102, Ser-332, and Asn-333 mutants. The H102W/N333T and H102W/S332G/N333T mutants showed complete reversal of substrate specificity between 3-hydroxykynurenine and L-kynurenine, thus defining the primary residues contributing to substrate specificity in kynureninases.</p>

<p>L-xylulose reductase (XR) is involved in water re-absorption and cellular osmoregulation. The crystal structure of human XR complemented with site-directed mutagenesis (Cys138Ala) indicated that the disulfide bond in the active site between Cys138 and Cys150 is unstable and may affect the reactivity of the enzyme. The effects of reducing agents on the activities of the wild-type and mutant enzymes indicated the reversibility of disulfide-bond formation, which resulted in three-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, the addition of cysteine (&gt;2 mM) inactivated human XR and was accompanied by a 10-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency. TOF-MS analysis of the inactivated enzyme showed the S-cysteinylation of Cys138 in the wild-type and Cys150 in the mutant enzymes. Thus, the action of human XR may be regulated by cellular redox conditions through reversible disulfide-bond formation and by S-cysteinylation.</p>

<p>Vitamin B₁ is an essential compound in all organisms acting as a cofactor in key metabolic reactions. It is formed by the condensation of two independently biosynthesized molecules referred to as the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties. In bacteria and plants, the biosynthesis of the pyrimidine moiety, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P), requires a single enzyme, THIC (HMP-P synthase). The enzyme uses an iron-sulfur cluster as well as a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical as cofactors to rearrange the 5-amino-imidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) substrate to the pyrimidine ring. So far, the only structure reported is the one from the bacteria Caulobacter crescentus. In an attempt to structurally characterize an eukaryotic HMP-P synthase, we have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of THIC from Arabidopsis thaliana at 1.6 Å. The structure is highly similar to its bacterial counterpart although several loop regions show significant differences with potential implications for the enzymatic properties. Furthermore, we have found a metal ion with octahedral coordination at the same location as a zinc ion in the bacterial enzyme. Our high-resolution atomic model shows a metal ion with multiple coordinated water molecules in the close vicinity of the substrate binding sites and is an important step toward the full characterization of the chemical rearrangement occurring during HMP-P biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Although they represent attractive therapeutic targets, caspases have so far proven recalcitrant to the development of drugs targeting the active site. Allosteric modulation of caspase activity is an alternate strategy that potentially avoids the need for anionic and electrophilic functionality present in most active-site inhibitors. Caspase-6 has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease, including Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Herein we describe a fragment-based lead discovery effort focused on caspase-6 in its active and zymogen forms. Fragments were identified for procaspase-6 using surface plasmon resonance methods and subsequently shown by X-ray crystallography to bind a putative allosteric site at the dimer interface. A fragment-merging strategy was employed to produce nanomolar-affinity ligands that contact residues in the L2 loop at the dimer interface, significantly stabilizing procaspase-6. Because rearrangement of the L2 loop is required for caspase-6 activation, our results suggest a strategy for the allosteric control of caspase activation with drug-like small molecules. </p>

<p>Scytalidium thermophilum produces a catalase with phenol oxidase activity (CATPO) that catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water and also oxidizes various phenolic compounds. A codon-optimized catpo gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The crystal structures of native and recombinant S. thermophilum CATPO and two variants, H82N and V123F, were determined at resolutions of 2.7, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.9 Å, respectively. The structure of CATPO reveals a homotetramer with 698 residues per subunit and with strong structural similarity to Penicillium vitale catalase. The haem component is cis-hydroxychlorin γ-spirolactone, which is rotated 180° with respect to small-subunit catalases. The haem-binding pocket contains two highly conserved water molecules on the distal side. The H82N mutation resulted in conversion of the native d-type haem to a b-type haem. Kinetic studies of the H82N and V123F mutants indicate that both activities are likely to be associated with the haem centre and suggest that the secondary oxidase activity may be a general feature of catalases in the absence of hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<p>The biosynthesis of many vitamins and coenzymes has often proven difficult to elucidate owing to a combination of low abundance and kinetic lability of the pathway intermediates. Through a serial reconstruction of the cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) pathway in Escherichia coli and by His tagging the terminal enzyme in the reaction sequence, we have observed that many unstable intermediates can be isolated as tightly bound enzyme-product complexes. Together, these approaches have been used to extract intermediates between precorrin-4 and hydrogenobyrinic acid in their free acid form and permitted the delineation of the overall reaction catalyzed by CobL, including the formal elucidation of precorrin-7 as a metabolite. Furthermore, a substrate-carrier protein, CobE, that can also be used to stabilize some of the transient metabolic intermediates and enhance their onward transformation, has been identified. The tight association of pathway intermediates with enzymes provides evidence for a form of metabolite channeling.</p>

<p>The structure of the Gla-domainless form of the human anticoagulant enzyme activated protein C has been solved at 2.8 A resolution. The light chain is composed of two domains: an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain modified by a large insert containing an additional disulfide, followed by a typical EGF-like domain. The arrangement of the long axis of these domains describes an angle of approximately 80 degrees. Disulfide linked to the light chain is the catalytic domain, which is generally trypsin-like but contains a large insertion loop at the edge of the active site, a third helical segment, a prominent cationic patch analogous to the anion binding exosite I of thrombin and a trypsin-like Ca[II] binding site. The arrangement of loops around the active site partially restricts access to the cleft. The S2 and S4 subsites are much more polar than in factor Xa and thrombin, and the S2 site is unrestricted. While quite open and exposed, the active site contains a prominent groove, the surface of which is very polar with evidence for binding sites on the primed side, in addition to those typical of the trypsin class found on the non-primed side.</p>

<p>Here, we describe high-resolution X-ray structures of Escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase (E-PPase) complexed with the substrate, magnesium, or manganese pyrophosphate. The structures correspond to steps in the catalytic synthesis of enzyme-bound pyrophosphate (PP(i)) in the presence of fluoride as an inhibitor of hydrolysis. The catalytic reaction intermediates were trapped applying a new method that we developed for initiating hydrolytic activity in the E-PPase crystal. X-ray structures were obtained for three consecutive states of the enzyme in the course of hydrolysis. Comparative analysis of these structures showed that the Mn2+-supported hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride bond is followed by a fast release of the leaving phosphate from the P1 site. The electrophilic phosphate P2 is trapped in the "down" conformation. Its movement into the "up" position most likely represents the rate-limiting step of Mn2+-supported hydrolysis. We further determined the crystal structure of the Arg43Gln mutant variant of E-PPase complexed with one phosphate and four Mn ions.</p>

<p>3-Oxo-acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabG) plays a key role in the bacterial fatty acid synthesis II system in pathogenic microorganisms, which has been recognized as a potential drug target. FabG catalyzes reduction of a 3-oxo-acyl-ACP intermediate during the elongation cycle of fatty acid biosynthesis. Here, we report gene deletion experiments that support the essentiality of this gene in P. aeruginosa and the identification of a number of small molecule FabG inhibitors with IC50 values in the nanomolar to low micromolar range and good physicochemical properties. Structural characterization of 16 FabG-inhibitor complexes by X-ray crystallography revealed that the compounds bind at a novel allosteric site located at the FabG subunit-subunit interface. Inhibitor binding relies primarily on hydrophobic interactions, but specific hydrogen bonds are also observed. Importantly, the binding cavity is formed upon complex formation and therefore would not be recognized by virtual screening approaches. The structure analysis further reveals that the inhibitors act by inducing conformational changes that propagate to the active site, resulting in a displacement of the catalytic triad and the inability to bind NADPH. </p>

<p>Bacterial UMP kinases are essential enzymes involved in the multistep synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates. They are hexamers regulated by the allosteric activator GTP and inhibited by UTP. We solved the crystal structure of Escherichia coli UMP kinase bound to the UMP substrate (2.3 A resolution), the UDP product (2.6 A), or UTP (2.45 A). The monomer fold, unrelated to that of other nucleoside monophosphate kinases, belongs to the carbamate kinase-like superfamily. However, the phosphate acceptor binding cleft and subunit assembly are characteristic of UMP kinase. Interactions with UMP explain the high specificity for this natural substrate. UTP, previously described as an allosteric inhibitor, was unexpectedly found in the phosphate acceptor site, suggesting that it acts as a competitive inhibitor. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues Thr-138 and Asn-140, involved in both uracil recognition and active site interaction within the hexamer, decreased the activation by GTP and inhibition by UTP. These experiments suggest a cross-talk mechanism between enzyme subunits involved in cooperative binding at the phosphate acceptor site and in allosteric regulation by GTP. As bacterial UMP kinases have no counterpart in eukaryotes, the information provided here could help the design of new antibiotics.</p>

<p>CpGH89 is a large multimodular enzyme produced by the human and animal pathogen Clostridium perfringens. The catalytic activity of this exo-α-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase is directed towards a rare carbohydrate motif, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine-α-1,4-D-galactose, which is displayed on the class III mucins deep within the gastric mucosa. In addition to the family 89 glycoside hydrolase catalytic module this enzyme has six modules that share sequence similarity to the family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM32s), suggesting the enzyme has considerable capacity to adhere to carbohydrates. Here we suggest that two of the modules, CBM32-1 and CBM32-6, are not functional as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and demonstrate that three of the CBMs, CBM32-3, CBM32-4, and CBM32-5, are indeed capable of binding carbohydrates. CBM32-3 and CBM32-4 have a novel binding specificity for N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine-α-1,4-D-galactose, which thus complements the specificity of the catalytic module. The X-ray crystal structure of CBM32-4 in complex with this disaccharide reveals a mode of recognition that is based primarily on accommodation of the unique bent shape of this sugar. In contrast, as revealed by a series of X-ray crystal structures and quantitative binding studies, CBM32-5 displays the structural and functional features of galactose binding that is commonly associated with CBM family 32. The functional CBM32s that CpGH89 contains suggest the possibility for multivalent binding events and the partitioning of this enzyme to highly specific regions within the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<p>To efficiently catalyze a chemical reaction, enzymes are required to maintain fast rates for formation of the Michaelis complex, the chemical reaction and product release. These distinct demands could be satisfied via fluctuation between different conformational substates (CSs) with unique configurations and catalytic properties. However, there is debate as to how these rapid conformational changes, or dynamics, exactly affect catalysis. As a model system, we have studied bacterial phosphotriesterase (PTE), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the pesticide paraoxon at rates limited by a physical barrier-either substrate diffusion or conformational change. The mechanism of paraoxon hydrolysis is understood in detail and is based on a single, dominant, enzyme conformation. However, the other aspects of substrate turnover (substrate binding and product release), although possibly rate-limiting, have received relatively little attention. This work identifies "open" and "closed" CSs in PTE and dominant structural transition in the enzyme that links them. The closed state is optimally preorganized for paraoxon hydrolysis, but seems to block access to/from the active site. In contrast, the open CS enables access to the active site but is poorly organized for hydrolysis. Analysis of the structural and kinetic effects of mutations distant from the active site suggests that remote mutations affect the turnover rate by altering the conformational landscape.</p>

<p>Family 18 chitinases play key roles in a range of pathogenic organisms and are overexpressed in the asthmatic lung. By screening a library of marketed drug molecules, we have identified methylxanthine derivatives as possible inhibitor leads. These derivatives, theophylline, caffeine, and pentoxifylline, are used therapeutically as antiinflammatory agents, with pleiotropic mechanisms of action. Here it is shown that they are also competitive inhibitors against a fungal family 18 chitinase, with pentoxifylline being the most potent (K(i) of 37 microM). Crystallographic analysis of chitinase-inhibitor complexes revealed specific interactions with the active site, mimicking the reaction intermediate analog, allosamidin. Mutagenesis identified the key active site residues, conserved in mammalian chitinases, which contribute to inhibitor affinity. Enzyme assays also revealed that these methylxanthines are active against human chitinases.</p>

<p>Humans have three functioning genes that encode copper-containing amine oxidases. The product of the AOC1 gene is a so-called diamine oxidase (hDAO), named for its substrate preference for diamines, particularly histamine. hDAO has been cloned and expressed in insect cells and the structure of the native enzyme determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.8 A. The homodimeric structure has the archetypal amine oxidase fold. Two active sites, one in each subunit, are characterized by the presence of a copper ion and a topaquinone residue formed by the post-translational modification of a tyrosine. Although hDAO shares 37.9% sequence identity with another human copper amine oxidase, semicarbazide sensitive amine oxidase or vascular adhesion protein-1, its substrate binding pocket and entry channel are distinctly different in accord with the different substrate specificities. The structures of two inhibitor complexes of hDAO, berenil and pentamidine, have been refined to resolutions of 2.1 and 2.2 A, respectively. They bind noncovalently in the active-site channel. The inhibitor binding suggests that an aspartic acid residue, conserved in all diamine oxidases but absent from other amine oxidases, is responsible for the diamine specificity by interacting with the second amino group of preferred diamine substrates.</p>

<p>Ricin A-chain (RTA) and saporin-L1 (SAP) catalyze adenosine depurination of 28S rRNA to inhibit protein synthesis and cause cell death. We present the crystal structures of RTA and SAP in complex with transition state analogue inhibitors. These tight-binding inhibitors mimic the sarcin-ricin recognition loop of 28S rRNA and the dissociative ribocation transition state established for RTA catalysis. RTA and SAP share unique purine-binding geometry with quadruple pi-stacking interactions between adjacent adenine and guanine bases and 2 conserved tyrosines. An arginine at one end of the pi-stack provides cationic polarization and enhanced leaving group ability to the susceptible adenine. Common features of these ribosome-inactivating proteins include adenine leaving group activation, a remarkable lack of ribocation stabilization, and conserved glutamates as general bases for activation of the H(2)O nucleophile. Catalytic forces originate primarily from leaving group activation evident in both RTA and SAP in complex with transition state analogues.</p>

<p>The source of affinity for substrates of human nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinases is particularly important in that its knowledge could be used to design more effective antiviral nucleoside drugs (e.g., AZT). We carried out a microcalorimetric study of the binding of enzymes from two organisms to various nucleotides. Isothermal titration calorimetry has been used to characterize the binding in terms of Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees. Thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of ADP with the hexameric NDP kinase from Dictyostelium discoideum and with the tetrameric enzyme from Myxococcus xanthus, at 20 degrees C, were similar and, in both cases, binding was enthalpy-driven. The interactions of ADP, 2'deoxyADP, GDP, and IDP with the eukaryotic enzyme differed in enthalpic and entropic terms, whereas the Delta G degrees values obtained were similar due to enthalpy--entropy compensation. The binding of the enzyme to nonphysiological nucleotides, such as AMP--PNP, 3'deoxyADP, and 3'-deoxy-3'-amino-ADP, appears to differ in several respects. Crystallography of the protein bound to 3'-deoxy-3'-amino-ADP showed that the drug was in a distorted position, and was unable to interact correctly with active site side chains. The interaction of pyrimidine nucleoside diphosphates with the hexameric enzyme is characterized by a lower affinity than that with purine nucleotides. Titration showed the stoichiometry of the interaction to be abnormal, with 9--12 binding sites/hexamer. The presence of supplementary binding sites might have physiological implications.</p>

<p>AnsA is the cytoplasmic asparaginase from Escherichia coli involved in intracellular asparagine utilization. Analytical ultracentifugation and X-ray crystallography reveal that AnsA forms a tetrameric structure as a dimer of two intimate dimers. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme reveals that AnsA is positively cooperative, displaying a sigmoidal substrate dependence curve with an [S](0.5) of 1 mM L-asparagine and a Hill coefficient (n(H)) of 2.6. Binding of L-asparagine to an allosteric site was observed in the crystal structure concomitant with a reorganization of the quarternary structure, relative to the apo enzyme. The carboxyl group of the bound asparagine makes salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to Arg240, while the N(delta2) nitrogen interacts with Thr162. Mutation of Arg240 to Ala increases the [S](0.5) value to 5.9 mM, presumably by reducing the affinity of the site for L-asparagine, although the enzyme retains cooperativity. Mutation of Thr162 to Ala results in an active enzyme with no cooperativity. Transmission of the signal from the allosteric site to the active site appears to involve subtle interactions at the dimer-dimer interface and relocation of Gln118 into the vicinity of the active site to position the probable catalytic water molecule. These data define the structural basis for the cooperative regulation of the intracellular asparaginase that is required for proper functioning within the cell.</p>

<p>Orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase) is an interesting enzyme with an unusual catalytic activity and a potential drug target in Plasmodium falciparum, which causes malaria. ODCase has been shown to exhibit unusual and interesting interactions with a variety of nucleotide ligands. Cytidine-5'-monophosphate (CMP) is a poor ligand of ODCase, and CMP binds to the active site of ODCase with an unusual orientation and conformation. We designed N3- and N4-modified CMP derivatives as novel ligands to ODCase. These novel CMP derivatives and their corresponding nucleosides were evaluated against Plasmodium falciparum ODCase and parasitic cultures, respectively. These derivatives exhibited improved inhibition of the enzyme catalytic activity, displayed interesting binding conformations and unusual molecular rearrangements of the ligands. These findings with the modified CMP nucleotides underscored the potential of transformation of poor ligands to ODCase into novel inhibitors of this drug target.</p>

<p>The in vitro evolution and engineering of quorum-quenching lactonases with enhanced reactivities was achieved using a thermostable GKL enzyme as a template, yielding the E101G/R230C GKL mutant with increased catalytic activity and a broadened substrate range [Chow, J. Y., Xue, B., Lee, K. H., Tung, A., Wu, L., Robinson, R. C., and Yew, W. S. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 40911-40920]. This enzyme possesses the (β/α)8-barrel fold and is a member of the PLL (phosphotriesterase-like lactonase) group of enzymes within the amidohydrolase superfamily that hydrolyze N-acyl-homoserine lactones, which mediate the quorum-sensing pathways of bacteria. The structure of the evolved N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone (substrate)-bound E101G/R230C GKL enzyme was determined, in the presence of the inactivating D266N mutation, to a resolution of 2.2 Å to provide an explanation for the observed rate enhancements. In addition, the substrate-bound structure of the catalytically inactive E101N/D266N mutant of the manganese-reconstituted enzyme was determined to a resolution of 2.1 Å and the structure of the ligand-free, manganese-reconstituted E101N mutant to a resolution of 2.6 Å, and the structures of ligand-free zinc-reconstituted wild-type, E101N, R230D, and E101G/R230C mutants of GKL were determined to resolutions of 2.1, 2.1, 1.9, and 2.0 Å, respectively. In particular, the structure of the evolved E101G/R230C mutant of GKL provides evidence of a catalytically productive active site architecture that contributes to the observed enhancement of catalysis. At high concentrations, wild-type and mutant GKL enzymes are differentially colored, with absorbance maxima in the range of 512-553 nm. The structures of the wild-type and mutant GKL provide a tractable link between the origins of the coloration and the charge-transfer complex between the α-cation and Tyr99 within the enzyme active site. Taken together, this study provides evidence of the modulability of enzymatic catalysis through subtle changes in enzyme active site architecture.</p>

<p>Thioamide drugs, ethionamide (ETH) and prothionamide (PTH), are clinically effective in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. leprae, and M. avium complex infections. Although generally considered second-line drugs for tuberculosis, their use has increased considerably as the number of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis cases continues to rise. Despite the widespread use of thioamide drugs to treat tuberculosis and leprosy, their precise mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a cell-based activation method, we now have definitive evidence that both thioamides form covalent adducts with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and that these adducts are tight-binding inhibitors of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae InhA. The crystal structures of the inhibited M. leprae and M. tuberculosis InhA complexes provide the molecular details of target-drug interactions. The purified ETH-NAD and PTH-NAD adducts both showed nanomolar Kis against M. tuberculosis and M. leprae InhA. Knowledge of the precise structures and mechanisms of action of these drugs provides insights into designing new drugs that can overcome drug resistance.</p>

<p>The in vitro evolution and engineering of quorum-quenching lactonases with enhanced reactivities was achieved using a thermostable GKL enzyme as a template, yielding the E101G/R230C GKL mutant with increased catalytic activity and a broadened substrate range [Chow, J. Y., Xue, B., Lee, K. H., Tung, A., Wu, L., Robinson, R. C., and Yew, W. S. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 40911-40920]. This enzyme possesses the (β/α)8-barrel fold and is a member of the PLL (phosphotriesterase-like lactonase) group of enzymes within the amidohydrolase superfamily that hydrolyze N-acyl-homoserine lactones, which mediate the quorum-sensing pathways of bacteria. The structure of the evolved N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone (substrate)-bound E101G/R230C GKL enzyme was determined, in the presence of the inactivating D266N mutation, to a resolution of 2.2 Å to provide an explanation for the observed rate enhancements. In addition, the substrate-bound structure of the catalytically inactive E101N/D266N mutant of the manganese-reconstituted enzyme was determined to a resolution of 2.1 Å and the structure of the ligand-free, manganese-reconstituted E101N mutant to a resolution of 2.6 Å, and the structures of ligand-free zinc-reconstituted wild-type, E101N, R230D, and E101G/R230C mutants of GKL were determined to resolutions of 2.1, 2.1, 1.9, and 2.0 Å, respectively. In particular, the structure of the evolved E101G/R230C mutant of GKL provides evidence of a catalytically productive active site architecture that contributes to the observed enhancement of catalysis.

<p>High-quality crystals of Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu in the GTP-bound conformation at 1.7-2.7 Å resolution were used to test 18 small organic molecules, all brominated for confident identification in the anomalous difference maps. From this relatively small collection, it was possible to identify a small molecule bound in the functionally important tRNA CCA-end binding pocket. The antibiotic GE2270 A is known to interact with the same pocket in EF-Tu and to disrupt the association with tRNA. Bromide could be located from peaks in the anomalous map in data truncated to very low resolution without refining the structure. Considering the speed with which diffraction data can be collected today, it is proposed that it is worthwhile to collect the extra data from fragment screens while crystals are at hand to increase the knowledge of biological function and drug binding in an experimental structural context. </p>

<p>Pathogenic protozoa such as Trypanosome and Leishmania species cause tremendous suffering worldwide. Because of their dependence on glycolysis for energy, the glycolytic enzymes of these organisms, including glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), are considered attractive drug targets. Using the adenine part of NAD as a lead compound, several 2,6-disubstituted purines were synthesized as inhibitors of Leishmania mexicana GPDH (LmGPDH). The electron densities for the inhibitor 2-bromo-6-chloro-purine bound to LmGPDH using a "conventional" wavelength around 1 A displayed a quasisymmetric shape. The anomalous signals from data collected at 1.77 A clearly indicated the positions of the halogen atoms and revealed the multiple binding modes of this inhibitor. Intriguing differences in the observed binding modes of the inhibitor between very similarly prepared crystals illustrate the possibility of crystal-to-crystal variations in protein-ligand complex structures.</p>

<p>For several decades, molecular recognition has been considered one of the most fundamental processes in biochemistry. For enzymes, substrate binding is often coupled to conformational changes that alter the local environment of the active site to align the reactive groups for efficient catalysis and to reach the transition state. Adaptive substrate recognition is a well-known concept; however, it has been poorly characterized at a structural level because of its dynamic nature. Here, we provide a detailed mechanism for an induced-fit process at atomic resolution. We take advantage of a slow, tight binding inhibitor-enzyme system, actinonin-peptide deformylase. Crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state were solved, as well as those of several intermediate mimics captured during the process. Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, which is finally "zipped up" by additional binding interactions. Together with biochemical analyses, these data allow a coherent reconstruction of the sequence of events leading from the encounter complex to the key-lock binding state of the enzyme. A "movie" that reconstructs this entire process can be further extrapolated to catalysis.</p>

<p>Mandelate racemase (MR) from Pseudomonas putida catalyzes the Mg(2+)-dependent 1,1-proton transfer that interconverts the enantiomers of mandelate. Because trifluorolactate is also a substrate of MR, we anticipated that replacing the phenyl rings of the competitive, substrate-product analogue inhibitor benzilate (Ki = 0.7 mM) with trifluoromethyl groups might furnish an inhibitor. Surprisingly, the substrate-product analogue 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanoate (TFHTP) was a potent competitive inhibitor [Ki = 27 ± 4 μM; cf. Km = 1.2 mM for both (R)-mandelate and (R)-trifluorolactate]. To understand the origins of this high binding affinity, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the MR-TFHTP complex to 1.68 Å resolution. Rather than chelating the active site Mg(2+) with its glycolate moiety, like other ground state analogues, TFHTP exhibited a novel binding mode with the two trifluoromethyl groups closely packed against the 20s loop and the carboxylate bridging the two active site Brønsted acid-base catalysts Lys 166 and His 297. Recognizing that positioning a carboxylate between the Brønsted acid-base catalysts could yield an inhibitor, we showed that tartronate was a competitive inhibitor of MR (Ki = 1.8 ± 0.1 mM). The X-ray crystal structure of the MR-tartronate complex (1.80 Å resolution) revealed that the glycolate moiety of tartronate chelated the Mg(2+) and that the carboxylate bridged Lys 166 and His 297. Models of tartronate in monomers A and B of the crystal structure mimicked the binding orientations of (S)-mandelate and that anticipated for (R)-mandelate, respectively. For the latter monomer, the 20s loop appeared to be disordered, as it also did in the X-ray structure of the MR triple mutant (C92S/C264S/K166C) complexed with benzilate, which was determined to 1.89 Å resolution. These observations indicate that the 20s loop likely undergoes a significant conformational change upon binding (R)-mandelate. In general, our observations suggest that inhibitors of other enolase superfamily enzymes may be designed to capitalize on the recognition of the active site Brønsted acid-base catalysts as binding determinants. </p>

<p>Cells devote a significant effort toward the production of multiple modified nucleotides in rRNAs, which fine tune the ribosome function. Here, we report that two methyltransferases, RsmB and RsmF, are responsible for all four 5-methylcytidine (m(5)C) modifications in 16S rRNA of Thermus thermophilus. Like Escherichia coli RsmB, T. thermophilus RsmB produces m(5)C967. In contrast to E. coli RsmF, which introduces a single m(5)C1407 modification, T. thermophilus RsmF modifies three positions, generating m(5)C1400 and m(5)C1404 in addition to m(5)C1407. These three residues are clustered near the decoding site of the ribosome, but are situated in distinct structural contexts, suggesting a requirement for flexibility in the RsmF active site that is absent from the E. coli enzyme. Two of these residues, C1400 and C1404, are sufficiently buried in the mature ribosome structure so as to require extensive unfolding of the rRNA to be accessible to RsmF. In vitro, T. thermophilus RsmF methylates C1400, C1404, and C1407 in a 30S subunit substrate, but only C1400 and C1404 when naked 16S rRNA is the substrate. The multispecificity of T. thermophilus RsmF is potentially explained by three crystal structures of the enzyme in a complex with cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine at up to 1.3 A resolution. In addition to confirming the overall structural similarity to E. coli RsmF, these structures also reveal that key segments in the active site are likely to be dynamic in solution, thereby expanding substrate recognition by T. thermophilus RsmF.</p>

<p>Molecular evolution is driven by mutations, which may affect the fitness of an organism and are then subject to natural selection or genetic drift. Analysis of primary protein sequences and tertiary structures has yielded valuable insights into the evolution of protein function, but little is known about the evolution of functional mechanisms, protein dynamics and conformational plasticity essential for activity. We characterized the atomic-level motions across divergent members of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) family. Despite structural similarity, Escherichia coli and human DHFRs use different dynamic mechanisms to perform the same function, and human DHFR cannot complement DHFR-deficient E. coli cells. Identification of the primary-sequence determinants of flexibility in DHFRs from several species allowed us to propose a likely scenario for the evolution of functionally important DHFR dynamics following a pattern of divergent evolution that is tuned by cellular environment. </p>

<p>The screening of known HIV-1 protease inhibitors against a panel of multi-drug-resistant viruses revealed the potent activity of TMC126 on drug-resistant mutants. In comparison to amprenavir, the improved affinity of TMC126 is largely the result of one extra hydrogen bond to the backbone of the protein in the P2 pocket. Modification of the substitution pattern on the phenylsulfonamide P2' substituent of TMC126 created an interesting SAR, with the close analogue TMC114 being found to have a similar antiviral activity against the mutant and the wild-type viruses. X-ray and thermodynamic studies on both wild-type and mutant enzymes showed an extremely high enthalpy driven affinity of TMC114 for HIV-1 protease. In vitro selection of mutants resistant to TMC114 starting from wild-type virus proved to be extremely difficult; this was not the case for other close analogues. Therefore, the extra H-bond to the backbone in the P2 pocket cannot be the only explanation for the interesting antiviral profile of TMC114. Absorption studies in animals indicated that TMC114 has pharmacokinetic properties comparable to currently approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>Heme-containing catalases have been extensively studied, revealing the roles of many residues, the existence of two heme orientations, flipped 180° relative to one another along the propionate-vinyl axis, and the presence of both heme b and heme d. The focus of this report is a residue, situated adjacent to the vinyl groups of the heme at the entrance of the lateral channel, with an unusual main chain geometry that is conserved in all catalase structures so far determined. In Escherichia coli catalase HPII, the residue is Ile274, and replacing it with Gly, Ala, and Val, found at the same location in other catalases, results in a reduction in catalytic efficiency, a reduced intensity of the Soret absorbance band, and a mixture of heme orientations and species. The reduced turnover rates and higher H(2)O(2) concentrations required to attain equivalent reaction velocities are explained in terms of less efficient containment of substrate H(2)O(2) in the heme cavity arising from easier escape through the more open entrance to the lateral channel created by the smaller side chains of Gly and Ala. Inserting a Cys at position 274 resulted in the heme being covalently linked to the protein through a Cys-vinyl bond that is hypersensitive to X-ray irradiation being largely degraded within seconds of exposure to the X-ray beam. Two heme orientations, flipped along the propionate-vinyl axis, are found in the Ala, Val, and Cys variants.</p>

<p>A series of crystal structures of trypsin, containing either an autoproteolytic cleaved peptide fragment or a covalently bound inhibitor, were determined at atomic and ultra-high resolution and subjected to ab initio quantum chemical calculations and multipole refinement. Quantum chemical calculations reproduced the observed active site crystal structure with severe deviations from standard stereochemistry and indicated the protonation state of the catalytic residues. Multipole refinement directly revealed the charge distribution in the active site and proved the validity of the ab initio calculations. The combined results confirmed the catalytic function of the active site residues and the two water molecules acting as the nucleophile and the proton donor. The crystal structures represent snapshots from the reaction pathway, close to a tetrahedral intermediate. The de-acylation of trypsin then occurs in true SN2 fashion.</p>

<p>Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.</p>

<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has an essential role in multiple signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and migration, through extracellular ligand binding and subsequent activation of its intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-associated EGFR mutants, L858R and G719S, are constitutively active and oncogenic. They display sensitivity to TK inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib. In contrast, the secondary mutation of the gatekeeper residue, T790M, reportedly confers inhibitor resistance on the oncogenic EGFR mutants. In this study, our biochemical analyses revealed that the introduction of the T790M mutation confers gefitinib resistance on the G719S mutant. The G719S/T790M double mutant has enhanced activity and retains high gefitinib-binding affinity. The T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the G719S mutant, explaining the acquired drug resistance of the double mutant. Structural analyses of the G719S/T790M double mutant, as well as the wild type and the G719S and L858R mutants, revealed that the T790M mutation stabilizes the hydrophobic spine of the active EGFR-TK conformation. The Met790 side chain of the G719S/T790M double mutant, in the apo form and gefitinib- and AMPPNP-bound forms, adopts different conformations that explain the accommodation of these ligands. In the L858R mutant structure, the active-site cleft is expanded by the repositioning of Phe723 within the P-loop. Notably, the introduction of the F723A mutation greatly enhanced the gefitinib sensitivity of the wild-type EGFR in vivo, supporting our hypothesis that the expansion of the active-site cleft results in enhanced gefitinib sensitivity. Taken together, our results provide a structural basis for the altered drug sensitivities caused by distinct NSCLC-associated EGFR mutations.</p>

<p>Mutants of a cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase (NHase, EC 4.2.1.84) from Pseudonocardia thermophila JCM 3095 involved in substrate binding, catalysis and formation of the active center were constructed, and their characteristics and crystal structures were investigated. As expected from the structure of the substrate binding pocket, the wild-type enzyme showed significantly lower K(m) and K(i) values for aromatic substrates and inhibitors, respectively, than aliphatic ones. In the crystal structure of a complex with an inhibitor (n-butyric acid) the hydroxyl group of betaTyr68 formed hydrogen bonds with both n-butyric acid and alphaSer112, which is located in the active center. The betaY68F mutant showed an elevated K(m) value and a significantly decreased k(cat) value. The apoenzyme, which contains no detectable cobalt atom, was prepared from Escherichia coli cells grown in medium without cobalt ions. It showed no detectable activity. A disulfide bond between alphaCys108 and alphaCys113 was formed in the apoenzyme structure. In the highly conserved sequence motif in the cysteine cluster region, two positions are exclusively conserved in cobalt-containing or iron-containing nitrile hydratases. Two mutants (alphaT109S and alphaY114T) were constructed, each residue being replaced with an iron-containing one. The alphaT109S mutant showed similar characteristics to the wild-type enzyme. However, the alphaY114T mutant showed a very low cobalt content and catalytic activity compared with the wild-type enzyme, and oxidative modifications of alphaCys111 and alphaCys113 residues were not observed. The alphaTyr114 residue may be involved in the interaction with the nitrile hydratase activator protein of P. thermophila.</p>

<p>Formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) amidotransferase (FGAR-AT) takes part in purine biosynthesis and is a multidomain enzyme with multiple spatially separated active sites. FGAR-AT contains a glutaminase domain that is responsible for the generation of ammonia from glutamine. Ammonia is then transferred via a channel to a second active site located in the synthetase domain and utilized to convert FGAR to formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM) in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dependent reaction. In some ammonia-channelling enzymes ligand binding triggers interdomain signalling between the two diverse active centres and also assists in formation of the ammonia channel. Previously, the structure of FGAR-AT from Salmonella typhimurium containing a glutamyl thioester intermediate covalently bound in the glutaminase active site was determined. In this work, the roles played by various ligands of FGAR-AT in inducing catalytic coupling are investigated. Structures of FGAR-AT from S. typhimurium were determined in two different states: the unliganded form and the binary complex with an ATP analogue in the presence of the glutamyl thioester intermediate. The structures were compared in order to decipher the roles of these two states in interdomain communication. Using a process of elimination, the results indicated that binding of FGAR is most likely to be the major mechanism by which catalytic coupling occurs. This is because conformational changes do not occur either upon formation of the glutamyl thioester intermediate or upon subsequent ATP complexation. A model of the FGAR-bound form of the enzyme suggested that the loop in the synthetase domain may be responsible for initiating catalytic coupling via its interaction with the N-terminal domain.</p>

<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has an essential role in multiple signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and migration, through extracellular ligand binding and subsequent activation of its intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-associated EGFR mutants, L858R and G719S, are constitutively active and oncogenic. They display sensitivity to TK inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib. In contrast, the secondary mutation of the gatekeeper residue, T790M, reportedly confers inhibitor resistance on the oncogenic EGFR mutants. In this study, our biochemical analyses revealed that the introduction of the T790M mutation confers gefitinib resistance on the G719S mutant. The G719S/T790M double mutant has enhanced activity and retains high gefitinib-binding affinity. The T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the G719S mutant, explaining the acquired drug resistance of the double mutant. Structural analyses of the G719S/T790M double mutant, as well as the wild type and the G719S and L858R mutants, revealed that the T790M mutation stabilizes the hydrophobic spine of the active EGFR-TK conformation. The Met790 side chain of the G719S/T790M double mutant, in the apo form and gefitinib- and AMPPNP-bound forms, adopts different conformations that explain the accommodation of these ligands. In the L858R mutant structure, the active-site cleft is expanded by the repositioning of Phe723 within the P-loop. Notably, the introduction of the F723A mutation greatly enhanced the gefitinib sensitivity of the wild-type EGFR in vivo, supporting our hypothesis that the expansion of the active-site cleft results in enhanced gefitinib sensitivity. Taken together, our results provide a structural basis for the altered drug sensitivities caused by distinct NSCLC-associated EGFR mutations.</p>

<p>The pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme assembly (PDH) generates acetyl coenzyme A and reducing equivalents from pyruvate in a multiple-step process that is a nexus of central metabolism. We report crystal structures of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus PDH E1p subunit with ligands that mimic the prereaction complex and the postdecarboxylation product. The structures implicate residues that help to orient substrates, nurture intermediates, and organize surface loops so that they can engage a mobile lipoyl domain that receives the acetyl group and shuttles it to the next active site. The structural and enzymatic data suggest that H128beta performs a dual role: first, as electrostatic catalyst of the reaction of pyruvate with the thiamine cofactor; and second, as a proton donor in the second reaction of acetyl group with the lipoate. We also identify I206alpha as a key residue in mediating the conformation of active-site loops. We propose that a simple conformational flip of the H271alpha side chain assists transfer of the acetyl group from thiamine cofactor to lipoyl domain in synchrony with reduction of the dithiolane ring.</p>

<p>Potent anticoagulants have been derived by targeting the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex with naive peptide libraries displayed on M13 phage. The peptides specifically block the activation of factor X with a median inhibitory concentration of 1 nM and selectively inhibit tissue-factor-dependent clotting. The peptides do not bind to the active site of factor VIIa; rather, they work by binding to an exosite on the factor VIIa protease domain, and non-competitively inhibit activation of factor X and amidolytic activity. One such peptide (E-76) has a well defined structure in solution determined by NMR spectroscopy that is similar to the X-ray crystal structure when complexed with factor VIIa. These structural and functional studies indicate an allosteric 'switch' mechanism of inhibition involving an activation loop of factor VIIa and represent a new framework for developing inhibitors of serine proteases.</p>

<p>The DEAD box helicase DDX6/Me31B functions in translational repression and mRNA decapping. How particular RNA helicases are recruited specifically to distinct functional complexes is poorly understood. We present the crystal structure of the DDX6 C-terminal RecA-like domain bound to a highly conserved FDF sequence motif in the decapping activator EDC3. The FDF peptide adopts an alpha-helical conformation upon binding to DDX6, occupying a shallow groove opposite to the DDX6 surface involved in RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. Mutagenesis of Me31B shows the relevance of the FDF interaction surface both for Me31B's accumulation in P bodies and for its ability to repress the expression of bound mRNAs. The translational repressor Tral contains a similar FDF motif. Together with mutational and competition studies, the structure reveals why the interactions of Me31B with EDC3 and Tral are mutually exclusive and how the respective decapping and translational repressor complexes might hook onto an mRNA substrate.</p>

<p>Autotaxin (ATX), also known as ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2), was originally identified as a tumor cell autocrine motility factor and was found to be identical to plasma lysophospholipase D, which is the predominant contributor to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) production from lysophospholipids. ATX is therefore considered to regulate the physiological and pathological roles of LPA, including angiogenesis, lymphocyte trafficking, tissue fibrosis, and cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Thus, it is a potential therapeutic target. Here, we first developed a sensitive and specific ATX fluorescence probe, TG-mTMP, and used it to screen ATX inhibitors in a large chemical library. This probe, which is superior to previously available probes FS-3 and CPF4 in terms of sensitivity or specificity, enabled us to identify several novel ATX inhibitor scaffolds. We solved the crystal structures of ATX complexes with the hit compounds at high resolution (1.75-1.95 Å) and used this information to guide optimization of the structure of a selected inhibitor. The optimized compounds, 3BoA and its derivatives, exhibited potent ATX-inhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo. These inhibitors are expected to be useful tools to understand the roles of ATX in vitro and in vivo and may also be candidate anti-ATX therapeutic agents. </p>

<p>The crystal structure of a copper amine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis was determined at 1.08 Å resolution with the use of low-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol (LMW PEG; average molecular weight ∼200) as a cryoprotectant. The final crystallographic R factor and Rfree were 13.0 and 15.0%, respectively. Several molecules of LMW PEG were found to occupy cavities in the protein interior, including the active site, which resulted in a marked reduction in the overall B factor and consequently led to a subatomic resolution structure for a relatively large protein with a monomer molecular weight of ∼70,000. About 40% of the presumed H atoms were observed as clear electron densities in the Fo - Fc difference map. Multiple minor conformers were also identified for many residues. Anisotropic displacement fluctuations were evaluated in the active site, which contains a post-translationally derived quinone cofactor and a Cu atom. Furthermore, diatomic molecules, most likely to be molecular oxygen, are bound to the protein, one of which is located in a region that had previously been proposed as an entry route for the dioxygen substrate from the central cavity of the dimer interface to the active site.</p>

<p>Multifunctional proteins, which play a critical role in many biological processes, have typically evolved through the recruitment of different domains that have the required functional diversity. Thus the different activities displayed by these proteins are mediated by spatially distinct domains, consistent with the specific chemical requirements of each activity. Indeed, current evolutionary theory argues that the colocalization of diverse activities within an enzyme is likely to be a rare event, because it would compromise the existing activity of the protein. In contrast to this view, a potential example of multifunctional recruitment into a single protein domain is provided by CtCel5C-CE2, which contains an N-terminal module that displays cellulase activity and a C-terminal module, CtCE2, which exhibits a noncatalytic cellulose-binding function but also shares sequence identity with the CE2 family of esterases. Here we show that, unlike other CE2 members, the CtCE2 domain displays divergent catalytic esterase and noncatalytic carbohydrate binding functions. Intriguingly, these diverse activities are housed within the same site on the protein. Thus, a critical component of the active site of CtCE2, the catalytic Ser-His dyad, in harness with inserted aromatic residues, confers noncatalytic binding to cellulose whilst the active site of the domain retains its esterase activity. CtCE2 catalyses deacetylation of noncellulosic plant structural polysaccharides to deprotect these substrates for attack by other enzymes. Yet it also acts as a cellulose-binding domain, which promotes the activity of the appended cellulase on recalcitrant substrates. The CE2 family encapsulates the requirement for multiple activities by biocatalysts that attack challenging macromolecular substrates, including the grafting of a second, powerful and discrete noncatalytic binding functionality into the active site of an enzyme. This article provides a rare example of "gene sharing," where the introduction of a second functionality into the active site of an enzyme does not compromise the original activity of the biocatalyst.</p>

<p>Lignin forms from the polymerization of phenylpropanoid-derived building blocks (the monolignols), whose modification through hydroxylation and O-methylation modulates the chemical and physical properties of the lignin polymer. The enzyme caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) is central to lignin biosynthesis. It is often targeted in attempts to engineer the lignin composition of transgenic plants for improved forage digestibility, pulping efficiency, or utility in biofuel production. Despite intensive investigation, the structural determinants of the regiospecificity and substrate selectivity of COMT remain poorly defined. Reported here are x-ray crystallographic structures of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) COMT (Lp OMT1) in open conformational state, apo- and holoenzyme forms and, most significantly, in a closed conformational state complexed with the products S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and sinapaldehyde. The product-bound complex reveals the post-methyl-transfer organization of COMT's catalytic groups with reactant molecules and the fully formed phenolic-ligand binding site. The core scaffold of the phenolic ligand forges a hydrogen-bonding network involving the 4-hydroxy group that anchors the aromatic ring and thereby permits only metahydroxyl groups to be positioned for transmethylation. While distal from the site of transmethylation, the propanoid tail substituent governs the kinetic preference of ryegrass COMT for aldehydes over alcohols and acids due to a single hydrogen bond donor for the C9 oxygenated moiety dictating the preference for an aldehyde.</p>

<p>Heme-containing catalases have been extensively studied, revealing the roles of many residues, the existence of two heme orientations, flipped 180° relative to one another along the propionate-vinyl axis, and the presence of both heme b and heme d. The focus of this report is a residue, situated adjacent to the vinyl groups of the heme at the entrance of the lateral channel, with an unusual main chain geometry that is conserved in all catalase structures so far determined. In Escherichia coli catalase HPII, the residue is Ile274, and replacing it with Gly, Ala, and Val, found at the same location in other catalases, results in a reduction in catalytic efficiency, a reduced intensity of the Soret absorbance band, and a mixture of heme orientations and species. The reduced turnover rates and higher H(2)O(2) concentrations required to attain equivalent reaction velocities are explained in terms of less efficient containment of substrate H(2)O(2) in the heme cavity arising from easier escape through the more open entrance to the lateral channel created by the smaller side chains of Gly and Ala. Inserting a Cys at position 274 resulted in the heme being covalently linked to the protein through a Cys-vinyl bond that is hypersensitive to X-ray irradiation being largely degraded within seconds of exposure to the X-ray beam. Two heme orientations, flipped along the propionate-vinyl axis, are found in the Ala, Val, and Cys variants.</p>

<p>Sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) that catalyzes the removal of the 14α-methyl group from the sterol nucleus is an essential enzyme in sterol biosynthesis, a primary target for clinical and agricultural antifungal azoles and an emerging target for antitrypanosomal chemotherapy. Here, we present the crystal structure of Trypanosoma (T) brucei CYP51 in complex with the substrate analog 14α-methylenecyclopropyl-Δ7-24,25-dihydrolanosterol (MCP). This sterol binds tightly to all protozoan CYP51s and acts as a competitive inhibitor of F105-containing (plant-like) T. brucei and Leishmania (L) infantum orthologs, but it has a much stronger, mechanism-based inhibitory effect on I105-containing (animal/fungi-like) T. cruzi CYP51. Depicting substrate orientation in the conserved CYP51 binding cavity, the complex specifies the roles of the contact amino acid residues and sheds new light on CYP51 substrate specificity. It also provides an explanation for the effect of MCP on T. cruzi CYP51. Comparison with the ligand-free and azole-bound structures supports the notion of structural rigidity as the characteristic feature of the CYP51 substrate binding cavity, confirming the enzyme as an excellent candidate for structure-directed design of new drugs, including mechanism-based substrate analog inhibitors.</p>

<p>Efficient enzyme catalysis depends on exquisite details of structure beyond those resolvable in typical medium- and high-resolution crystallographic analyses. Here we report synchrotron-based cryocrystallographic studies of natural substrate complexes of the flavoenzyme human glutathione reductase (GR) at nominal resolutions between 1.1 and 0.95 A that reveal new aspects of its mechanism. Compression in the active site causes overlapping van der Waals radii and distortion in the nicotinamide ring of the NADPH substrate, which enhances catalysis via stereoelectronic effects. The bound NADPH and redox-active disulfide are positioned optimally on opposite sides of the flavin for a 1,2-addition across a flavin double bond. The new structures extend earlier observations to reveal that the redox-active disulfide loop in GR is an extreme case of sequential peptide bonds systematically deviating from planarity--a net deviation of 53 degrees across five residues. But this apparent strain is not a factor in catalysis, as it is present in both oxidized and reduced structures. Intriguingly, the flavin bond lengths in oxidized GR are intermediate between those expected for oxidized and reduced flavin, but we present evidence that this may not be due to the protein environment but instead due to partial synchrotron reduction of the flavin by the synchrotron beam. Finally, of more general relevance, we present evidence that the structures of synchrotron-reduced disulfide bonds cannot generally be used as reliable models for naturally reduced disulfide bonds.</p>

<p>Cytosine methylation promotes deamination. In eukaryotes, CpG methylation is thought to account for CpG underrepresentation. Whether scarcity of CpGs in prokaryotic genomes is diagnostic for methylation is not clear. Here, we report that Mycoplasms tend to be CpG depleted and to harbor a family of constitutively expressed or phase variable CpG-specific DNA methyltransferases. The very CpG poor Mycoplasma penetrans and its constitutively active CpG-specific methyltransferase M.MpeI were chosen for further characterization. Genome-wide sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA indicated that M.MpeI methylated CpG target sites both in vivo and in vitro in a locus-nonselective manner. A crystal structure of M.MpeI with DNA at 2.15-Å resolution showed that the substrate base was flipped and that its place in the DNA stack was taken by a glutamine residue. A phenylalanine residue was intercalated into the "weak" CpG step of the nonsubstrate strand, indicating mechanistic similarities in the recognition of the short CpG target sequence by prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases.</p>

<p>Recently, we designed a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors incorporating a stereochemically defined bicyclic fused cyclopentyl (Cp-THF) urethane as the high affinity P2-ligand. Inhibitor with this P2-ligand has shown very impressive potency against multi-drug-resistant clinical isolates. Based upon the -bound HIV-1 protease X-ray structure, we have now designed and synthesized a number of meso-bicyclic ligands which can conceivably interact similarly to the Cp-THF ligand. The design of meso-ligands is quite attractive as they do not contain any stereocenters. Inhibitors incorporating urethanes of bicyclic-1,3-dioxolane and bicyclic-1,4-dioxane have shown potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activities. Inhibitor (K(i) = 0.11 nM; IC(50) = 3.8 nM) displayed very potent antiviral activity in this series. While inhibitor showed comparable enzyme inhibitory activity (K(i) = 0.18 nM) its antiviral activity (IC(50) = 170 nM) was significantly weaker than inhibitor . Inhibitor maintained an antiviral potency against a series of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates comparable to amprenavir. A protein-ligand X-ray structure of -bound HIV-1 protease revealed a number of key hydrogen bonding interactions at the S2-subsite. We have created an active model of inhibitor based upon this X-ray structure.</p>

<p>Opium is one of the world's oldest drugs, and its derivatives morphine and codeine are among the most used clinical drugs to relieve severe pain. These prototypical opioids produce analgesia as well as many undesirable side effects (sedation, apnoea and dependence) by binding to and activating the G-protein-coupled µ-opioid receptor (µ-OR) in the central nervous system. Here we describe the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the mouse µ-OR in complex with an irreversible morphinan antagonist. Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G-protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest, the µ-OR crystallizes as a two-fold symmetrical dimer through a four-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6. These high-resolution insights into opioid receptor structure will enable the application of structure-based approaches to develop better drugs for the management of pain and addiction.</p>

<p>Human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) hydrolyzes or scavenges a wide range of toxic esters, including heroin, cocaine, carbamate pesticides, organophosphorus pesticides, and nerve agents. Organophosphates (OPs) exert their acute toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by phosphorylation of the catalytic serine. Phosphylated cholinesterase (ChE) can undergo a spontaneous, time-dependent process called "aging", during which the OP-ChE conjugate is dealkylated. This leads to irreversible inhibition of the enzyme. The inhibition of ChEs by tabun and the subsequent aging reaction are of particular interest, because tabun-ChE conjugates display an extraordinary resistance toward most current oxime reactivators. We investigated the structural basis of oxime resistance for phosphoramidated ChE conjugates by determining the crystal structures of the non-aged and aged forms of hBChE inhibited by tabun, and by updating the refinement of non-aged and aged tabun-inhibited mouse AChE (mAChE). Structures for non-aged and aged tabun-hBChE were refined to 2.3 and 2.1 A, respectively. The refined structures of aged ChE conjugates clearly show that the aging reaction proceeds through O-dealkylation of the P(R) enantiomer of tabun. After dealkylation, the negatively charged oxygen forms a strong salt bridge with protonated His438N epsilon2 that prevents reactivation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the aged tabun-inhibited hBChE showed that both the dimethylamine and ethoxy side chains were missing from the phosphorus. Loss of the ethoxy is consistent with the crystallography results. Loss of the dimethylamine is consistent with acid-catalyzed deamidation during the preparation of the aged adduct for mass spectrometry. The reported 3D data will help in the design of new oximes capable of reactivating tabun-ChE conjugates.</p>

<p>There is conflicting evidence as to whether cavities in proteins that are nonpolar and large enough to accommodate solvent are empty or are occupied by disordered water molecules. Here, we use multiple-wavelength x-ray data collected from crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted L99A/M102L mutant of T4 lysozyme to obtain a high-resolution electron density map free of bias that is unavoidably associated with conventional model-based structure determination and refinement. The mutant, L99A/M102L, has four cavities, two being polar in character and the other two nonpolar. Cavity 1 (polar, volume 45.2 A(3)) was expected to contain two well ordered water molecules, and this is confirmed in the experimental electron density map. Likewise, cavity 2 (polar, 16.9 A(3)) is confirmed to contain a single water molecule. Cavity 3 (nonpolar, 21.4 A(3)) was seen to be empty in conventional x-ray refinement, and this is confirmed in the experimental map. Unexpectedly, however, cavity 4 (nonpolar, volume 133.5 A(3)) was seen to contain diffuse electron density equivalent to approximately 1.5 water molecules. Although cavity 4 is largely nonpolar, it does have some polar character, and this apparently contributes to the presence of solvent. The cavity is large enough to accommodate four to five water molecules, and it appears that a hydrogen-bonded chain of three or more solvent molecules could occupy the cavity at a given time. The results are consistent with theoretical predictions that cavities in proteins that are strictly nonpolar will not contain solvent until the volume is large enough to permit mutually satisfying water-water hydrogen bonds.</p>

<p>The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel C3-substituted cyclopentyltetrahydrofuranyl (Cp-THF)-derived HIV-1 protease inhibitors are described. Various C3-functional groups on the Cp-THF ligand were investigated in order to maximize the ligand-binding site interactions in the flap region of the protease. Inhibitors 3c and 3d have displayed the most potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activity. Both inhibitors have maintained impressive activity against a panel of multidrug resistant HIV-1 variants. A high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of 3c-bound HIV-1 protease revealed a number of important molecular insights into the ligand-binding site interactions.</p>

<p>In fragment-based drug discovery, the weak affinities exhibited by fragments pose significant challenges for screening. Biophysical techniques are used to address this challenge, but there is no clear consensus on which cascade of methods is best suited to identify fragment hits that ultimately translate into bound X-ray structures and provide bona fide starting points for synthesis. We have benchmarked an integrated biophysical approach for fragment screening and validation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis pantothenate synthetase. A primary screen of 1,250 fragments library was performed by thermal shift, followed by secondary screen using one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (water ligand observed gradient spectroscopy and saturation transfer difference binding experiments) and ultimate hit validation by isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography. Our multibiophysical approach identified three distinct binding sites for fragments and laid a solid foundation for successful structure-based elaboration into potent inhibitors. </p>

<p>Trypanosomatids consist of a large group of flagellated parasitic protozoa, including parasites from the genera Leishmania and Trypanosoma, responsible for causing infections in millions of humans worldwide and for which currently no appropriate therapy is available. The significance of pyrimidines in cellular metabolism makes their de novo and salvage pathways ideal druggable targets for pharmacological intervention and open an opportunity for pharmaceutical innovation. In the current review, we discuss the merits in targeting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a flavin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the fourth and only redox step in pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis, as a strategy for the development of efficient therapeutic strategies for trypanosomatid-related diseases.We also describe the advances and perspectives from the structural biology point of view in order to unravel the structure-function relationship of trypanosomatid DHODHs, and to identify and validate target sites for drug development.</p>

<p>Aldehyde dehydrogenases are found in all organisms and play an important role in the metabolic conversion and detoxification of endogenous and exogenous aldehydes. Genomes of many organisms including Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium encode two succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenases with low sequence similarity and different cofactor preference (YneI and GabD). Here, we present the crystal structure and biochemical characterization of the NAD(P)(+)-dependent succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase YneI from S. typhimurium. This enzyme shows high activity and affinity toward succinate semialdehyde and exhibits substrate inhibition at concentrations of SSA higher than 0.1 mM. YneI can use both NAD(+) and NADP(+) as cofactors, although affinity to NAD(+) is 10 times higher. High resolution crystal structures of YneI were solved in a free state (1.85 Å) and in complex with NAD(+) (1.90 Å) revealing a two domain protein with the active site located in the interdomain interface. The NAD(+) molecule is bound in the long channel with its nicotinamide ring positioned close to the side chain of the catalytic Cys268. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this residue, as well as the conserved Trp136, Glu365, and Asp426 are important for activity of YneI, and that the conserved Lys160 contributes to the enzyme preference to NAD(+) . Our work has provided further insight into the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and activity of succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenases.</p>

<p>Until recently, the mechanism of mRNA decay in bacteria was thought to be different from that of eukaryotes. This paradigm changed with the discovery that RppH (ORF176/NudH/YgdP), an Escherichia coli enzyme that belongs to the Nudix superfamily, is an RNA pyrophosphohydrolase that initiates mRNA decay by cleaving pyrophosphate from the 5'-triphosphate. Here we report the 1.9 Angstroms resolution structure of the Nudix hydrolase BdRppH from Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a bacterium that feeds on other Gram-negative bacteria. Based on the structure of the enzyme alone and in complex with GTP-Mg2+, we propose a mode of RNA binding similar to that of the nuclear decapping enzyme from Xenopus laevis, X29. In additional experiments, we show that BdRppH can indeed function in vitro and in vivo as an RNA pyrophosphohydrolase. These findings set the basis for the identification of possible decapping enzymes in other bacteria.</p>

<p>The first step of the reaction catalyzed by the homodimeric FabH from a dissociated fatty acid synthase is acyl transfer from acyl-CoA to an active site cysteine. We report that C1 to C10 alkyl-CoA disulfides irreversibly inhibit Escherichia coli FabH (ecFabH) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis FabH with relative efficiencies that reflect these enzymes' differential acyl-group specificity. Crystallographic and kinetic studies with MeSSCoA show rapid inhibition of one monomer of ecFabH through formation of a methyl disulfide conjugate with this cysteine. Reaction of the second subunit with either MeSSCoA or acetyl-CoA is much slower. In the presence of malonyl-ACP, the acylation rate of the second subunit is restored to that of the native ecFabH. These observations suggest a catalytic model in which a structurally disordered apo-ecFabH dimer orders on binding either the first substrate, acetyl-CoA, or the inhibitor MeSSCoA, and is restored to a disordered state on binding of malonyl-ACP.</p>

<p>Resistance to kinase-targeted cancer drugs has recently been linked to a single point mutation in the ATP binding site of the kinase. In EGFR, the crucial Thr790 gatekeeper residue is mutated to a Met and prevents reversible ATP competitive inhibitors from binding. Irreversible 4-(phenylamino)quinazolines have been shown to overcome this drug resistance and are currently in clinical trials. In order to obtain a detailed structural understanding of how irreversible inhibitors overcome drug resistance, we used Src kinase as a model system for drug resistant EGFR-T790M. We report the first crystal structure of a drug resistant kinase in complex with an irreversible inhibitor. This 4-(phenylamino)quinazoline inhibits wild type and drug resistant EGFR in vitro at low nM concentrations. The co-crystal structure of drug resistant cSrc-T338M kinase domain provides the structural basis of this activity.</p>

<p>Ester bond hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids by Phospholipase A(2) and consequent release of fatty acids are the initiating steps of inflammation. It is proposed in this study that the inhibition of phospholipase A(2) is one of the ways to control inflammation. Investigations are carried out to identify the mode of inhibition of phospholipase A(2) by the n-hexadecanoic acid. It may help in designing of specific inhibitors of phospholipase A(2) as anti-inflammatory agents. The enzyme kinetics study proved that n-hexadecanoic acid inhibits phospholipase A(2) in a competitive manner. It was identified from the crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution that the position of n-hexadecanoic acid is in the active site of the phospholipase A(2). The binding constant and binding energy have also been calculated using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. Also, the binding energy of n-hexadecanoic acid to phospholipase A(2) was calculated by in silico method and compared with known inhibitors. It may be concluded from the structural and kinetics studies that the fatty acid, n-hexadecanoic acid, is an inhibitor of phospholipase A(2), hence, an anti-inflammatory compound. The inferences from the present study validate the rigorous use of medicated oils rich in n-hexadecanoic acid for the treatment of rheumatic symptoms in the traditional medical system of India, Ayurveda.</p>

<p>Of the nine genes comprising the L-rhamnose operon of Rhizobium leguminosarum, rhaU has not been assigned a function. The construction of a Delta rhaU strain revealed a growth phenotype that was slower than that of the wild-type strain, although the ultimate cell yields were equivalent. The transport of L-rhamnose into the cell and the rate of its phosphorylation were unaffected by the mutation. RhaU exhibits weak sequence similarity to the formerly hypothetical protein YiiL of Escherichia coli that has recently been characterized as an L-rhamnose mutarotase. To characterize RhaU further, a His-tagged variant of the protein was prepared and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, confirming the subunit size and demonstrating its dimeric structure. After crystallization, the structure was refined to a 1.6-A resolution to reveal a dimer in the asymmetric unit with a very similar structure to that of YiiL. Soaking a RhaU crystal with L-rhamnose resulted in the appearance of beta-L-rhamnose in the active site.</p>

<p>The x-ray crystal structures of five triclosan analogs, in addition to that of the isoniazid-NAD adduct, are described in relation to their integral role in the design of potent inhibitors of the malarial enzyme Plasmodium falciparum enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (PfENR). Many of the novel 5-substituted analogs exhibit low micromolar potency against in vitro cultures of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains of the P. falciparum parasite and inhibit purified PfENR enzyme with IC50 values of &lt;200 nM. This study has significantly expanded the knowledge base with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triclosan while affording gains against cultured parasites and purified PfENR enzyme. In contrast to a recent report in the literature, these results demonstrate the ability to improve the in vitro potency of triclosan significantly by replacing the suboptimal 5-chloro group with larger hydrophobic moieties. The biological and x-ray crystallographic data thus demonstrate the flexibility of the active site and point to future rounds of optimization to improve compound potency against purified enzyme and intracellular Plasmodium parasites.</p>

<p>DNA synthesis has been extensively studied, but the chemical reaction itself has not been visualized. Here we follow the course of phosphodiester bond formation using time-resolved X-ray crystallography. Native human DNA polymerase η, DNA and dATP were co-crystallized at pH 6.0 without Mg(2+). The polymerization reaction was initiated by exposing crystals to 1 mM Mg(2+) at pH 7.0, and stopped by freezing at desired time points for structural analysis. The substrates and two Mg(2+) ions are aligned within 40 s, but the bond formation is not evident until 80 s. From 80 to 300 s structures show a mixture of decreasing substrate and increasing product of the nucleotidyl-transfer reaction. Transient electron densities indicate that deprotonation and an accompanying C2'-endo to C3'-endo conversion of the nucleophile 3'-OH are rate limiting. A third Mg(2+) ion, which arrives with the new bond and stabilizes the intermediate state, may be an unappreciated feature of the two-metal-ion mechanism.</p>

<p>The reactive oxy intermediate of the catalytic cycle of extradiol aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenases is formed by binding the catecholic substrate and O2 in adjacent ligand positions of the active site metal [usually Fe(II)]. This intermediate and the following Fe(II)-alkylperoxo intermediate resulting from oxygen attack on the substrate have been previously characterized in a crystal of homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase (HPCD). Here a subsequent intermediate in which the O-O bond is broken to yield a gem diol species is structurally characterized. This new intermediate is stabilized in the crystal by using the alternative substrate, 4-sulfonylcatechol, and the Glu323Leu variant of HPCD, which alters the crystal packing.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase from Escherichia coli have been determined to 2.0-A resolution in the absence of ligands, and to 2.5-A resolution with the feedback inhibitor AMP bound to the PRPP catalytic site. Glutamine PRPP amidotransferase (GPATase) employs separate catalytic domains to abstract nitrogen from the amide of glutamine and to transfer nitrogen to the acceptor substrate PRPP. The unliganded and AMP-bound structures, which are essentially identical, are interpreted as the inhibited form of the enzyme because the two active sites are disconnected and the PRPP active site is solvent exposed. The structures were compared with a previously reported 3.0-A structure of the homologous Bacillus subtilis enzyme (Smith JL et al., 1994, Science 264:1427-1433). The comparison indicates a pattern of conservation of peptide structures involved with catalysis and variability in enzyme regulatory functions. Control of glutaminase activity, communication between the active sites, and regulation by feedback inhibitors are addressed differently by E. coli and B. subtilis GPATases. The E. coli enzyme is a prototype for the metal-free GPATases, whereas the B. subtilis enzyme represents the metal-containing enzymes. The structure of the E. coli enzyme suggests that a common ancestor of the two enzyme subfamilies may have included an Fe-S cluster.</p>

<p>Glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase from Escherichia coli exhibits a basal PRPP-independent glutaminase activity having a kcat/Km that is 0.3% of fully active enzyme. Binding of PRPP activates the enzyme by a structural change that lowers the Km for glutamine 100-fold and couples glutamine hydrolysis to synthesis of 5-phosphoribosylamine. By analysis of the x-ray structure of the glutamine site containing bound 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine, a glutamine affinity analog, and by site-directed mutagenesis we have identified residues important for glutamine binding, catalysis, and coupling with PRPP. Tyr74 is a key residue in the coupling between the sites for glutamine in the NH2-terminal domain and PRPP in the COOH-terminal domain. Arg73 and Asp127 have roles in glutamine binding. The x-ray structure indicates that there are no amino acid side chains sufficiently close to Cys1 to participate as a proton acceptor in formation of the thiolate needed for nucleophilic attack on the carboxamide of glutamine, nor as a general acid for amide nitrogen transfer. Based on the x-ray model of the glutamine site and analysis of a mutant enzyme we propose that the free NH2 terminus of Cys1 functions as the proton acceptor and donor. The results indicate that the side chain of Asn101 and the backbone nitrogen of Gly102 function to stabilize a tetrahedral oxyanion resulting from attack of Cys1 on the glutamine carboxamide. Cys1, Arg73, Asn101, Gly102, and Asp127 are conserved in the NH2-terminal domain of a subfamily of amidotransferases that includes asparagine synthetase, glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase, and glutamate synthase, implying a common function in the four enzymes. Tyr74, on the other hand, is conserved only in glutamine PRPP amidotransferase sequences consistent with a specific role in interdomain coupling. The catalytic framework of key glutamine site residues supports the assignment of glutamine PRPP amidotransferase to a recently described Ntn (NH2-terminal nucleophile) hydrolase family of enzymes.</p>

<p>Double trouble: A hybrid organic-inorganic (organometallic) inhibitor was designed to target glutathione transferases. The metal center is used to direct protein binding, while the organic moiety acts as the active-site inhibitor (see picture). The mechanism of inhibition was studied using a range of biophysical and biochemical methods.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase has been solved with bound effector, l-serine, and substrate, hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate, at resolutions of 2.7 and 2.4 A, respectively. The subunits display the same extreme asymmetry as seen in the apo-structure and provide insight into the mode of serine binding and closure of the active site. Mutagenesis studies confirm the identity of the main residues involved in serine binding and suggest that the poly glycine stretch in the loop that contains the locus for the 160 degrees rotation that leads to subunit asymmetry may have a larger role in folding than in catalysis. The lack of electron density for the cofactor, NADH, in any of the crystals examined led us to study binding by stopped flow kinetic analysis. The kinetic data suggest that productive NADH binding, that would support catalytic turnover, is dependent on the presence of substrate. This observation, along with the binding of substrate in the active site, but in an unproductive conformation, suggests a possible mechanism where initial binding of substrate leads to enhanced interaction with cofactor accompanied by a rearrangement of catalytically critical residue side chains. Furthermore, comparison to the structure of a truncated form of human d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase with cofactor and a substrate analog, provides insight into the conformational changes that occur during catalysis.</p>

<p>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of the structural basis of glycosyl transfer. Yet the nature and relevance of the conformational changes associated with substrate recognition and catalysis remain poorly understood. We have focused on the glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (GpgS), a "retaining" enzyme, that initiates the biosynthetic pathway of methylglucose lipopolysaccharides in mycobacteria. Evidence is provided that GpgS displays an unusually broad metal ion specificity for a GT-A enzyme, with Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Ca(2+), Co(2+), and Fe(2+) assisting catalysis. In the crystal structure of the apo-form of GpgS, we have observed that a flexible loop adopts a double conformation L(A) and L(I) in the active site of both monomers of the protein dimer. Notably, the L(A) loop geometry corresponds to an active conformation and is conserved in two other relevant states of the enzyme, namely the GpgS·metal·nucleotide sugar donor and the GpgS·metal·nucleotide·acceptor-bound complexes, indicating that GpgS is intrinsically in a catalytically active conformation. The crystal structure of GpgS in the presence of Mn(2+)·UDP·phosphoglyceric acid revealed an alternate conformation for the nucleotide sugar β-phosphate, which likely occurs upon sugar transfer. Structural, biochemical, and biophysical data point to a crucial role of the β-phosphate in donor and acceptor substrate binding and catalysis. Altogether, our experimental data suggest a model wherein the catalytic site is essentially preformed, with a few conformational changes of lateral chain residues as the protein proceeds along the catalytic cycle. This model of action may be applicable to a broad range of GT-A glycosyltransferases.</p>

<p>In fragment-based drug discovery, the weak affinities exhibited by fragments pose significant challenges for screening. Biophysical techniques are used to address this challenge, but there is no clear consensus on which cascade of methods is best suited to identify fragment hits that ultimately translate into bound X-ray structures and provide bona fide starting points for synthesis. We have benchmarked an integrated biophysical approach for fragment screening and validation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis pantothenate synthetase. A primary screen of 1,250 fragments library was performed by thermal shift, followed by secondary screen using one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (water ligand observed gradient spectroscopy and saturation transfer difference binding experiments) and ultimate hit validation by isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography. Our multibiophysical approach identified three distinct binding sites for fragments and laid a solid foundation for successful structure-based elaboration into potent inhibitors. </p>

<p>The three-dimensional structure of rat-liver acyl-CoA oxidase-II (ACO-II) in a complex with a C12-fatty acid was solved by the molecular replacement method based on the uncomplexed ACO-II structure. The crystalline form of the complex was obtained by cocrystallization of ACO-II with dodecanoyl-CoA. The crystalline complex possessed, in the active-site crevice, only the fatty acid moiety that had been formed through hydrolysis of the thioester bond. The overall dimeric structure and the folding pattern of each subunit are essentially superimposable on those of uncomplexed ACO-II. The active site including the flavin ring of FAD, the crevice embracing the fatty acyl moiety, and adjacent amino acid side chains are superimposably conserved with the exception of Glu421, whose carboxylate group is tilted away to accommodate the fatty acid. One of the carboxyl oxygens of the bound fatty acid is hydrogen-bonded to the amide hydrogen of Glu421, the presumed catalytic base, and to the ribityl 2'-hydroxyl group of FAD. This hydrogen-bonding network correlates well with the substrate recognition/activation in acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The binding mode of C12-fatty acid suggests that the active site does not close upon substrate binding, but remains spacious during the entire catalytic process, the oxygen accessibility in the oxidative half-reaction thereby being maintained.</p>

<p>The pdxK and pdxY genes have been found to code for pyridoxal kinases, enzymes involved in the pyridoxal phosphate salvage pathway. Two pyridoxal kinase structures have recently been published, including Escherichia coli pyridoxal kinase 2 (ePL kinase 2) and sheep pyridoxal kinase, products of the pdxY and pdxK genes, respectively. We now report the crystal structure of E. coli pyridoxal kinase 1 (ePL kinase 1), encoded by a pdxK gene, and an isoform of ePL kinase 2. The structures were determined in the unliganded and binary complexes with either MgATP or pyridoxal to 2.1-, 2.6-, and 3.2-A resolutions, respectively. The active site of ePL kinase 1 does not show significant conformational change upon binding of either pyridoxal or MgATP. Like sheep PL kinase, ePL kinase 1 exhibits a sequential random mechanism. Unlike sheep pyridoxal kinase, ePL kinase 1 may not tolerate wide variation in the size and chemical nature of the 4' substituent on the substrate. This is the result of differences in a key residue at position 59 on a loop (loop II) that partially forms the active site. Residue 59, which is His in ePL kinase 1, interacts with the formyl group at C-4' of pyridoxal and may also determine if residues from another loop (loop I) can fill the active site in the absence of the substrate. Both loop I and loop II are suggested to play significant roles in the functions of PL kinases.</p>

<p>Key binding interactions of the anthranilimide based glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa) inhibitor 2 from X-ray crystallography studies are described. This series of compounds bind to the AMP site of GP. Using the binding information the core and the phenyl urea moieties were optimized. This work culminated in the identification of compounds with single nanomolar potency as well as in vivo efficacy in a diabetic model.</p>

<p>HIV-1 protease is a dimeric aspartic protease that plays an essential role in viral replication. To further understand the catalytic mechanism and inhibitor recognition of HIV-1 protease, we need to determine the locations of key hydrogen atoms in the catalytic aspartates Asp-25 and Asp-125. The structure of HIV-1 protease in complex with transition-state analog KNI-272 was determined by combined neutron crystallography at 1.9-A resolution and X-ray crystallography at 1.4-A resolution. The resulting structural data show that the catalytic residue Asp-25 is protonated and that Asp-125 (the catalytic residue from the corresponding diad-related molecule) is deprotonated. The proton on Asp-25 makes a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the allophenylnorstatine (Apns) group in KNI-272. The deprotonated Asp-125 bonds to the hydroxyl proton of Apns. The results provide direct experimental evidence for proposed aspects of the catalytic mechanism of HIV-1 protease and can therefore contribute substantially to the development of specific inhibitors for therapeutic application.</p>

<p>Atazanavir, which is marketed as REYATAZ, is the first human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor approved for once-daily administration. As previously reported, atazanavir offers improved inhibitory profiles against several common variants of HIV-1 protease over those of the other peptidomimetic inhibitors currently on the market. This work describes the X-ray crystal structures of complexes of atazanavir with two HIV-1 protease variants, namely, (i) an enzyme optimized for resistance to autolysis and oxidation, referred to as the cleavage-resistant mutant (CRM); and (ii) the M46I/V82F/I84V/L90M mutant of the CRM enzyme, which is resistant to all approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors, referred to as the inhibitor-resistant mutant. In these two complexes, atazanavir adopts distinct bound conformations in response to the V82F substitution, which may explain why this substitution, at least in isolation, has yet to be selected in vitro or in the clinic. Because of its nearly symmetrical chemical structure, atazanavir is able to make several analogous contacts with each monomer of the biological dimer.</p>

<p>Novel nonpeptidic inhibitors of beta-secretase (BACE1) have been discovered by employing a fragment-based biochemical screening approach. A diverse library of 20000 low-molecular weight compounds were screened and yielded 26 novel hits that were confirmed by biochemical and surface plasmon resonance secondary assays. We describe here fragment inhibitors cocrystallized with BACE1 in a flap open and flap closed conformation as determined by X-ray crystallography.</p>

<p>Strain is eliminated as a factor in hydrolysis of the scissile peptide bond by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), based on the first eight complexes of products of hydrolysis with the enzymes. The carboxyl group generated at the scissile bond interacts with both catalytic aspartic acids. The structures directly suggest the interactions of the gemdiol intermediate with the active site. Based on the structures, the nucleophilic water is displaced stereospecifically by substrate binding toward one catalytic aspartic acid, while the scissile carbonyl becomes hydrogen bonded to the other catalytic aspartic acid in position for hydrolysis. Crystal structures for two N-terminal (P) products and two C-terminal (Q) products provide unambiguous density for the ligands at 2.2-2.6 A resolution and 17-21% R factors. The N-terminal product, Ac-S-L-N-F/, overlaps closely with the N-terminal sequences of peptidomimetic inhibitors bound to the protease. Comparison of the two C-terminal products, /F-L-E-K and /F(NO2)-E-A-Nle-S, indicates that the P2' residue is highly constrained, while the positioning of the P1' and P3' residues are sequence dependent.</p>

<p>We have determined the first structure of a family 31 alpha-glycosidase, that of YicI from Escherichia coli, both free and trapped as a 5-fluoroxylopyranosyl-enzyme intermediate via reaction with 5-fluoro-alpha-D-xylopyranosyl fluoride. Our 2.2-A resolution structure shows an intimately associated hexamer with structural elements from several monomers converging at each of the six active sites. Our kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses verified several of the features observed in our structural data, including a covalent linkage from the carboxylate side chain of the identified nucleophile Asp(416) to C-1 of the sugar ring. Structure-based sequence comparison of YicI with the mammalian alpha-glucosidases lysosomal alpha-glucosidase and sucrase-isomaltase predicts a high level of structural similarity and provides a foundation for understanding the various mutations of these enzymes that elicit human disease.</p>

<p>The J-binding protein 1 (JBP1) is essential for biosynthesis and maintenance of DNA base-J (β-d-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil). Base-J and JBP1 are confined to some pathogenic protozoa and are absent from higher eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses. We show that JBP1 recognizes J-containing DNA (J-DNA) through a 160-residue domain, DB-JBP1, with 10 000-fold preference over normal DNA. The crystal structure of DB-JBP1 revealed a helix-turn-helix variant fold, a 'helical bouquet' with a 'ribbon' helix encompassing the amino acids responsible for DNA binding. Mutation of a single residue (Asp525) in the ribbon helix abrogates specificity toward J-DNA. The same mutation renders JBP1 unable to rescue the targeted deletion of endogenous JBP1 genes in Leishmania and changes its distribution in the nucleus. Based on mutational analysis and hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass-spectrometry data, a model of JBP1 bound to J-DNA was constructed and validated by small-angle X-ray scattering data. Our results open new possibilities for targeted prevention of J-DNA recognition as a therapeutic intervention for parasitic diseases.</p>

<p>The molecular interactions between the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and two compound classes consisting of N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]benzenesulfonamides and N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]benzenemethanesulfonamides have been investigated using organic synthesis, enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography, and thermodynamic profiling. The inhibitors' aromatic properties were varied to establish structure-activity relationships (SAR) between the inhibitors and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The two structurally similar compound classes proved to have distinctly divergent SARs in terms of their inhibition capacity of AChE. Eight X-ray structures revealed that the two sets have different conformations in PAS. Furthermore, thermodynamic profiles of the binding between compounds and AChE revealed class-dependent differences of the entropy/enthalpy contributions to the free energy of binding. Further development of the entropy-favored compound class resulted in the synthesis of the most potent inhibitor and an extension beyond the established SARs. The divergent SARs will be utilized to develop reversible inhibitors of AChE into reactivators of nerve agent-inhibited AChE. </p>

<p>HIV-1 protease (PR) is the target for several important antiviral drugs used in AIDS therapy. The drugs bind inside the active site cavity of PR where normally the viral polyprotein substrate is bound and hydrolyzed. We report two high-resolution crystal structures of wild-type PR (PRWT) and the multi-drug-resistant variant with the I54V mutation (PRI54V) in complex with a peptide at 1.46 and 1.50 A resolution, respectively. The peptide forms a gem-diol tetrahedral reaction intermediate (TI) in the crystal structures. Distinctive interactions are observed for the TI binding in the active site cavity of PRWT and PRI54V. The mutant PRI54V/TI complex has lost water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions with the amides of Ile50 and Ile50' in the flap. Hence, the structures provide insight into the mechanism of drug resistance arising from this mutation. The structures also illustrate an intermediate state in the hydrolysis reaction. One of the gem-diol hydroxide groups in the PRWT complex forms a very short (2.3 A) hydrogen bond with the outer carboxylate oxygen of Asp25. Quantum chemical calculations based on this TI structure are consistent with protonation of the inner carboxylate oxygen of Asp25', in contrast to several theoretical studies. These TI complexes and quantum calculations are discussed in relation to the chemical mechanism of the peptide bond hydrolysis catalyzed by PR.</p>

<p>The molecular interactions between the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and two compound classes consisting of N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]benzenesulfonamides and N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]benzenemethanesulfonamides have been investigated using organic synthesis, enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography, and thermodynamic profiling. The inhibitors' aromatic properties were varied to establish structure-activity relationships (SAR) between the inhibitors and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The two structurally similar compound classes proved to have distinctly divergent SARs in terms of their inhibition capacity of AChE. Eight X-ray structures revealed that the two sets have different conformations in PAS. Furthermore, thermodynamic profiles of the binding between compounds and AChE revealed class-dependent differences of the entropy/enthalpy contributions to the free energy of binding. Further development of the entropy-favored compound class resulted in the synthesis of the most potent inhibitor and an extension beyond the established SARs. The divergent SARs will be utilized to develop reversible inhibitors of AChE into reactivators of nerve agent-inhibited AChE. </p>

<p>Glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GART; 10-formyltetrahydrofolate:5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase, EC 2.1.2.2), an essential enzyme in de novo purine biosynthesis, has been a chemotherapeutic target for several decades. The three-dimensional structure of the GART domain from the human trifunctional enzyme has been solved by X-ray crystallography. Models of the apoenzyme, and a ternary complex with the 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate cosubstrate and a glycinamide ribonucleotide analogue, hydroxyacetamide ribonucleotide [alpha,beta-N-(hydroxyacetyl)-d-ribofuranosylamine], are reported to 2.2 and 2.07 A, respectively. The model of the apoenzyme represents the first structure of GART, from any source, with a completely unoccupied substrate and cosubstrate site, while the ternary complex is the first structure of the human GART domain that is bound at both the substrate and cosubstrate sites. A comparison of the two models therefore reveals subtle structural differences that reflect substrate and cosubstrate binding effects and implies roles for the invariant residues Gly 133, Gly 146, and His 137. Preactivation of the DDF formyl group appears to be key for catalysis, and structural flexibility of the active end of the substrate may facilitate nucleophilic attack. A change in pH, rather than folate binding, correlates with movement of the folate binding loop, whereas the phosphate binding loop position does not vary with pH. The electrostatic surface potentials of the human GART domain and Escherichia coli enzyme explain differences in the binding affinity of polyglutamylated folates, and these differences have implications to future chemotherapeutic agent design.</p>

<p>Two new X-ray structures of an HIV-1 protease mutant (A71V, V82T, I84V) in complex with inhibitors SE and SQ, pseudotetrapeptide inhibitors with an acyclic S-hydroxyethylamine isostere, were determined. Comparison of eight structures exploring the binding of four similar inhibitors--SE, SQ (S-hydroxyethylamine isostere), OE (ethyleneamine), and QF34 (hydroxyethylene)--to wild-type and A71V/V82T/I84V HIV-1 protease elucidates the principles of altered interaction with changing conditions. The A71V mutation, which is distant from the active site, causes changes in the structure of the enzyme detectable by the means of X-ray structure analysis, and a route of propagation of the effect toward the active site is proposed.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous FIC domain is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to human and has been shown to catalyze AMP transfer onto protein side-chain hydroxyl groups. Recently, it was predicted that most catalytically competent Fic proteins are inhibited by the presence of an inhibitory helix αinh that is provided by a cognate anti-toxin (class I), or is part of the N- or C-terminal part of the Fic protein itself (classes II and III). In vitro, inhibition is relieved by mutation of a conserved glutamate of αinh to glycine. For the class III bacterial Fic protein NmFic from Neisseria meningitidis, the inhibitory mechanism has been elucidated. Here, we extend above study by including bacterial class I and II Fic proteins VbhT from Bartonella schoenbuchensis and SoFic from Shewanella oneidensis, respectively, and the respective E-&gt;G mutants. Comparative enzymatic and crystallographic analyses show that, in all three classes, the ATP substrate binds to the wild-type FIC domains, but with the α-phosphate in disparate and non-competent orientations. In the E-&gt;G mutants, however, the tri-phosphate moiety is found reorganized to the same tightly bound structure through a unique set of hydrogen bonds with Fic signature motif residues. The γ-phosphate adopts the location that is taken by the inhibitory glutamate in wild-type resulting in an α-phosphate orientation that can be attacked in-line by a target side-chain hydroxyl group. The latter is properly registered to the Fic active center by main-chain β-interactions with the β-hairpin flap. These data indicate that the active site motif and the exposed edge of the flap are both required to form an adenylylation-competent Fic protein.</p>

<p>Because nickel is both essential and toxic to a great variety of organisms, its detection and transport is highly regulated. In Escherichia coli and other related Gram-negative bacteria, high affinity nickel transport depends on proteins expressed by the nik operon. A central actor of this process is the periplasmic NikA transport protein. A previous structural report has proposed that nickel binds to NikA as a pentahydrate species. However, both stereochemical considerations and X-ray absorption spectroscopic results are incompatible with that interpretation. Here, we report the 1.8 A resolution structure of NikA and show that it binds FeEDTA(H2O)- with very high affinity. In addition, we provide crystallographic evidence that a metal-EDTA complex was also bound to the previously reported NikA structure. Our observations strongly suggest that nickel transport in E. coli requires the binding of this metal ion to a metallophore that bears significant resemblance to EDTA. They also provide a basis for the potential use of NikA in the bioremediation of toxic transition metals and the design of artificial metalloenzymes.</p>

<p>Tris-dipicolinate lanthanide complexes were used to prepare derivative crystals of six proteins: hen egg-white lysozyme, turkey egg-white lysozyme, thaumatin from Thaumatococcus daniellii, urate oxidase from Aspergillus flavus, porcine pancreatic elastase and xylanase from Trichoderma reesei. Diffraction data were collected using either synchrotron radiation or X-rays from a laboratory source. In all cases, the complex turned out to be bound to the protein and the phases determined using the anomalous scattering of the lanthanide led to high-quality electron-density maps. The binding mode of the complex was characterized from the refined structures. The lanthanide tris-dipicolinate was found to bind through interactions between carboxylate groups of the dipicolinate ligands and hydrogen-bond donor groups of the protein. In each binding site, one enantiomeric form of the complex is selected from the racemic solution according to the specific site topology. For hen egg-white lysozyme and xylanase, derivative crystals obtained by cocrystallization belonged to a new monoclinic C2 crystal form that diffracted to high resolution.</p>

<p>3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P) is the phosphorylated precursor of KDO, an essential sugar of the lipopolysaccharide of Gram negative bacteria. KDO8P is produced by a specific synthase (KDO8PS) by condensing arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), with release of inorganic phosphate. As KDO8PS is present in bacteria and plants, but not in mammalian cells, and mutations that inactivate KDO8PS also block cell replication, KDO8PS is a promising target for the design of new antimicrobials that act by blocking lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that a compound mimicking an intermediate of the condensation reaction is a good ligand and a powerful inhibitor. Here we report on the crystallographic investigation of the binding to KDO8PS of new derivatives of this original inhibitor. The structures of the enzyme in complex with these compounds, and also with the PEP analogs, 2-phosphoglyceric acid (2-PGA) and Z-methyl-PEP, point to future strategies for the design of novel inhibitors of KDO8PS.</p>

<p>The relationship between the structures of protein-ligand complexes existing in the crystal and in solution, essential in the case of fragment-based screening by X-ray crystallography (FBS-X), has been often an object of controversy. To address this question, simultaneous co-crystallization and soaking of two inhibitors with different ratios, Fidarestat (FID; K(d) = 6.5 nM) and IDD594 (594; K(d) = 61 nM), which bind to h-aldose reductase (AR), have been performed. The subatomic resolution of the crystal structures allows the differentiation of both inhibitors, even when the structures are almost superposed. We have determined the occupation ratio in solution by mass spectrometry (MS) Occ(FID)/Occ(594) = 2.7 and by X-ray crystallography Occ(FID)/Occ(594) = 0.6. The occupancies in the crystal and in solution differ 4.6 times, implying that ligand binding potency is influenced by crystal contacts. A structural analysis shows that the Loop A (residues 122-130), which is exposed to the solvent, is flexible in solution, and is involved in packing contacts within the crystal. Furthermore, inhibitor 594 contacts the base of Loop A, stabilizing it, while inhibitor FID does not. This is shown by the difference in B-factors of the Loop A between the AR-594 and AR-FID complexes. A stable loop diminishes the entropic energy barrier to binding, favoring 594 versus FID. Therefore, the effect of the crystal environment should be taken into consideration in the X-ray diffraction analysis of ligand binding to proteins. This conclusion highlights the need for additional methodologies in the case of FBS-X to validate this powerful screening technique, which is widely used.</p>

<p>The coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent aerobic benzoate metabolic pathway uses an unprecedented chemical strategy to overcome the high aromatic resonance energy by forming the non-aromatic 2,3-epoxybenzoyl-CoA. The crucial dearomatizing reaction is catalyzed by three enzymes, BoxABC, where BoxA is an NADPH-dependent reductase, BoxB is a benzoyl-CoA 2,3-epoxidase, and BoxC is an epoxide ring hydrolase. We characterized the key enzyme BoxB from Azoarcus evansii by structural and Mössbauer spectroscopic methods as a new member of class I diiron enzymes. Several family members were structurally studied with respect to the diiron center architecture, but no structure of an intact diiron enzyme with its natural substrate has been reported. X-ray structures between 1.9 and 2.5 Å resolution were determined for BoxB in the diferric state and with bound substrate benzoyl-CoA in the reduced state. The substrate-bound reduced state is distinguished from the diferric state by increased iron-ligand distances and the absence of directly bridging groups between them. The position of benzoyl-CoA inside a 20 Å long channel and the position of the phenyl ring relative to the diiron center are accurately defined. The C2 and C3 atoms of the phenyl ring are closer to one of the irons. Therefore, one oxygen of activated O(2) must be ligated predominantly to this proximate iron to be in a geometrically suitable position to attack the phenyl ring. Consistent with the observed iron/phenyl geometry, BoxB stereoselectively should form the 2S,3R-epoxide. We postulate a reaction cycle that allows a charge delocalization because of the phenyl ring and the electron-withdrawing CoA thioester.</p>

<p>The 3C-like main peptidase 3CL(pro) is a viral polyprotein processing enzyme essential for the viability of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). While it is generalized that 3CL(pro) and the structurally related 3C(pro) viral peptidases cleave their substrates via a mechanism similar to that underlying the peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (CLSPs), some of the hypothesized key intermediates have not been structurally characterized. Here, we present three crystal structures of SARS 3CL(pro) in complex with each of two members of a new class of peptide-based phthalhydrazide inhibitors. Both inhibitors form an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of Cys145, trapping the enzyme's catalytic residues in configurations similar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis of native substrates. Most significantly, our crystallographic data are consistent with a scenario in which a water molecule, possibly via indirect coordination from the carbonyl oxygen of Thr26, has initiated nucleophilic attack on the enzyme-bound inhibitor. Our data suggest that this structure resembles that of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate during the deacylation step of normal peptidyl cleavage.</p>

<p>Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium can utilize acetate as the sole source of carbon and energy. Acetate kinase (AckA) and phosphotransacetylase (Pta), key enzymes of acetate utilization pathway, regulate flux of metabolites in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, glyoxylate bypass and fatty acid metabolism.</p>

<p>Heavy metal P1B-type ATPases play a critical role in cell survival by maintaining appropriate intracellular metal concentrations. Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopB is a member of this family that transports Cu(II) from the cytoplasm to the exterior of the cell using ATP as energy source. CopB has a 264 amino acid ATPBD (ATP-binding domain) that is essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis as well as ultimately transducing the energy to the transmembrane metal-binding site for metal occlusion and export. The relevant conformations of this domain during the different steps of the catalytic cycle are still under discussion. Through crystal structures of the apo- and phosphate-bound ATPBDs, with limited proteolysis and fluorescence studies of the apo- and substrate-bound states, we show that the isolated ATPBD of CopB cycles from an open conformation in the apo-state to a closed conformation in the substrate-bound state, then returns to an open conformation suitable for product release. The present work is the first structural report of an ATPBD with its physiologically relevant product (phosphate) bound. The solution studies we have performed help resolve questions on the potential influence of crystal packing on domain conformation. These results explain how phosphate is co-ordinated in ATPase transporters and give an insight into the physiologically relevant conformation of the ATPBD at different steps of the catalytic cycle.</p>

<p>The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a variety of virulence factors including pyoverdine, a nonribosomally produced peptide siderophore. The maturation pathway of the pyoverdine peptide is complex and provides a unique target for inhibition. Within the pyoverdine biosynthetic cluster is a periplasmic hydrolase, PvdQ, that is required for pyoverdine production. However, the precise role of PvdQ in the maturation pathway has not been biochemically characterized. We demonstrate herein that the initial module of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase PvdL adds a myristate moiety to the pyoverdine precursor. We extracted this acylated precursor, called PVDIq, from a pvdQ mutant strain and show that the PvdQ enzyme removes the fatty acid catalyzing one of the final steps in pyoverdine maturation. Incubation of PVDIq with crystals of PvdQ allowed us to capture the acylated enzyme and confirm through structural studies the chemical composition of the incorporated acyl chain. Finally, because inhibition of siderophore synthesis has been identified as a potential antibiotic strategy, we developed a high-throughput screening assay and tested a small chemical library for compounds that inhibit PvdQ activity. Two compounds that block PvdQ have been identified, and their binding within the fatty acid binding pocket was structurally characterized.</p>

<p>The microbial degradation of the plant cell wall is a pivotal biological process that is of increasing industrial significance. One of the major plant structural polysaccharides is mannan, a beta-1,4-linked d-mannose polymer, which is hydrolyzed by endo- and exo-acting mannanases. The mechanisms by which the exo-acting enzymes target the chain ends of mannan and how galactose decorations influence activity are poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure and biochemical properties of CjMan26C, a Cellvibrio japonicus GH26 mannanase. The exo-acting enzyme releases the disaccharide mannobiose from the nonreducing end of mannan and mannooligosaccharides, harnessing four mannose-binding subsites extending from -2 to +2. The structure of CjMan26C is very similar to that of the endo-acting C. japonicus mannanase CjMan26A. The exo-activity displayed by CjMan26C, however, reflects a subtle change in surface topography in which a four-residue extension of surface loop creates a steric block at the distal glycone -2 subsite. endo-Activity can be introduced into enzyme variants through truncation of an aspartate side chain, a component of a surface loop, or by removing both the aspartate and its flanking residues. The structure of catalytically competent CjMan26C, in complex with a decorated manno-oligosaccharide, reveals a predominantly unhydrolyzed substrate in an approximate (1)S(5) conformation. The complex structure helps to explain how the substrate "side chain" decorations greatly reduce the activity of the enzyme; the galactose side chain at the -1 subsite makes polar interactions with the aglycone mannose, possibly leading to suboptimal binding and impaired leaving group departure. This report reveals how subtle differences in the loops surrounding the active site of a glycoside hydrolase can lead to a change in the mode of action of the enzyme.</p>

<p>Enzymes achieve their catalytic proficiency by precisely positioning the substrate and catalytic residues with respect to each other. Atomic resolution crystallography is an excellent tool to study the important details of these geometric active-site features. Here, we have investigated the reaction mechanism of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) using atomic resolution crystallographic studies at 0.82-A resolution of leishmanial TIM complexed with the well-studied reaction-intermediate analog phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH). Remaining unresolved aspects of the reaction mechanism of TIM such as the protonation state of the first reaction intermediate and the properties of the hydrogen-bonding interactions in the active site are being addressed. The hydroxamate moiety of PGH interacts via unusually short hydrogen bonds of its N1-O1 moiety with the carboxylate group of the catalytic glutamate (Glu167), for example, the distance of N1(PGH)-OE2(Glu167) is 2.69 +/- 0.01 A and the distance of O1(PGH)-OE1(Glu167) is 2.60 +/- 0.01 A. Structural comparisons show that the side chain of the catalytic base (Glu167) can move during the reaction cycle in a small cavity, located above the hydroxamate plane. The structure analysis suggests that the hydroxamate moiety of PGH is negatively charged. Therefore, the bound PGH mimics the negatively charged enediolate intermediate, which is formed immediately after the initial proton abstraction from DHAP by the catalytic glutamate. The new findings are discussed in the context of the current knowledge of the TIM reaction mechanism.</p>

<p>Human H ferritin (HuHF) assembles from 24 four-helix bundles to form an approximately 500 kDa protein with an 8 nm internal cavity. HuHF provides a useful model for studying the transport of metal ions in solution to buried reaction sites in proteins. In this study, HuHF was redesigned to facilitate noble metal ion (Au(3+), Ag(+)) binding, reduction, and nanoparticle formation within the cavity. Computationally determined amino acid substitutions were targeted at four external and four internal surface sites. A variant with a total of 96 cysteines and histidines removed from the exterior surface and 96 non-native cysteines added to the interior surface retained wild-type stability and structure, as confirmed by X-ray crystallography, and promoted the formation of silver or gold nanoparticles within the protein cavity. Crystallographic studies with HuHF variants provide insight into how ferritins control access of metal ions to interior residues that perform chemistry.</p>

<p>In order to further explore the tolerance of proteins to amino acid substitutions within the interior, a series of core residues was replaced by methionine within the C-terminal domain of T4 lysozyme. By replacing leucine, isoleucine, valine and phenylalanine residues a total of 10 methionines could be introduced, which corresponds to a third of the residues that are buried in this domain. As more methionines are incorporated the protein gradually loses stability. This is attributed in part to a reduction in hydrophobic stabilization, in part to the increased entropic cost of localizing the long, flexible methionine sidechains, and in part to steric clashes. The changes in structure of the mutants relative to the wildtype protein are modest but tend to increase in an additive fashion as more methionines are included. In the most extreme case, namely the 10-methionine mutant, much of the C-terminal domain remains quite similar to wildtype (root-mean-square backbone shifts of 0.56 A), while the F and G helices undergo rotations of approximately 20 degrees and center-of-mass shifts of approximately 1.4 A. For up to six methionine substitutions the changes in stability are additive. Beyond this point, however, the multiple mutants are somewhat more stable than suggested from the sum of their constituents, especially for those including the replacement Val111--&gt;Met. This is interpreted in terms of the larger structural changes associated with this substitution. The substituted sidechains in the mutant structures have somewhat higher crystallographic thermal factors than their counterparts in WT*. Nevertheless, the interiors of the mutant proteins retain a well-defined structure with little suggestion of molten-globule characteristics. Lysozymes in which selenomethionine has been incorporated rather than methionine tend to have increased stability. At the same time they also fold faster. This provides further evidence that, at the rate-limiting step in folding, the structure of the C-terminal domain of T4 lysozyme is similar to that of the fully folded protein.</p>

<p>Abasic sites represent the most frequent DNA lesions in the genome that have high mutagenic potential and lead to mutations commonly found in human cancers. Although these lesions are devoid of the genetic information, adenine is most efficiently inserted when abasic sites are bypassed by DNA polymerases, a phenomenon termed A-rule. In this study, we present X-ray structures of a DNA polymerase caught while incorporating a nucleotide opposite an abasic site. We found that a functionally important tyrosine side chain directs for nucleotide incorporation rather than DNA. It fills the vacant space of the absent template nucleobase and thereby mimics a pyrimidine nucleobase directing for preferential purine incorporation opposite abasic residues because of enhanced geometric fit to the active site. This amino acid templating mechanism was corroborated by switching to pyrimidine specificity because of mutation of the templating tyrosine into tryptophan. The tyrosine is located in motif B and highly conserved throughout evolution from bacteria to humans indicating a general amino acid templating mechanism for bypass of non-instructive lesions by DNA polymerases at least from this sequence family.</p>

<p>L-Threonine acetaldehyde-lyase (threonine aldolase, TA) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzyme that catalyzes conversion of L-threonine or L-allo-threonine to glycine and acetaldehyde in a secondary glycine biosynthetic pathway. X-ray structures of Thermatoga maritima TA have been determined as the apo-enzyme at 1.8 A resolution and bound to substrate L-allo-threonine and product glycine at 1.9 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively. Despite low pairwise sequence identities, TA is a member of aspartate aminotransferase (AATase) fold family of PLP enzymes. The enzyme forms a 222 homotetramer with the PLP cofactor bound via a Schiff-base linkage to Lys199 within a domain interface. The structure reveals bound calcium and chloride ions that appear to contribute to catalysis and oligomerization, respectively. Although L-threonine and L-allo-threonine are substrates for T. maritima TA, enzymatic assays revealed a strong preference for L-allo-threonine. Structures of the external aldimines with substrate/product reveal a pair of histidines that may provide flexibility in substrate recognition. Variation in the threonine binding pocket may explain preferences for L-allo-threonine versus L-threonine among TA family members.</p>

<p>Propionate metabolism in Salmonella typhimurium occurs via 2-methylcitric acid cycle. The last step of this cycle, the cleavage of 2-methylisocitrate to succinate and pyruvate, is catalysed by 2-methylisocitrate lyase (PrpB). Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the native and the pyruvate/Mg(2+) bound PrpB from S. typhimurium, determined at 2.1 and 2.3A, respectively. The structure closely resembles that of the Escherichia coli enzyme. Unlike the E. coli PrpB, Mg(2+) could not be located in the native Salmonella PrpB. Only in pyruvate bound PrpB structure, Mg(2+) was found coordinated with pyruvate. Binding of pyruvate to PrpB seems to induce movement of the Mg(2+) by 2.5A from its position found in E. coli native PrpB. In both the native enzyme and pyruvate/Mg(2+) bound forms, the active site loop is completely disordered. Examination of the pocket in which pyruvate and glyoxalate bind to 2-methylisocitrate lyase and isocitrate lyase, respectively, reveals plausible rationale for different substrate specificities of these two enzymes. Structural similarities in substrate and metal atom binding site as well as presence of similar residues in the active site suggest possible similarities in the reaction mechanism.</p>

<p>Following the discovery of 4-(substituted amino)-1-alkyl-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-carboxamides as potent and selective phosphodiesterase 4B inhibitors, [Hamblin, J. N.; Angell, T.; Ballentine, S., et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.2008, 18, 4237] the SAR of the 5-position was investigated further. A range of substituted heterocycles showed good potencies against PDE4. Optimisation using X-ray crystallography and computational modelling led to the discovery of 16, with sub-nM inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α production from isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>

<p>Triose-phosphate isomerase, a key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, catalyzes the isomerization of dihydroxy acetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. In this communication we report the crystal structure of Plasmodium falciparum triose-phosphate isomerase complexed to the inhibitor 2-phosphoglycerate at 1.1-A resolution. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a dimeric molecule. The inhibitor bound to one of the subunits in which the flexible catalytic loop 6 is in the open conformation has been cleaved into two fragments presumably due to radiation damage. The cleavage products have been tentatively identified as 2-oxoglycerate and meta-phosphate. The intact 2-phosphoglycerate bound to the active site of the other subunit has been observed in two different orientations. The active site loop in this subunit is in both open and "closed" conformations, although the open form is predominant. Concomitant with the loop closure, Phe-96, Leu-167, and residues 208-211 (YGGS) are also observed in dual conformations in the B-subunit. Detailed comparison of the active-site geometry in the present case to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae triose-phosphate isomerase-dihydroxy acetone phosphate and Leishmania mexicana triose-phosphate isomerase-phosphoglycolate complexes, which have also been determined at atomic resolution, shows that certain interactions are common to the three structures, although 2-phosphoglycerate is neither a substrate nor a transition state analogue.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the ribosome inhibiting protein Mistletoe Lectin I (ML-I) derived from the European mistletoe, Viscum album, in complex with kinetin has been refined at 2.7Å resolution. Suitably large crystals of ML-I were obtained applying the counter diffusion method using the Gel Tube R Crystallization Kit (GT-R) on board the Russian Service Module on the international space station ISS within the GCF mission No. 6, arranged by the Japanese aerospace exploration agency (JAXA). Hexagonal bi-pyramidal crystals were grown during three months under microgravity. Before data collection the crystals were soaked in a saturated solution of kinetin and diffraction data to 2.7Å were collected using synchrotron radiation and cryogenic techniques. The atomic model was refined and revealed a single kinetin molecule in the ribosome inactivation site of ML-I. The complex demonstrates the feasibility of mistletoe to bind plant hormones out of the host regulation system as part of a self protection mechanism.</p>

<p>The targets of the Structural GenomiX (SGX) bacterial genomics project were proteins conserved in multiple prokaryotic organisms with no obvious sequence homolog in the Protein Data Bank of known structures. The outcome of this work was 80 structures, covering 60 unique sequences and 49 different genes. Experimental phase determination from proteins incorporating Se-Met was carried out for 45 structures with most of the remainder solved by molecular replacement using members of the experimentally phased set as search models. An automated tool was developed to deposit these structures in the Protein Data Bank, along with the associated X-ray diffraction data (including refined experimental phases) and experimentally confirmed sequences. BLAST comparisons of the SGX structures with structures that had appeared in the Protein Data Bank over the intervening 3.5 years since the SGX target list had been compiled identified homologs for 49 of the 60 unique sequences represented by the SGX structures. This result indicates that, for bacterial structures that are relatively easy to express, purify, and crystallize, the structural coverage of gene space is proceeding rapidly. More distant sequence-structure relationships between the SGX and PDB structures were investigated using PDB-BLAST and Combinatorial Extension (CE). Only one structure, SufD, has a truly unique topology compared to all folds in the PDB.</p>

<p>Pyrimidine metabolism is a major route for therapeutic intervention against malaria. Here we report inhibition and structural studies on the deoxyuridine nucleotidohydrolase from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfdUTPase). We have identified a series of triphenylmethane derivatives of deoxyuridine with antimalarial activity in vitro which inhibit specifically the Plasmodium dUTPase versus the human enzyme. A 2.4 Angstrom crystal structure of PfdUTPase in complex with one of these inhibitors reveals an atypical trimeric enzyme in which the triphenylmethane derivative can be seen to select for PfdUTPase by way of interactions between the trityl group and the side chains of residues Phe46 and Ile117. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies of parasitized red blood cells reveal that enzyme concentrations are highest during the trophozoite/schizont stages, suggesting that PfdUTPase has a major role in DNA replication. Taken together the data show that PfdUTPase may be considered as an antimalarial drug target.</p>

<p>Utilizing X-ray crystal structure analysis, (3S,5R)-5-[4-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-5-oxopiperazin-1-yl]piperidine-3-carboxamides were designed and identified as renin inhibitors. The most potent compound 15 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in rat.</p>

<p>The phosphoprotein (P) of rabies virus binds the viral polymerase to the nucleoprotein (N)-RNA template for transcription and replication. By limited protease digestion we defined a monomeric C-terminal domain of P that can bind to N-RNA. The atomic structure of this domain was determined and previously described mutations that interfere with binding of P to N-RNA could now be interpreted. There appears to be two features involved in this activity situated at opposite surfaces of the molecule: a positively charged patch and a hydrophobic pocket with an exposed tryptophan side-chain. Other previously published work suggests a conformational change in P when it binds to N-RNA, which may imply the repositioning of two helices that would expose a hydrophobic groove for interaction with N. This domain of rabies virus P is structurally unrelated to the N-RNA binding domains of the phosphoproteins of Sendai and measles virus that are members of the same order of viruses, the non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses. The implications of this finding for the evolution of this virus group are discussed.</p>

<p>LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases (LHEs) are a family of highly specific DNA endonucleases capable of recognizing target sequences ≈ 20 bp in length, thus drawing intense interest for their potential academic, biotechnological and clinical applications. Methods for rational design of LHEs to cleave desired target sites are presently limited by a small number of high-quality native LHEs to serve as scaffolds for protein engineering-many are unsatisfactory for gene targeting applications. One strategy to address such limitations is to identify close homologs of existing LHEs possessing superior biophysical or catalytic properties. To test this concept, we searched public sequence databases to identify putative LHE open reading frames homologous to the LHE I-AniI and used a DNA binding and cleavage assay using yeast surface display to rapidly survey a subset of the predicted proteins. These proteins exhibited a range of capacities for surface expression and also displayed locally altered binding and cleavage specificities with a range of in vivo cleavage activities. Of these enzymes, I-HjeMI demonstrated the greatest activity in vivo and was readily crystallizable, allowing a comparative structural analysis. Taken together, our results suggest that even highly homologous LHEs offer a readily accessible resource of related scaffolds that display diverse biochemical properties for biotechnological applications.</p>

<p>Protein kinase autophosphorylation of activation segment residues is a common regulatory mechanism in phosphorylation-dependent signalling cascades. However, the molecular mechanisms that guarantee specific and efficient phosphorylation of these sites have not been elucidated. Here, we report on three novel and diverse protein kinase structures that reveal an exchanged activation segment conformation. This dimeric arrangement results in an active kinase conformation in trans, with activation segment phosphorylation sites in close proximity to the active site of the interacting protomer. Analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking confirmed the presence of dimers in solution. Consensus substrate sequences for each kinase showed that the identified activation segment autophosphorylation sites are non-consensus substrate sites. Based on the presented structural and functional data, a model for specific activation segment phosphorylation at non-consensus substrate sites is proposed that is likely to be common to other kinases from diverse subfamilies.</p>

<p>A series of novel 2-chloro-5-[(1-benzimidazolyl- and 2-benzimidazolylsulfanyl)acetyl]benzene-sulfonamides were designed and synthesized. Their binding to recombinant human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) isozymes I, II, VII, and XIII was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and thermal shift assay. The designed S-alkylated benzimidazole derivatives exhibited stronger binding than the indapamide-like N-alkylated benzimidazoles, with the K(d) reaching about 50-100 nM with drug-targeted hCAs VII and XIII. The cocrystal structures of selected compounds with hCA II were determined by X-ray crystallography, and structural features of the binding event were revealed.</p>

<p>Cdk9, the kinase of the positive transcription elongation factor b, is required for processive transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. Cdk9 inhibition contributes to the anticancer activity of many Cdk inhibitors under clinical investigation and hence there is interest in selective Cdk9 inhibitors. DRB (5,6-dichlorobenzimidazone-1-β-D-ribofuranoside) is a commonly used reagent for Cdk9 inhibition in cell biology studies. The crystal structures of Cdk9 and Cdk2 in complex with DRB reported here describe the molecular basis for the DRB selectivity toward Cdk9. The DRB chlorine atoms form halogen bonds that are specific for the Cdk9 kinase hinge region. Kinetic and thermodynamic experiments validate the structural findings and implicate the C-terminal residues of Cdk9 in contributing to the affinity for DRB. These results open the possibility to exploit halogen atoms in inhibitor design to specifically target Cdk9.</p>

<p>beta-lactamases are the most widespread resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as the penicillins and the cephalosporins. In an effort to combat these enzymes, a combination of stereoselective organic synthesis, enzymology, microbiology, and X-ray crystallography was used to design and evaluate new carboxyphenyl-glycylboronic acid transition-state analogue inhibitors of the class C beta-lactamase AmpC. The new compounds improve inhibition by over 2 orders of magnitude compared to analogous glycylboronic acids, with K(i) values as low as 1 nM. On the basis of the differential binding of different analogues, the introduced carboxylate alone contributes about 2.1 kcal/mol in affinity. This carboxylate corresponds to the ubiquitous C3(4)' carboxylate of beta-lactams, and this energy represents the first thermodynamic measurement of the importance of this group in molecular recognition by class C beta-lactamases. The structures of AmpC in complex with two of these inhibitors were determined by X-ray crystallography at 1.72 and 1.83 A resolution. These structures suggest a structural basis for the high affinity of the new compounds and provide templates for further design. The highest affinity inhibitor was 5 orders of magnitude more selective for AmpC than for characteristic serine proteases, such as chymotrypsin. This inhibitor reversed the resistance of clinical pathogens to the third generation cephalosporin ceftazidime; it may serve as a lead compound for drug discovery to combat bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.</p>

<p>Structures of recombinant phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPATMt) in the apo form and in complex with the substrate ATP were determined at 1.62 and 1.70 Å resolution, respectively, using crystals grown in microgravity by the counter-diffusion method. The ATP molecule of the PPATMt-ATP complex was located with full occupancy in the active-site cavity. Comparison of the solved structures with previously determined structures of PPATMt complexed with the reaction product dephosphocoenzyme A (dPCoA) and the feedback inhibitor coenzyme A (CoA) was performed using superposition on C(α) atoms. The peculiarities of the arrangement of the ligands in the active-site cavity of PPATMt are described. The conformational states of the PPAT molecule in the consequent steps of the catalyzed reaction in the apo enzyme and the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes are characterized. It is shown that the binding of ATP and dPCoA induces the rearrangement of a short part of the polypeptide chain restricting the active-site cavity in the subunits of the hexameric enzyme molecule. The changes in the quaternary structure caused by this rearrangement are accompanied by a variation of the size of the inner water-filled channel which crosses the PPAT molecule along the threefold axis of the hexamer. The molecular mechanism of the observed changes is described.</p>

<p>The maize beta-glucosidase isoenzymes ZMGlu1 and ZMGlu2 hydrolyse the abundant natural substrate DIMBOAGlc (2-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), whose aglycone DIMBOA (2,4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one) is the major defence chemical protecting seedlings and young plant parts against herbivores and other pests. The two isoenzymes hydrolyse DIMBOAGlc with similar kinetics but differ from each other and their sorghum homologues with respect to specificity towards other substrates. To gain insights into the mechanism of substrate (i.e. aglycone) specificity between the two maize isoenzymes and their sorghum homologues, ZMGlu1 was produced in Escherichia coli, purified, crystallized and its structure solved at 2.5 Angstrom resolution by X-ray crystallography. In addition, the complex of ZMGlu1 with the non-hydrolysable inhibitor p-nitrophenyl beta-D-thioglucoside was crystallized and, based on the partial electron density, a model for the inhibitor molecule within the active site is proposed. The inhibitor is located in a slot-like active site where its aromatic aglycone is held by stacking interactions with Trp-378. Whereas some of the atoms on the non-reducing end of the glucose moiety can be modelled on the basis of the electron density, most of the inhibitor atoms are highly disordered. This is attributed to the requirement of the enzyme to accommodate two different species, namely the substrate in its ground state and in its distorted conformation, for catalysis.</p>

<p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases play a key role in protein biosynthesis by catalyzing the specific aminoacylation of tRNA. The energy required for the formation of the ester bond between the amino acid carboxylate group and the tRNA acceptor stem is supplied by coupling the reaction to the hydrolysis of ATP. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli belongs to the family of class II synthetases and carries out a two-step reaction, in which lysine is activated by being attached to the alpha-phosphate of AMP before being transferred to the cognate tRNA. Crystals of the thermo-inducible E. coli lysyl-tRNA synthetase LysU which diffract to 2.1 A resolution have been used to determine crystal structures of the enzyme in the presence of lysine, the lysyl-adenylate intermediate, and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PCP. Additional data have been obtained from crystals soaked in a solution containing ATP and Mn(2+). The refined crystal structures give "snapshots" of the active site corresponding to key steps in the aminoacylation reaction and provide the structural framework for understanding the mechanism of lysine activation. The active site of LysU is shaped to position the substrates for the nucleophilic attack of the lysine carboxylate on the ATP alpha-phosphate. No residues are directly involved in catalysis, but a number of highly conserved amino acids and three metal ions coordinate the substrates and stabilize the pentavalent transition state. A loop close to the catalytic pocket, disordered in the lysine-bound structure, becomes ordered upon adenine binding.</p>

<p>Aquifex aeolicus 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) is active with a variety of different divalent metal ions bound in the active site. The Cd(2+), Zn(2+), and Cu(2+) substituted enzymes display similar values of k(cat) and similar dependence of K(m)(PEP) and K(m)(A5P) on both substrate and product concentrations. However, the flux-control coefficients for some of the catalytically relevant reaction steps are different in the presence of Zn(2+) or Cu(2+), suggesting that the type of metal bound in the active site affects the behavior of the enzyme in vivo. The type of metal also affects the rate of product release in the crystal environment. For example, the crystal structure of the Cu(2+) enzyme incubated with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) shows the formed product, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P), still bound in the active site in its linear conformation. This observation completes our structural studies of the condensation reaction, which altogether have provided high-resolution structures for the reactants, the intermediate, and the product bound forms of KDO8PS. The crystal structures of the Cd(2+), Zn(2+), and Cu(2+) substituted enzymes show four residues (Cys-11, His-185, Glu-222, and Asp-233) and a water molecule as possible metal ligands. Combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) geometry optimizations reveal that the metal centers have a delocalized electronic structure, and that their true geometry is square pyramidal for Cd(2+) and Zn(2+) and distorted octahedral or distorted tetrahedral for Cu(2+). These geometries are different from those obtained by QM optimization in the gas phase (tetrahedral for Cd(2+) and Zn(2+), distorted tetrahedral for Cu(2+)) and may represent conformations of the metal center that minimize the reorganization energy between the substrate-bound and product-bound states. The QM/MM calculations also show that when only PEP is bound to the enzyme the electronic structure of the metal center is optimized to prevent a wasteful reaction of PEP with water.</p>

<p>The hexameric purine nucleoside phosphorylase from Bacillus subtilis (BsPNP233) displays great potential to produce nucleoside analogues in industry and can be exploited in the development of new anti-tumor gene therapies. In order to provide structural basis for enzyme and substrates rational optimization, aiming at those applications, the present work shows a thorough and detailed structural description of the binding mode of substrates and nucleoside analogues to the active site of the hexameric BsPNP233. Here we report the crystal structure of BsPNP233 in the apo form and in complex with 11 ligands, including clinically relevant compounds. The crystal structure of six ligands (adenine, 2'deoxyguanosine, aciclovir, ganciclovir, 8-bromoguanosine, 6-chloroguanosine) in complex with a hexameric PNP are presented for the first time. Our data showed that free bases adopt alternative conformations in the BsPNP233 active site and indicated that binding of the co-substrate (2'deoxy)ribose 1-phosphate might contribute for stabilizing the bases in a favorable orientation for catalysis. The BsPNP233-adenosine complex revealed that a hydrogen bond between the 5' hydroxyl group of adenosine and Arg(43*) side chain contributes for the ribosyl radical to adopt an unusual C3'-endo conformation. The structures with 6-chloroguanosine and 8-bromoguanosine pointed out that the Cl(6) and Br(8) substrate modifications seem to be detrimental for catalysis and can be explored in the design of inhibitors for hexameric PNPs from pathogens. Our data also corroborated the competitive inhibition mechanism of hexameric PNPs by tubercidin and suggested that the acyclic nucleoside ganciclovir is a better inhibitor for hexameric PNPs than aciclovir. Furthermore, comparative structural analyses indicated that the replacement of Ser(90) by a threonine in the B. cereus hexameric adenosine phosphorylase (Thr(91)) is responsible for the lack of negative cooperativity of phosphate binding in this enzyme.</p>

<p>Mutants of HIV-1 protease that are commonly selected on exposure to different drugs, V82S, G48V, N88D and L90M, showed reduced catalytic activity compared to the wild-type protease on cleavage site peptides, CA-p2, p6pol-PR and PR-RT, critical for viral maturation. Mutant V82S is the least active (2-20% of wild-type protease), mutants N88D, R8Q, and L90M exhibit activities ranging from 20 to 40% and G48V from 50 to 80% of the wild-type activity. In contrast, D30N is variable in its activity on different substrates (10-110% of wild-type), with the PR-RT site being the most affected. Mutants K45I and M46L, usually selected in combination with other mutations, showed activities that are similar to (60-110%) or greater than (110-530%) wild-type, respectively. No direct relationship was observed between catalytic activity, inhibition, and structural stability. The mutants D30N and V82S were similar to wild-type protease in their stability toward urea denaturation, while R8Q, G48V, and L90M showed 1.5 to 2.7-fold decreased stability, and N88D and K45I showed 1.6 to 1.7-fold increased stability. The crystal structures of R8Q, K45I and L90M mutants complexed with a CA-p2 analog inhibitor were determined at 2.0, 1.55 and 1.88 A resolution, respectively, and compared to the wild-type structure. The intersubunit hydrophobic contacts observed in the crystal structures are in good agreement with the relative structural stability of the mutant proteases. All these results suggest that viral resistance does not arise by a single mechanism.</p>

<p>DNMT1, the major maintenance DNA methyltransferase in animals, helps to regulate gene expression, genome imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. We report on the crystal structure of a productive covalent mouse DNMT1(731-1602)-DNA complex containing a central hemimethylated CpG site. The methyl group of methylcytosine is positioned within a shallow hydrophobic concave surface, whereas the cytosine on the target strand is looped out and covalently anchored within the catalytic pocket. The DNA is distorted at the hemimethylated CpG step, with side chains from catalytic and recognition loops inserting through both grooves to fill an intercalation-type cavity associated with a dual base flip-out on partner strands. Structural and biochemical data establish how a combination of active and autoinhibitory mechanisms ensures the high fidelity of DNMT1-mediated maintenance DNA methylation.</p>

<p>Metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) require Zn(2+) or Fe(2+) to regulate the acetylation of lysine residues in histones and other proteins in eukaryotic cells. Isozyme HDAC8 is perhaps the archetypical member of the class I HDAC family and serves as a paradigm for studying structure-function relationships. Here, we report the structures of HDAC8 complexes with trichostatin A and 3-(1-methyl-4-phenylacetyl-1H-2-pyrrolyl)-N-hydroxy-2-propenamide (APHA) in a new crystal form. The structure of the APHA complex reveals that the hydroxamate CO group accepts a hydrogen bond from Y306 but does not coordinate to Zn(2+) with favorable geometry, perhaps due to the constraints of its extended pi system. Additionally, since APHA binds to only two of the three protein molecules in the asymmetric unit of this complex, the structure of the third monomer represents the first structure of HDAC8 in the unliganded state. Comparison of unliganded and liganded structures illustrates ligand-induced conformational changes in the L2 loop that likely accompany substrate binding and catalysis. Furthermore, these structures, along with those of the D101N, D101E, D101A, and D101L variants, support the proposal that D101 is critical for the function of the L2 loop. However, amino acid substitutions for D101 can also trigger conformational changes of Y111 and W141 that perturb the substrate binding site. Finally, the structure of H143A HDAC8 complexed with an intact acetylated tetrapeptide substrate molecule confirms the importance of D101 for substrate binding and reveals how Y306 and the active site zinc ion together bind and activate the scissile amide linkage of acetyllysine.</p>

<p>Phosphotriesterase (PTE) from Pseudomonas diminuta catalyzes the detoxification of organophosphates such as the widely utilized insecticide paraoxon and the chemical warfare agent sarin. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is known from high resolution x-ray crystallographic analyses. Each subunit of the homodimer folds into a so-called TIM barrel, with eight strands of parallel beta-sheet. The two zinc ions required for activity are positioned at the C-terminal portion of the beta-barrel. Here, we describe the three-dimensional structure of PTE complexed with the inhibitor diisopropyl methyl phosphonate, which serves as a mimic for sarin. Additionally, the structure of the enzyme complexed with triethyl phosphate is also presented. In the case of the PTE-diisopropyl methyl phosphonate complex, the phosphoryl oxygen of the inhibitor coordinates to the more solvent-exposed zinc ion (2.5 A), thereby lending support to the presumed catalytic mechanism involving metal coordination of the substrate. In the PTE-triethyl phosphate complex, the phosphoryl oxygen of the inhibitor is positioned at 3.4 A from the more solvent-exposed zinc ion. The two structures described in this report provide additional molecular understanding for the ability of this remarkable enzyme to hydrolyze such a wide range of organophosphorus substrates.</p>

<p>The inhibition of PKC-zeta has been proposed to be a potential drug target for immune and inflammatory diseases. A series of 2-(6-phenyl-1H indazol-3-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazoles with initial high crossover to CDK-2 has been optimized to afford potent and selective inhibitors of protein kinase c-zeta (PKC-zeta). The determination of the crystal structures of key inhibitor:CDK-2 complexes informed the design and analysis of the series. The most selective and potent analog was identified by variation of the aryl substituent at the 6-position of the indazole template to give a 4-NH(2) derivative. The analog displays good selectivity over other PKC isoforms (alpha, betaII, gamma, delta, epsilon, mu, theta, eta and iota/lambda) and CDK-2, however it displays marginal selectivity against a panel of other kinases (37 profiled).</p>

<p>Metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) require Zn(2+) or Fe(2+) to regulate the acetylation of lysine residues in histones and other proteins in eukaryotic cells. Isozyme HDAC8 is perhaps the archetypical member of the class I HDAC family and serves as a paradigm for studying structure-function relationships. Here, we report the structures of HDAC8 complexes with trichostatin A and 3-(1-methyl-4-phenylacetyl-1H-2-pyrrolyl)-N-hydroxy-2-propenamide (APHA) in a new crystal form. The structure of the APHA complex reveals that the hydroxamate CO group accepts a hydrogen bond from Y306 but does not coordinate to Zn(2+) with favorable geometry, perhaps due to the constraints of its extended pi system. Additionally, since APHA binds to only two of the three protein molecules in the asymmetric unit of this complex, the structure of the third monomer represents the first structure of HDAC8 in the unliganded state. Comparison of unliganded and liganded structures illustrates ligand-induced conformational changes in the L2 loop that likely accompany substrate binding and catalysis. Furthermore, these structures, along with those of the D101N, D101E, D101A, and D101L variants, support the proposal that D101 is critical for the function of the L2 loop. However, amino acid substitutions for D101 can also trigger conformational changes of Y111 and W141 that perturb the substrate binding site. Finally, the structure of H143A HDAC8 complexed with an intact acetylated tetrapeptide substrate molecule confirms the importance of D101 for substrate binding and reveals how Y306 and the active site zinc ion together bind and activate the scissile amide linkage of acetyllysine.</p>

<p>Histidine kinase receptors are a large family of membrane-spanning proteins found in many prokaryotes and some eukaryotes. They are a part of two-component signal transduction systems, which each comprise a sensor kinase and a response regulator and are involved with the regulation of many cellular processes. NarX is a histidine kinase receptor that responds to nitrate and nitrite to effect regulation of anaerobic respiration in various bacteria. We present high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domain from Escherichia coli NarX in a complex with nitrate and in the apo state. Our analysis reveals that nitrate-binding induces conformation changes that result in a piston-type displacement between the N- and C-terminal helices of the periplasmic domain. Such conformational changes might represent a conserved mechanism of signaling in histidine kinases by which ligand binding is communicated across the lipid bilayer.</p>

<p>Nucleotide sugars and the enzymes that are responsible for their synthesis are indispensable for the production of complex carbohydrates and, thus, for elaboration of a protective cellular coat for many organisms such as the protozoan parasite Leishmania. These activated sugars are synthesized de novo or derived from salvaged monosaccharides. In addition to UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) pyrophosphorylase, which catalyzes the formation of UDP-Glc from substrates UTP and glucose-1-phosphate, Leishmania major and plants express a UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (USP) that exhibits broad substrate specificity in vitro. The enzyme, likely involved in monosaccharide salvage, preferentially generates UDP-Glc and UDP-galactose, but it may also activate other hexose- or pentose-1-phosphates such as galacturonic acid-1-phosphate or arabinose-1-phosphate. In order to gain insight into structural features governing the differences in substrate specificity, we determined the crystal structure of the L. major USP in the APO-, UTP-, and UDP-sugar-bound conformations. The overall tripartite structure of USP exhibits a significant structural homology to other nucleotidyldiphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylases. The obtained USP structures reveal the structural rearrangements occurring during the stepwise binding process of the substrates. Moreover, the different product complexes explain the broad substrate specificity of USP, which is enabled by structural changes in the sugar binding region of the active site.</p>

<p>The X-ray structure of yeast 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase, in which the catalytic site of the enzyme is complexed with a putative cyclic intermediate composed of both substrate moieties, has been solved at 0.16 nm (1.6 A) resolution. The cyclic intermediate is bound covalently to Lys(263) with the amino group of the aminomethyl side chain ligated to the active-site zinc ion in a position normally occupied by a catalytic hydroxide ion. The cyclic intermediate is catalytically competent, as shown by its turnover in the presence of added substrate to form porphobilinogen. The findings, combined with those of previous studies, are consistent with a catalytic mechanism in which the C-C bond linking both substrates in the intermediate is formed before the C-N bond.</p>

<p>N-Acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK), the structural paradigm of the enzymes of the amino acid kinase family, catalyzes the phosphorylation of the gamma-COO(-) group of N-acetyl-L-glutamate (NAG) by ATP. We determine here the crystal structures of NAGK complexes with MgADP, NAG and the transition-state analog AlF(4)(-); with MgADP and NAG; and with ADP and SO(4)(2-). Comparison of these structures with that of the MgAMPPNP-NAG complex allows to delineate three successive steps during phosphoryl transfer: at the beginning, when the attacking and leaving O atoms and the P atom are imperfectly aligned and the distance between the attacking O atom and the P atom is 2.8A; midway, at the bipyramidal intermediate, with nearly perfect alignment and a distance of 2.3A; and, when the transfer is completed. The transfer occurs in line and is strongly associative, with Lys8 and Lys217 stabilizing the transition state and the leaving group, respectively, and with Lys61, in contrast with an earlier proposal, not being involved. Three water molecules found in all the complexes play, together with Asp162 and the Mg, crucial structural roles. Two glycine-rich loops (beta1-alphaA and beta2-alphaB) are also very important, moving in the different complexes in concert with the ligands, to which they are hydrogen-bonded, either locking them in place for reaction or stabilizing the transition state. The active site is too narrow to accommodate the substrates without compressing the reacting groups, and this compressive strain appears a crucial component of the catalytic mechanism of NAGK, and possibly of other enzymes of the amino acid kinase family such as carbamate kinase. Initial binding of the two substrates would require a different enzyme conformation with a wider active site, and the energy of substrate binding would be used to change the conformation of the active center, causing substrate strain towards the transition state.</p>

<p>Organophosphorus compound-based nerve agents inhibit the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) causing acute toxicity and death. Clinical treatment of nerve-agent poisoning is to use oxime-based antidotes to reactivate the inhibited AChE. However, the nerve agent tabun is resistant to oximes. To design improved oximes, crystal structures of a tabun-conjugated AChE in complex with different oximes are needed to guide the structural modifications of known antidotes. However, this type of structure is extremely challenging to obtain because both deamidation of the tabun conjugate and reactivation of AChE occur during crystallographic experiments. Here we report, for the first time, the crystal structures of Ortho-7 and HLö-7 in complex with AChE that is conjugated to an intact tabun. These structures were determined by our new strategy of combining crystallographic and mass spectrometric analyses of AChE crystals. The results explain the relative reactivation potencies of the two oximes and offer insights into improving known medical antidotes.</p>

<p>The plant cell wall is a complex material in which the cellulose microfibrils are embedded within a mesh of other polysaccharides, some of which are loosely termed "hemicellulose." One such hemicellulose is xyloglucan, which displays a beta-1,4-linked d-glucose backbone substituted with xylose, galactose, and occasionally fucose moieties. Both xyloglucan and the enzymes responsible for its modification and degradation are finding increasing prominence, reflecting both the drive for enzymatic biomass conversion, their role in detergent applications, and the utility of modified xyloglucans for cellulose fiber modification. Here we present the enzymatic characterization and three-dimensional structures in ligand-free and xyloglucan-oligosaccharide complexed forms of two distinct xyloglucanases from glycoside hydrolase families GH5 and GH12. The enzymes, Paenibacillus pabuli XG5 and Bacillus licheniformis XG12, both display open active center grooves grafted upon their respective (beta/alpha)(8) and beta-jelly roll folds, in which the side chain decorations of xyloglucan may be accommodated. For the beta-jelly roll enzyme topology of GH12, binding of xylosyl and pendant galactosyl moieties is tolerated, but the enzyme is similarly competent in the degradation of unbranched glucans. In the case of the (beta/alpha)(8) GH5 enzyme, kinetically productive interactions are made with both xylose and galactose substituents, as reflected in both a high specific activity on xyloglucan and the kinetics of a series of aryl glycosides. The differential strategies for the accommodation of the side chains of xyloglucan presumably facilitate the action of these microbial hydrolases in milieus where diverse and differently substituted substrates may be encountered.</p>

<p>Selenocysteine lyase (SCL) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent removal of selenium from l-selenocysteine to yield l-alanine. The enzyme is proposed to function in the recycling of the micronutrient selenium from degraded selenoproteins containing selenocysteine residue as an essential component. The enzyme exhibits strict substrate specificity toward l-selenocysteine and no activity to its cognate l-cysteine. However, it remains unclear how the enzyme distinguishes between selenocysteine and cysteine. Here, we present mechanistic studies of selenocysteine lyase from rat. ESI-MS analysis of wild-type and C375A mutant SCL revealed that the catalytic reaction proceeds via the formation of an enzyme-bound selenopersulfide intermediate on the catalytically essential Cys-375 residue. UV-visible spectrum analysis and the crystal structure of SCL complexed with l-cysteine demonstrated that the enzyme reversibly forms a nonproductive adduct with l-cysteine. Cys-375 on the flexible loop directed l-selenocysteine, but not l-cysteine, to the correct position and orientation in the active site to initiate the catalytic reaction. These findings provide, for the first time, the basis for understanding how trace amounts of a selenium-containing substrate is distinguished from excessive amounts of its cognate sulfur-containing compound in a biological system.</p>

<p>Two closely related binding modes have previously been proposed for the ATP-competitive benzimidazole class of checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) inhibitors; however, neither binding mode is entirely consistent with the reported SAR. Unconstrained rigid docking of benzimidazole ligands into representative CHK2 protein crystal structures reveals an alternative binding mode involving a water-mediated interaction with the hinge region; docking which incorporates protein side chain flexibility for selected residues in the ATP binding site resulted in a refinement of the water-mediated hinge binding mode that is consistent with observed SAR. The flexible docking results are in good agreement with the crystal structures of four exemplar benzimidazole ligands bound to CHK2 which unambiguously confirmed the binding mode of these inhibitors, including the water-mediated interaction with the hinge region, and which is significantly different from binding modes previously postulated in the literature.</p>

<p>Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway, which provides an alternative to the de novo pathway for the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides. PNP catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of 2'-deoxypurine ribonucleosides to the free bases and 2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate. Absence of PNP activity in humans is associated with specific T-cell immune suppression. Its key role in these two processes has made PNP an important drug design target. We have investigated the structural details of the PNP-catalyzed reaction by determining the structures of bovine PNP complexes with various substrates and substrate analogues. The preparation of phosphate-free crystals of PNP has allowed us to analyze several novel complexes, including the ternary complex of PNP, purine base, and ribose 1-phosphate and of the completely unbound PNP. These results provide an atomic view for the catalytic mechanism for PNP proposed by M. D. Erion et al. [(1997) Biochemistry 36, 11735-11748], in which an oxocarbenium intermediate is stabilized by phosphate and the negative charge on the purine base is stabilized by active site residues. The bovine PNP structure reveals several new details of substrate and inhibitor binding, including two phosphate-induced conformational changes involving residues 33-36 and 56-69 and a previously undetected role for His64 in phosphate binding. In addition, a well-ordered water molecule is found in the PNP active site when purine base or nucleoside is also present. In contrast to human PNP, only one phosphate binding site was observed. Although binary complexes were observed for nucleoside, purine base, or phosphate, ribose 1-phosphate binding occurs only in the presence of purine base.</p>

<p>Adenosine kinase (AK) is a key enzyme in purine metabolism in the ubiquitous intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii and is a potential chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of T. gondii infections. To better understand the structure-activity relationship of 6-substituted purine ribosides, the structures of the T. gondii AK-N6,N6-dimethyladenosine (DMA) complex, the AK-DMA-AMP-PCP complex, the AK-6-methyl mercaptopurine riboside (MMPR) complex and the AK-MMPR-AMP-PCP complex were determined to 1.35, 1.35, 1.75 and 1.75 A resolution, respectively. These structures reveal a conformation intermediate between open and closed, with a small lid-domain rotation of 12 degrees . Residues Gly143-X-X-Gly146 undergo torsional changes upon substrate binding, which together with a Gly68-Gly69 switch induces a hinge bending of the lid domain. The intermediate conformation suggests that ATP binding is independent of adenosine binding. Orienting the gamma-phosphate group of ATP into the optimal catalytic position may be the last step before the onset of chemical catalysis and may require the translocation of Arg136 following the complete closure of the lid domain. 6-Substituted purine-nucleoside analogs are accommodated in a hydrophobic cavity. Modification at the N6 or C6 position of the nucleoside would affect the interactions with the surrounding residues and the binding affinity.</p>

<p>The ternary complex crystal structures of Cryptococcus neoformans and Escherichia coli thymidylate synthase (TS) suggest mechanisms of species-specific inhibition of a highly conserved protein. The 2.1 Angstrom structure of C. neoformans TS cocrystallized with substrate and the cofactor analog CB3717 shows that the binding sites for substrate and cofactor are highly conserved with respect to human TS, but that the structure of the cofactor-binding site of C. neoformans TS is less constrained by surrounding residues. This feature might allow C. neoformans TS to form TS-dUMP-inhibitor complexes with a greater range of antifolates than human TS. 3',3''-Dibromophenol-4-chloro-1,8-naphthalein (GA9) selectively inhibits both E. coli TS and C. neoformans TS (K(i) = 4 microM) over human TS (K(i) &gt;&gt; 245 microM). The E. coli TS-dUMP-GA9 complex is in an open conformation, similar to that of the apoenzyme crystal structure. The GA9-binding site overlaps the binding site of the pABA-glutamyl moiety of the cofactor. The fact that human apoTS can adopt an unusual fold in which the GA9-binding site is disordered may explain the poor affinity of GA9 for the human enzyme. These observations highlight the critical need to incorporate multiple target conformations in any computational attempt to facilitate drug discovery.</p>

<p>Ribose-1,5-bisphosphate isomerase (R15Pi) is a novel enzyme recently identified as a member of an AMP metabolic pathway in archaea. The enzyme converts d-ribose 1,5-bisphosphate into ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, providing the substrate for archaeal ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenases. We here report the crystal structures of R15Pi from Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 (Tk-R15Pi) with and without its substrate or product. Tk-R15Pi is a hexameric enzyme formed by the trimerization of dimer units. Biochemical analyses show that Tk-R15Pi only accepts the α-anomer of d-ribose 1,5-bisphosphate and that Cys(133) and Asp(202) residues are essential for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate production. Comparison of the determined structures reveals that the unliganded and product-binding structures are in an open form, whereas the substrate-binding structure adopts a closed form, indicating domain movement upon substrate binding. The conformational change to the closed form optimizes active site configuration and also isolates the active site from the solvent, which may allow deprotonation of Cys(133) and protonation of Asp(202) to occur. The structural features of the substrate-binding form and biochemical evidence lead us to propose that the isomerase reaction proceeds via a cis-phosphoenolate intermediate.</p>

<p>An unexpected biochemical strategy for chain initiation is described for the loading module of the polyketide synthase of curacin A, an anticancer lead derived from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. A central GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) domain bears bifunctional decarboxylase/S-acetyltransferase activity, both unprecedented for the GNAT superfamily. A CurA loading tridomain, consisting of an adaptor domain, the GNAT domain, and an acyl carrier protein, was assessed biochemically, revealing that a domain showing homology to GNAT (GNAT(L)) catalyzes (i) decarboxylation of malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) to acetyl-CoA and (ii) direct S-acetyl transfer from acetyl-CoA to load an adjacent acyl carrier protein domain (ACP(L)). Moreover, the N-terminal adapter domain was shown to facilitate acetyl-group transfer. Crystal structures of GNAT(L) were solved at 1.95 angstroms (ligand-free form) and 2.75 angstroms (acyl-CoA complex), showing distinct substrate tunnels for acyl-CoA and holo-ACP(L) binding. Modeling and site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that histidine-389 and threonine-355, at the convergence of the CoA and ACP tunnels, participate in malonyl-CoA decarboxylation but not in acetyl-group transfer. Decarboxylation precedes acetyl-group transfer, leading to acetyl-ACP(L) as the key curacin A starter unit.</p>

<p>The adenosylcobalamin-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA by a free-radical mechanism. The recently solved X-ray crystal structure of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from Propionibacterium shermanii has shown that tyrosine 89 is an active-site residue involved in substrate binding. The role of tyrosine 89, a conserved residue among methylmalonyl-CoA mutases, has been investigated by using site-directed mutagenesis to replace this residue with phenylalanine. The crystal structure of the Tyr89Phe mutant was determined to 2.2 A resolution and was found to be essentially superimposable on that of wild-type. Mutant and wild-type enzyme have very similar KM values, but kcat for the Tyr89Phe mutant is 580-fold lower than for wild-type. The rate of release of tritium from 5'-[3H]adenosylcobalamin during the enzymatic reaction and its rate of appearance in substrate and product were measured. The tritium released was found to partition unequally between methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, in a ratio of 40:60 when the reaction was initiated by addition of methylmalonyl-CoA and in a ratio of 10:90 when the reaction was initiated by addition of succinyl-CoA. The overall release of tritium was four times faster when succinyl-CoA was used as substrate. The tritium isotope effect on the enzyme catalyzed hydrogen transfer, measured with methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate, was kH/kT = 30, which is within the expected range for a full primary kinetic tritium isotope effect. The different partitioning of tritium, dependent upon which substrate was used, and the normal value for the kinetic tritium isotope effect contrast markedly with the behavior of wild-type mutase. It appears that the loss of a single interaction involving the hydroxyl group of tyrosine 89 both affects the stability of radical intermediates and decreases the rate of interconversion of the substrate- and product-derived radicals.</p>

<p>In the present study, we investigate the impact of a tightly bound water molecule on ligand binding in the S1 pocket of thrombin. The S1 pocket contains a deeply buried deprotonated aspartate residue (Asp189) that is, due to its charged state, well hydrated in the uncomplexed state. We systematically studied the importance of this water molecule by evaluating a series of ligands that contains pyridine-type P1 side chains that could potentially alter the binding properties of this water molecule. All of the pyridine derivatives retain the original hydration state albeit sometimes with a slight perturbance. In order to prevent a direct H-bond formation with Asp189, and to create a permanent positive charge on the P1 side chain that is positioned adjacent to the Asp189 carboxylate anion, we methylated the pyridine nitrogen. This methylation resulted in displacement of water but was accompanied by a loss in binding affinity. Quantum chemical calculations of the ligand solvation free energy showed that the positively charged methylpyridinium derivatives suffer a large penalty of desolvation upon binding. Consequently, they have a substantially less favorable enthalpy of binding. In addition to the ligand desolvation penalty, the hydration shell around Asp189 has to be overcome, which is achieved in nearly all pyridinium derivatives. Only for the ortho derivative is a partial population of a water next to Asp189 found. Possibly, the gain of electrostatic interactions between the charged P1 side chain and Asp189 helps to compensate for the desolvation penalty. In all uncharged pyridine derivatives, the solvation shell remains next to Asp189, partly mediating interactions between ligand and protein. In the case of the para-pyridine derivative, a strongly disordered cluster of water sites is observed between ligand and Asp189.</p>

<p>The polyisoprenoid compound undecaprenyl phosphate is required for biosynthesis of cell wall peptidoglycans in gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus spp. In these organisms, the mevalonate pathway is used to produce the precursor isoprenoid, isopentenyl 5-diphosphate. Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) catalyzes formation of isopentenyl 5-diphosphate in an ATP-dependent irreversible reaction and is therefore an attractive target for inhibitor development that could lead to new antimicrobial agents. To facilitate exploration of this possibility, we report the crystal structure of Staphylococcus epidermidis MDD (1.85 Å resolution) and, to the best of our knowledge, the first structures of liganded MDD. These structures include MDD bound to the mevalonate 5-diphosphate analogs diphosphoglycolyl proline (2.05 Å resolution) and 6-fluoromevalonate diphosphate (FMVAPP; 2.2 Å resolution). Comparison of these structures provides a physical basis for the significant differences in K(i) values observed for these inhibitors. Inspection of enzyme/inhibitor structures identified the side chain of invariant Ser(192) as making potential contributions to catalysis. Significantly, Ser → Ala substitution of this side chain decreases k(cat) by ∼10(3)-fold, even though binding interactions between FMVAPP and this mutant are similar to those observed with wild type MDD, as judged by the 2.1 Å cocrystal structure of S192A with FMVAPP. Comparison of microbial MDD structures with those of mammalian counterparts reveals potential targets at the active site periphery that may be exploited to selectively target the microbial enzymes. These studies provide a structural basis for previous observations regarding the MDD mechanism and inform future work toward rational inhibitor design.</p>

<p>5'-Methylthioadenosine (MTA)/S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) nucleosidase (MTAN) is essential for cellular metabolism and development in many bacterial species. While the enzyme is found in plants, plant MTANs appear to select for MTA preferentially, with little or no affinity for SAH. To understand what determines substrate specificity in this enzyme, MTAN homologues from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtMTAN1 and AtMTAN2, which are referred to as AtMTN1 and AtMTN2 in the plant literature) have been characterized kinetically. While both homologues hydrolyze MTA with comparable kinetic parameters, only AtMTAN2 shows activity towards SAH. AtMTAN2 also has higher catalytic activity towards other substrate analogues with longer 5'-substituents. The structures of apo AtMTAN1 and its complexes with the substrate- and transition-state-analogues, 5'-methylthiotubercidin and formycin A, respectively, have been determined at 2.0-1.8 A resolution. A homology model of AtMTAN2 was generated using the AtMTAN1 structures. Comparison of the AtMTAN1 and AtMTAN2 structures reveals that only three residues in the active site differ between the two enzymes. Our analysis suggests that two of these residues, Leu181/Met168 and Phe148/Leu135 in AtMTAN1/AtMTAN2, likely account for the divergence in specificity of the enzymes. Comparison of the AtMTAN1 and available Escherichia coli MTAN (EcMTAN) structures suggests that a combination of differences in the 5'-alkylthio binding region and reduced conformational flexibility in the AtMTAN1 active site likely contribute to its reduced efficiency in binding substrate analogues with longer 5'-substituents. In addition, in contrast to EcMTAN, the active site of AtMTAN1 remains solvated in its ligand-bound forms. As the apparent pK(a) of an amino acid depends on its local environment, the putative catalytic acid Asp225 in AtMTAN1 may not be protonated at physiological pH and this suggests the transition state of AtMTAN1, like human MTA phosphorylase and Streptococcus pneumoniae MTAN, may be different from that found in EcMTAN.</p>

<p>Glutamate carboxypeptidase III (GCPIII) is a metalloenzyme that belongs to the transferrin receptor/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII; EC 3.4.17.21) superfamily. GCPIII has been studied mainly because of its evolutionary relationship to GCPII, an enzyme involved in a variety of neuropathologies and malignancies, such as glutamatergic neurotoxicity and prostate cancer. Given the potential functional and pharmacological overlap between GCPIII and GCPII, studies addressing the structural and physiological properties of GCPIII are crucial for obtaining a deeper understanding of the GCPII/GCPIII system. In the present study, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the human GCPIII ectodomain in a 'pseudo-unliganded' state and in a complex with: (a) L-glutamate (a product of hydrolysis); (b) a phosphapeptide transition state mimetic, namely (2S,3'S)-{[(3'-amino-3'-carboxy-propyl)-hydroxyphosphinoyl]methyl}-pentanedioic acid; and (c) quisqualic acid, a glutamate biostere. Our data reveal the overall fold and quaternary arrangement of the GCPIII molecule, define the architecture of the GCPIII substrate-binding cavity, and offer an experimental evidence for the presence of Zn(2+) ions in the bimetallic active site. Furthermore, the structures allow us to detail interactions between the enzyme and its ligands and to characterize the functional flexibility of GCPIII, which is essential for substrate recognition. A comparison of these GCPIII structures with the equivalent GCPII complexes reveals differences in the organization of specificity pockets, in surface charge distribution, and in the occupancy of the co-catalytic zinc sites. The data presented here provide information that should prove to be essential for the structurally-aided design of GCPIII-specific inhibitors and might comprise guidelines for future comparative GCPII/GCPIII studies.</p>

<p>We have designed and synthesized a series of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) with enamino-oxindole substituents optimized to interact with the S2' subsite of the HIV protease binding pocket. Several of these inhibitors have sub-nanomolar K(i) and antiviral IC(50) in the low nM range against WT HIV and against a panel of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains.</p>

<p>Activity of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase APH(3')-Ia leads to resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, and contributes to the clinical obsolescence of this class of antibiotics. One strategy to rescue compromised antibiotics such as aminoglycosides is targeting the enzymes that confer resistance with small molecules. We demonstrated previously that ePK (eukaryotic protein kinase) inhibitors could inhibit APH enzymes, owing to the structural similarity between these two enzyme families. However, limited structural information of enzyme-inhibitor complexes hindered interpretation of the results. In addition, cross-reactivity of compounds between APHs and ePKs represents an obstacle to their use as aminoglycoside adjuvants to rescue aminoglycoside antibiotic activity. In the present study, we structurally and functionally characterize inhibition of APH(3')-Ia by three diverse chemical scaffolds, anthrapyrazolone, 4-anilinoquinazoline and PP (pyrazolopyrimidine), and reveal distinctions in the binding mode of anthrapyrazolone and PP compounds to APH(3')-Ia compared with ePKs. Using this observation, we identify PP derivatives that select against ePKs, attenuate APH(3')-Ia activity and rescue aminoglycoside antibiotic activity against a resistant Escherichia coli strain. The structures described in the present paper and the inhibition studies provide an important opportunity for structure-based design of compounds to target aminoglycoside phosphotransferases for inhibition, potentially overcoming this form of antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p>Activity of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase APH(3')-Ia leads to resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, and contributes to the clinical obsolescence of this class of antibiotics. One strategy to rescue compromised antibiotics such as aminoglycosides is targeting the enzymes that confer resistance with small molecules. We demonstrated previously that ePK (eukaryotic protein kinase) inhibitors could inhibit APH enzymes, owing to the structural similarity between these two enzyme families. However, limited structural information of enzyme-inhibitor complexes hindered interpretation of the results.

<p>Thiamin diphosphate, the vitamin B1 coenzyme, plays critical roles in fundamental metabolic pathways that require acyl carbanion equivalents. Studies on chemical models and enzymes had suggested that these carbanions are resonance-stabilized as enamines. A crystal structure of this intermediate in pyruvate oxidase at 1.1 Å resolution now challenges this paradigm by revealing that the enamine does not accumulate. Instead, the intermediate samples between the ketone and the carbanion both interlocked in a tautomeric equilibrium. Formation of the keto tautomer is associated with a loss of aromaticity of the cofactor. The alternate confinement of electrons to neighboring atoms rather than π-conjugation seems to be of importance for the enzyme-catalyzed, redox-coupled acyl transfer to phosphate, which requires a dramatic inversion of polarity of the reacting substrate carbon in two subsequent catalytic steps. The ability to oscillate between a nucleophilic (carbanion) and an electrophilic (ketone) substrate center highlights a hitherto unrecognized versatility of the thiamin cofactor. It remains to be studied whether formation of the keto tautomer is a general feature of all thiamin enzymes, as it could provide for stable storage of the carbanion state, or whether this feature represents a specific trait of thiamin oxidases. In addition, the protonation state of the two-electron reduced flavin cofactor can be fully assigned, demonstrating the power of high-resolution cryocrystallography for elucidation of enzymatic mechanisms.</p>

<p>Human choline kinase (ChoK) catalyzes the first reaction in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and exists as ChoKalpha (alpha1 and alpha2) and ChoKbeta isoforms. Recent studies suggest that ChoK is implicated in tumorigenesis and emerging as an attractive target for anticancer chemotherapy. To extend our understanding of the molecular mechanism of ChoK inhibition, we have determined the high resolution x-ray structures of the ChoKalpha1 and ChoKbeta isoforms in complex with hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), a known inhibitor of ChoK. In both structures, HC-3 bound at the conserved hydrophobic groove on the C-terminal lobe. One of the HC-3 oxazinium rings complexed with ChoKalpha1 occupied the choline-binding pocket, providing a structural explanation for its inhibitory action. Interestingly, the HC-3 molecule co-crystallized with ChoKbeta was phosphorylated in the choline binding site. This phosphorylation, albeit occurring at a very slow rate, was confirmed experimentally by mass spectroscopy and radioactive assays. Detailed kinetic studies revealed that HC-3 is a much more potent inhibitor for ChoKalpha isoforms (alpha1 and alpha2) compared with ChoKbeta. Mutational studies based on the structures of both inhibitor-bound ChoK complexes demonstrated that Leu-401 of ChoKalpha2 (equivalent to Leu-419 of ChoKalpha1), or the corresponding residue Phe-352 of ChoKbeta, which is one of the hydrophobic residues neighboring the active site, influences the plasticity of the HC-3-binding groove, thereby playing a key role in HC-3 sensitivity and phosphorylation.</p>

<p>Glutamate carboxypeptidase III (GCPIII) is a metalloenzyme that belongs to the transferrin receptor/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII; EC 3.4.17.21) superfamily. GCPIII has been studied mainly because of its evolutionary relationship to GCPII, an enzyme involved in a variety of neuropathologies and malignancies, such as glutamatergic neurotoxicity and prostate cancer. Given the potential functional and pharmacological overlap between GCPIII and GCPII, studies addressing the structural and physiological properties of GCPIII are crucial for obtaining a deeper understanding of the GCPII/GCPIII system. In the present study, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the human GCPIII ectodomain in a 'pseudo-unliganded' state and in a complex with: (a) L-glutamate (a product of hydrolysis); (b) a phosphapeptide transition state mimetic, namely (2S,3'S)-{[(3'-amino-3'-carboxy-propyl)-hydroxyphosphinoyl]methyl}-pentanedioic acid; and (c) quisqualic acid, a glutamate biostere. Our data reveal the overall fold and quaternary arrangement of the GCPIII molecule, define the architecture of the GCPIII substrate-binding cavity, and offer an experimental evidence for the presence of Zn(2+) ions in the bimetallic active site. Furthermore, the structures allow us to detail interactions between the enzyme and its ligands and to characterize the functional flexibility of GCPIII, which is essential for substrate recognition. A comparison of these GCPIII structures with the equivalent GCPII complexes reveals differences in the organization of specificity pockets, in surface charge distribution, and in the occupancy of the co-catalytic zinc sites. The data presented here provide information that should prove to be essential for the structurally-aided design of GCPIII-specific inhibitors and might comprise guidelines for future comparative GCPII/GCPIII studies.</p>

<p>Although they represent attractive therapeutic targets, caspases have so far proven recalcitrant to the development of drugs targeting the active site. Allosteric modulation of caspase activity is an alternate strategy that potentially avoids the need for anionic and electrophilic functionality present in most active-site inhibitors. Caspase-6 has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease, including Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Herein we describe a fragment-based lead discovery effort focused on caspase-6 in its active and zymogen forms. Fragments were identified for procaspase-6 using surface plasmon resonance methods and subsequently shown by X-ray crystallography to bind a putative allosteric site at the dimer interface. A fragment-merging strategy was employed to produce nanomolar-affinity ligands that contact residues in the L2 loop at the dimer interface, significantly stabilizing procaspase-6. Because rearrangement of the L2 loop is required for caspase-6 activation, our results suggest a strategy for the allosteric control of caspase activation with drug-like small molecules. </p>

<p>Regulation of the storage of glycogen, one of the major energy reserves, is of utmost metabolic importance. In eukaryotes, this regulation is accomplished through glucose-6-phosphate levels and protein phosphorylation. Glycogen synthase homologs in bacteria and archaea lack regulation, while the eukaryotic enzymes are inhibited by protein kinase mediated phosphorylation and activated by protein phosphatases and glucose-6-phosphate binding. We determined the crystal structures corresponding to the basal activity state and glucose-6-phosphate activated state of yeast glycogen synthase-2. The enzyme is assembled into an unusual tetramer by an insertion unique to the eukaryotic enzymes, and this subunit interface is rearranged by the binding of glucose-6-phosphate, which frees the active site cleft and facilitates catalysis. Using both mutagenesis and intein-mediated phospho-peptide ligation experiments, we demonstrate that the enzyme's response to glucose-6-phosphate is controlled by Arg583 and Arg587, while four additional arginine residues present within the same regulatory helix regulate the response to phosphorylation.</p>

<p>Cryptosporidium parvum is a potential biowarfare agent, an important AIDS pathogen, and a major cause of diarrhea and malnutrition. No vaccines or effective drug treatment exist to combat Cryptosporidium infection. This parasite relies on inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) to obtain guanine nucleotides, and inhibition of this enzyme blocks parasite proliferation. Here, we report the first crystal structures of CpIMPDH. These structures reveal the structural basis of inhibitor selectivity and suggest a strategy for further optimization. Using this information, we have synthesized low-nanomolar inhibitors that display 10(3) selectivity for the parasite enzyme over human IMPDH2.</p>

<p>Two nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase isoforms (NTPDase1 and NTPDase3) are responsible for the hydrolysis of nucleotides by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. They constitute about 3 % of the total parasite protein. Despite sharing 97 % sequence identity they exhibit opposite ATP versus ADP substrate discrimination ratios. Here we show by mutagenesis that the residues G492/G493 in NTPDase3 and R492/E493 in NTPDase1 are predominantly responsible for the differences in substrate specificity. Crystal structures of NTPDase1 in complexation with analogues of ATP and ADP reveal that the inverted substrate specificity of NTPDase1 relative to NTPDase3 is achieved by switching from the canonical substrate binding mode to a very different alternative one. Instead of being stacked on top of a helix of the C-terminal domain the nucleotide base is positioned in the interdomain space between the side chains of R108 and R492, recruited from both domains. Furthermore, we show that the NTPDase1 substrate specificity is mainly dependent on the presence of the side chain of E493, which causes repositioning of the ribose component of the nucleotide. All in all, binding by the flexible side chains in the alternative binding mode in NTPDase1 allows for equally good positioning of ATP and ADP with increased activity toward ADP relative to what is seen in the case of NTPDase3.</p>

<p>The streptogramin class of antibiotics act to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis, and their semisynthetic derivatives, such as dalfopristin-quinupristin (Synercid), are used to treat serious or life-threatening infections due to multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria. Acquired resistance of the nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium to the group A component of natural and semisynthetic streptogramin mixtures is a prerequisite for the streptogramin resistance phenotype and is mediated by a streptogramin acetyltransferase. The crystal structure of Vat(D), a streptogramin acetyltransferase from a human urinary isolate of E. faecium, has been determined as an apoenzyme and in complex with either acetyl-CoA or virginiamycin M1 and CoA. These structures illustrate the location and arrangement of residues at the active site, and point to His 82 as a residue that may function as a general base. The structural similarity of Vat(D) to the xenobiotic acetyltransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicates similarities in the catalytic mechanism for these enzymes as well as several shared and distinctive antibiotic binding interactions between these enzymes and their respective substrates. These results reveal the molecular basis for a reaction by which Gram-positive cocci acquire resistance to a last resort antibiotic.</p>

<p>For nearly 60 years, the ATP activation and the CTP inhibition of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) has been the textbook example of allosteric regulation. We present kinetic data and five X-ray structures determined in the absence and presence of a Mg(2+) concentration within the physiological range. In the presence of 2 mM divalent cations (Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Zn(2+)), CTP does not significantly inhibit the enzyme, while the allosteric activation by ATP is enhanced. The data suggest that the actual allosteric inhibitor of ATCase in vivo is the combination of CTP, UTP, and a divalent cation, and the actual allosteric activator is a divalent cation with ATP or ATP and GTP. The structural data reveals that two NTPs can bind to each allosteric site with a divalent cation acting as a bridge between the triphosphates. Thus, the regulation of ATCase is far more complex than previously believed and calls many previous studies into question. The X-ray structures reveal that the catalytic chains undergo essentially no alternations; however, several regions of the regulatory chains undergo significant structural changes. Most significant is that the N-terminal region of the regulatory chains exists in different conformations in the allosterically activated and inhibited forms of the enzyme. Here, a new model of allosteric regulation is proposed. </p>

<p>Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, utilizing NADH as a cofactor.

Fragment hits were identified through NMR and SPR screening and optimized into lead compounds with nanomolar binding affinities via fragment linking. Also reported is their modification into cellular active compounds suitable for target validation work.</p>

<p>NADP(+) dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH; EC 1.1.1.42) belongs to a large family of α-hydroxyacid oxidative β-decarboxylases that catalyze similar three-step reactions, with dehydrogenation to an oxaloacid intermediate preceding β-decarboxylation to an enol intermediate followed by tautomerization to the final α-ketone product. A comprehensive view of the induced fit needed for catalysis is revealed on comparing the first "fully closed" crystal structures of a pseudo-Michaelis complex of wild-type Escherichia coli IDH (EcoIDH) and the "fully closed" reaction product complex of the K100M mutant with previously obtained "quasi-closed" and "open" conformations. Conserved catalytic residues, binding the nicotinamide ring of NADP(+) and the metal-bound substrate, move as rigid bodies during domain closure by a hinge motion that spans the central β-sheet in each monomer. Interactions established between Thr105 and Ser113, which flank the "phosphorylation loop", and the nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety of NADP(+) establish productive coenzyme binding. Electrostatic interactions of a Lys100-Leu103-Asn115-Glu336 tetrad play a pivotal role in assembling a catalytically competent active site. As predicted, Lys230* is positioned to deprotonate/reprotonate the α-hydroxyl in both reaction steps and Tyr160 moves into position to protonate C3 following β-decarboxylation. A proton relay from the catalytic triad Tyr160-Asp307-Lys230* connects the α-hydroxyl of isocitrate to the bulk solvent to complete the picture of the catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate by the FMN oxidation of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate forming FMNH(2) and H(2)O(2). Recent studies have shown that in addition to the active site, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase contains a non-catalytic site that binds pyridoxal 5'-phosphate tightly. The crystal structure of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from E. coli with one or two molecules of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate bound to each monomer has been determined to 2.0 A resolution. One of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate molecules is clearly bound at the active site with the aldehyde at C4' of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate near N5 of the bound FMN. A protein conformational change has occurred that partially closes the active site. The orientation of the bound pyridoxal 5'-phosphate suggests that the enzyme catalyzes a hydride ion transfer between C4' of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and N5 of FMN. When the crystals are soaked with excess pyridoxal 5'-phosphate an additional molecule of this cofactor is also bound about 11 A from the active site. A possible tunnel exists between the two sites so that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate formed at the active site may transfer to the non-catalytic site without passing though the solvent.</p>

<p>Isopentenyl-diphosphate (IPP):dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. The mechanism of the isomerization reaction involves protonation of the unactivated carbon-carbon double bond in the substrate, but identity of the acidic moiety providing the proton is still not clear. Multiple sequence alignments and geometrical features observed in crystal structures of complexes with IPP isomerase suggest that Tyr-104 could play an important role during catalysis. A series of mutants was constructed by directed mutagenesis and characterized by enzymology. Crystallographic and thermal denaturation data for Y104A and Y104F mutants were obtained. Those data demonstrate the importance of residue Tyr-104 for proper folding of Escherichia coli type I IPP isomerase.</p>

Notably, the tumor-derived IDH1 mutations identified so far mainly occur at Arg132, and mutation R132H is the most prevalent one. This mutation impairs the oxidative IDH activity of the enzyme, but renders a new reduction function of converting α-ketoglutarate (αKG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate. Here, we report the structures of the R132H mutant IDH1 with and without isocitrate (ICT) bound. The structural data together with mutagenesis and biochemical data reveal a previously undefined initial ICT-binding state and demonstrate that IDH activity requires a conformational change to a closed pre-transition state. Arg132 plays multiple functional roles in the catalytic reaction; in particular, the R132H mutation hinders the conformational changes from the initial ICT-binding state to the pre-transition state, leading to the impairment of the IDH activity. Our results describe for the first time that there is an intermediate conformation that corresponds to an initial ICT-binding state and that the R132H mutation can trap the enzyme in this conformation, therefore shedding light on the molecular mechanism of the "off switch" of the potentially tumor-suppressive IDH activity. Furthermore, we proved the necessity of Tyr139 for the gained αKG reduction activity and propose that Tyr139 may play a vital role by compensating the increased negative charge on the C2 atom of αKG during the transfer of a hydride anion from NADPH to αKG, which provides new insights into the mechanism of the "on switch" of the hypothetically oncogenic reduction activity of IDH1 by this mutation.</p>

<p>To reduce peroxides, peroxiredoxins (Prxs) require a key "peroxidatic" Cys that, in a substrate-ready fully folded (FF) conformation, is oxidized to sulfenic acid and then, after a local unfolding (LU) of the active site, forms a disulfide bond with a second "resolving" Cys. For Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C (StAhpC) and some other Prxs, the FF structure is only known for a peroxidatic Cys→Ser variant, which may not accurately represent the wild-type enzyme. Here, we obtain the structure of authentic reduced wild-type StAhpC by dithiothreitol treatment of disulfide form crystals that fortuitously accommodate both the LU and FF conformations. The unique environment of one molecule in the crystal reveals a thermodynamic linkage between the folding of the active site loop and C-terminal regions, and comparisons with the Ser variant show structural and mobility differences from which we infer that the Cys→Ser mutation stabilizes the FF active site. A structure for the C165A variant (a resolving Cys to Ala mutant) in the same crystal form reveals that this mutation destabilizes the folding of the C-terminal region. These structures prove that subtle modifications to Prx structures can substantially influence enzymatic properties. We also present a simple thermodynamic framework for understanding the various mixtures of FF and LU conformations seen in these structures. On the basis of this framework, we rationalize how physiologically relevant regulatory post-translational modifications may modulate activity, and we propose a nonconventional strategy for designing selective Prx inhibitors. </p>

<p>Binding ATP to tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) in a catalytically competent configuration for amino acid activation destabilizes the enzyme structure prior to forming the transition state. This conclusion follows from monitoring the titration of TrpRS with ATP by small angle solution X-ray scattering, enzyme activity, and crystal structures. ATP induces a significantly smaller radius of gyration at pH=7 with a transition midpoint at approximately 8mM. A non-reciprocal dependence of Trp and ATP dissociation constants on concentrations of the second substrate show that Trp binding enhances affinity for ATP, while the affinity for Trp falls with the square of the [ATP] over the same concentration range ( approximately 5mM) that induces the more compact conformation. Two distinct TrpRS:ATP structures have been solved, a high-affinity complex grown with 1mM ATP and a low-affinity complex grown at 10mM ATP. The former is isomorphous with unliganded TrpRS and the Trp complex from monoclinic crystals. Reacting groups of the two individually-bound substrates are separated by 6.7A. Although it lacks tryptophan, the low-affinity complex has a closed conformation similar to that observed in the presence of both ATP and Trp analogs such as indolmycin, and resembles a complex previously postulated to form in the closely-related TyrRS upon induced-fit active-site assembly, just prior to catalysis. Titration of TrpRS with ATP therefore successively produces structurally distinct high- and low-affinity ATP-bound states. The higher quality X-ray data for the closed ATP complex (2.2A) provide new structural details likely related to catalysis, including an extension of the KMSKS loop that engages the second lysine and serine residues, K195 and S196, with the alpha and gamma-phosphates; interactions of the K111 side-chain with the gamma-phosphate; and a water molecule bridging the consensus sequence residue T15 to the beta-phosphate. Induced-fit therefore strengthens active-site interactions with ATP, substantially intensifying the interaction of the KMSKS loop with the leaving PP(i) group. Formation of this conformation in the absence of a Trp analog implies that ATP is a key allosteric effector for TrpRS. The paradoxical requirement for high [ATP] implies that Gibbs binding free energy is stored in an unfavorable protein conformation and can then be recovered for useful purposes, including catalysis in the case of TrpRS.</p>

<p>CTX-M enzymes are an emerging group of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) that hydrolyze not only the penicillins but also the first-, second-, and third-generation cephalosporins. Although they have become the most frequently observed ESBLs in certain areas, there are few effective inhibitors and relatively little is known about their detailed mechanism. Here we describe the X-ray crystal structures of CTX-M enzymes in complex with different transition-state analogues and beta-lactam inhibitors, representing the enzyme as it progresses from its acylation transition state to its acyl enzyme complex to the deacylation transition state. As the enzyme moves along this reaction coordinate, two key catalytic residues, Lys73 and Glu166, change conformations, tracking the state of the reaction. Unexpectedly, the acyl enzyme complex with the beta-lactam inhibitor cefoxitin still has the catalytic water bound; this water had been predicted to be displaced by the unusual 7alpha-methoxy of the inhibitor. Instead, the 7alpha-group appears to inhibit by preventing the formation of the deacylation transition state through steric hindrance. From an inhibitor design standpoint, we note that the best of the reversible inhibitors, a ceftazidime-like boronic acid compound, binds to CTX-M-16 with a K(i) value of 4 nM. When used together in cell culture, this inhibitor reversed cefotaxime resistance in CTX-M-producing bacteria. The structure of its complex with CTX-M enzyme and the structural view of the reaction coordinate described here provide templates for inhibitor design and intervention to combat this family of antibiotic resistance enzymes.</p>

<p>Yellow fever virus (YFV), a member of the Flavivirus genus, has a plus-sense RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein. Viral protein NS3 includes a protease and a helicase that are essential to virus replication and to RNA capping. The 1.8-A crystal structure of the helicase region of the YFV NS3 protein includes residues 187 to 623. Two familiar helicase domains bind nucleotide in a triphosphate pocket without base recognition, providing a site for nonspecific hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates and RNA triphosphate. The third, C-terminal domain has a unique structure and is proposed to function in RNA and protein recognition. The organization of the three domains indicates that cleavage of the viral polyprotein NS3-NS4A junction occurs in trans.</p>

<p>The OB-fold is a small, versatile single-domain protein binding module that occurs in all forms of life, where it binds protein, carbohydrate, nucleic acid and small-molecule ligands. We have exploited this natural plasticity to engineer a new class of non-immunoglobulin alternatives to antibodies with unique structural and biophysical characteristics. We present here the engineering of the OB-fold anticodon recognition domain from aspartyl tRNA synthetase taken from the thermophile Pyrobaculum aerophilum. For this single-domain scaffold we have coined the term OBody. Starting from a naïve combinatorial library, we engineered an OBody with 3 nM affinity for hen egg-white lysozyme, by optimising the affinity of a naïve OBody 11,700-fold over several affinity maturation steps, using phage display. At each maturation step a crystal structure of the engineered OBody in complex with hen egg-white lysozyme was determined, showing binding elements in atomic detail. These structures have given us an unprecedented insight into the directed evolution of affinity for a single antigen on the molecular scale. The engineered OBodies retain the high thermal stability of the parental OB-fold despite mutation of up to 22% of their residues. They can be expressed in soluble form and also purified from bacteria at high yields. They also lack disulfide bonds. These data demonstrate the potential of OBodies as a new scaffold for the engineering of specific binding reagents and provide a platform for further development of future OBody-based applications. </p>

<p>Glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidases play roles in many processes in plants, such as chemical defense, alkaloid metabolism, hydrolysis of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides, phytohormone regulation, and lignification. However, the functions of most of the 34 GH1 gene products in rice (Oryza sativa) are unknown. Os3BGlu6, a rice beta-glucosidase representing a previously uncharacterized phylogenetic cluster of GH1, was produced in recombinant Escherichia coli. Os3BGlu6 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-beta-d-fucoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 67 mm(-1) s(-1)), pNP-beta-d-glucoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 6.2 mm(-1) s(-1)), and pNP-beta-d-galactoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 1.6 mm(-1)s(-1)) efficiently but had little activity toward other pNP glycosides. It also had high activity toward n-octyl-beta-d-glucoside and beta-(1--&gt;3)- and beta-(1--&gt;2)-linked disaccharides and was able to hydrolyze apigenin beta-glucoside and several other natural glycosides. Crystal structures of Os3BGlu6 and its complexes with a covalent intermediate, 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucoside, and a nonhydrolyzable substrate analog, n-octyl-beta-d-thioglucopyranoside, were solved at 1.83, 1.81, and 1.80 A resolution, respectively. The position of the covalently trapped 2-F-glucosyl residue in the enzyme was similar to that in a 2-F-glucosyl intermediate complex of Os3BGlu7 (rice BGlu1). The side chain of methionine-251 in the mouth of the active site appeared to block the binding of extended beta-(1--&gt;4)-linked oligosaccharides and interact with the hydrophobic aglycone of n-octyl-beta-d-thioglucopyranoside. This correlates with the preference of Os3BGlu6 for short oligosaccharides and hydrophobic glycosides.</p>

<p>The senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30), which is also called regucalcin, exhibits gluconolactonase (GNL) activity. Biochemical and biological analyses revealed that SMP30/GNL catalyzes formation of the γ-lactone-ring of L-gulonate in the ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathway. The molecular basis of the γ-lactone formation, however, remains elusive due to the lack of structural information on SMP30/GNL in complex with its substrate. Here, we report the crystal structures of mouse SMP30/GNL and its complex with xylitol, a substrate analogue, and those with 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol and D-glucose, product analogues. Comparison of the crystal structure of mouse SMP30/GNL with other related enzymes has revealed unique characteristics of mouse SMP30/GNL. First, the substrate-binding pocket of mouse SMP30/GNL is designed to specifically recognize monosaccharide molecules. The divalent metal ion in the active site and polar residues lining the substrate-binding cavity interact with hydroxyl groups of substrate/product analogues. Second, in mouse SMP30/GNL, a lid loop covering the substrate-binding cavity seems to hamper the binding of L-gulonate in an extended (or all-trans) conformation; L-gulonate seems to bind to the active site in a folded conformation. In contrast, the substrate-binding cavities of the other related enzymes are open to the solvent and do not have a cover. This structural feature of mouse SMP30/GNL seems to facilitate the γ-lactone-ring formation.</p>

<p>Aldh1l1, also known as 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH), contains the carboxy-terminal domain (Ct-FDH), which is a structural and functional homolog of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). This domain is capable of catalyzing the NADP(+)-dependent oxidation of short chain aldehydes to their corresponding acids, and similar to most ALDHs it has two conserved catalytic residues, Cys707 and Glu673. Previously, we demonstrated that in the Ct-FDH mechanism these residues define the conformation of the bound coenzyme and the affinity of its interaction with the protein. Specifically, the replacement of Cys707 with an alanine resulted in the enzyme lacking the ability to differentiate between the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. We suggested that this was due to the loss of a covalent bond between the cysteine and the C4N atom of nicotinamide ring of NADP(+) formed during Ct-FDH catalysis. To obtain further insight into the functional significance of the covalent bond between Cys707 and the coenzyme, and the overall role of the two catalytic residues in the coenzyme binding and positioning, we have now solved crystal structures of Ct-FDH in the complex with thio-NADP(+) and the complexes of the C707S mutant with NADP(+) and NADPH. This study has allowed us to trap the coenzyme in the contracted conformation, which provided a snapshot of the conformational processing of the coenzyme during the transition from oxidized to reduced form. Overall, the results of this study further support the previously proposed mechanism by which Cys707 helps to differentiate between the oxidized and reduced coenzyme during ALDH catalysis.</p>

<p>Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2); EC 3.1.1.4) is a key enzyme involved in the production of proinflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids. The binding of the substrate to PLA(2) occurs through a well-formed hydrophobic channel. To determine the viability of PLA(2) as a target molecule for the structure-based drug design against inflammation, arthritis, and rheumatism, the crystal structure of the complex of PLA(2) with a known anti-inflammatory compound oxyphenbutazone (OPB), which has been determined at 1.6 A resolution. The structure has been refined to an R factor of 0.209. The structure contains 1 molecule each of PLA(2) and OPB with 2 sulfate ions and 111 water molecules. The binding studies using surface plasmon resonance show that OPB binds to PLA(2) with a dissociation constant of 6.4 x 10(-8) M. The structure determination has revealed the presence of an OPB molecule at the binding site of PLA(2). It fits well in the binding region, thus displaying a high level of complementarity. The structure also indicates that OPB works as a competitive inhibitor. A large number of hydrophobic interactions between the enzyme and the OPB molecule have been observed. The hydrophobic interactions involving residues Tyr(52) and Lys(69) with OPB are particularly noteworthy. Other residues of the hydrophobic channel such as Leu(3), Phe(5), Met(8), Ile(9), and Ala(18) are also interacting extensively with the inhibitor. The crystal structure clearly reveals that the binding of OPB to PLA(2) is specific in nature and possibly suggests that the basis of its anti-inflammatory effects may be due to its binding to PLA(2) as well.</p>

<p>beta-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabG) is a key component in the type II fatty acid synthase system. The structures of Escherichia coli FabG and the FabG[Y151F] mutant in binary complexes with NADP(H) reveal that mechanistically important conformational changes accompany cofactor binding. The active site Ser-Tyr-Lys triad is repositioned into a catalytically competent constellation, and a hydrogen bonded network consisting of ribose hydroxyls, the Ser-Tyr-Lys triad, and four water molecules creates a proton wire to replenish the tyrosine proton donated during catalysis. Also, a disordered loop in FabG forms a substructure in the complex that shapes the entrance to the active site. A key observation is that the nicotinamide portion of the cofactor is disordered in the FabG[Y151F].NADP(H) complex, and Tyr151 appears to be necessary for high-affinity cofactor binding. Biochemical data confirm that FabG[Y151F] is defective in NADPH binding. Finally, structural changes consistent with the observed negative cooperativity of FabG are described.</p>

<p>The structure of the antifungal drug 5-hydroxy-4-oxonorvaline (HON) in complex with its target homoserine dehydrogenase (HSD) has been determined by X-ray diffraction to 2.6 A resolution. HON shows potent in vitro and in vivo activity against various fungal pathogens despite its weak (2 mM) affinity for HSD in the steady state. The structure together with structure-activity relationship studies, mass spectrometry experiments, and spectroscopic data reveals that the molecular mechanism of antifungal action conferred by HON involves enzyme-dependent formation of a covalent adduct between C4 of the nicotinamide ring of NAD(+) and C5 of HON. Furthermore, novel interactions are involved in stabilizing the (HON*NAD)-adduct, which are not observed in the enzyme's ternary complex structure. These findings clarify the apparent paradox of the potent antifungal actions of HON given its weak steady-state inhibition characteristics.</p>

<p>As a mechanism-based inactivator of PLP-enzymes, (S)-4-amino-4,5-dihydro-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (SADTA) was cocrystallized with Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (l-AspAT) at a series of pH values ranging from 6 to 8. Five structural models with high resolution (1.4-1.85 A) were obtained for l-AspAT-SADTA complexes at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. Electron densities of the models showed that two different adducts had formed in the active sites. One adduct was formed from SADTA covalently linked to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) while the other adduct was formed with the inhibitor covalently linked to Lysine246,1 the active site lysine. Moreover, there is a strong indication based on the electron densities that the occurrence of the two adducts is pH dependent. We conclude that SADTA inactivates l-AspAT via two different mechanisms based on the binding direction of the inactivator. Additionally, the structural models also show pH dependence of the protein structure itself, which provided detailed mechanistic implications for l-AspAT.</p>

<p>Pyrrolysine (Pyl), the 22nd natural amino acid and genetically encoded by UAG, becomes attached to its cognate tRNA by pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS). We have determined three crystal structures of the Methanosarcina mazei PylRS complexed with either AMP-PNP, Pyl-AMP plus pyrophosphate, or the Pyl analogue N-epsilon-[(cylopentyloxy)carbonyl]-L-lysine plus ATP. The structures reveal that PylRS utilizes a deep hydrophobic pocket for recognition of the Pyl side chain. A comparison of these structures with previously determined class II tRNA synthetase complexes illustrates that different substrate specificities derive from changes in a small number of residues that form the substrate side-chain-binding pocket. The knowledge of these structures allowed the placement of PylRS in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) tree as the last known synthetase that evolved for genetic code expansion, as well as the finding that Pyl arose before the last universal common ancestral state. The PylRS structure provides an excellent framework for designing new aaRSs with altered amino acid specificity.</p>

<p>Structure-activity correlations have been employed previously in the mechanistic interpretation of TTQ-dependent amine dehydrogenases using a series of para-substituted benzylamines. However, by combining the use of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and crystallographic analysis, in conjunction with structure-reactivity correlation studies, we show that para-substituted benzylamines are poor reactivity probes for TTQ-dependent aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH). Stopped-flow kinetic studies of the reductive half-reaction, with para-substituted benzylamines and their dideuterated counterparts, demonstrate that C-H or C-D bond breakage is not fully rate limiting (KIEs approximately unity). Contrary to previous reports, Hammett plots exhibit a poor correlation of structure-reactivity data with electronic substituent effects for para-substituted benzylamines and phenylethylamines. Crystallographic studies of enzyme-substrate complexes reveal that the observed structure-reactivity correlations are not attributed to distinct binding modes for para-substituted benzylamines in the active site, although two binding sites for p-nitrobenzylamine are identified. We identify structural rearrangements, prior to the H-transfer step, which are likely to limit the rate of TTQ reduction by benzylamines. This work emphasizes (i) the need for caution when applying structure-activity correlations to enzyme-catalyzed reactions and (ii) the added benefit of using both isotope effects and structural analysis, in conjunction with structure-reactivity relationships, to study chemical steps in enzyme reaction cycles.</p>

<p>An extensive structural manifold of short hydrogen bond-mediated, active site-directed, serine protease inhibition motifs is revealed in a set of over 300 crystal structures involving a large suite of small molecule inhibitors (2-(2-phenol)-indoles and 2-(2-phenol)-benzimidazoles) determined over a wide range of pH (3.5-11.4). The active site hydrogen-bonding mode was found to vary markedly with pH, with the steric and electronic properties of the inhibitor, and with the type of protease (trypsin, thrombin or urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA)). The pH dependence of the active site hydrogen-bonding motif is often intricate, constituting a distinct fingerprint of each complex. Isosteric replacements or minor substitutions within the inhibitor that modulate the pK(a) of the phenol hydroxyl involved in short hydrogen bonding, or that affect steric interactions distal to the active site, can significantly shift the pH-dependent structural profile characteristic of the parent scaffold, or produce active site-binding motifs unique to the bound analog. Ionization equilibria at the active site associated with inhibitor binding are probed in a series of the protease-inhibitor complexes through analysis of the pH dependence of the structure and environment of the active site-binding groups involved in short hydrogen bond arrays. Structures determined at high pH (&gt;11), suggest that the pK(a) of His57 is dramatically elevated, to a value as high as approximately 11 in certain complexes. K(i) values involving uPA and trypsin determined as a function of pH for a set of inhibitors show pronounced parabolic pH dependence, the pH for optimal inhibition governed by the pK(a) of the inhibitor phenol involved in short hydrogen bonds. Comparison of structures of trypsin, thrombin and uPA, each bound by the same inhibitor, highlights important structural variations in the S1 and active sites accessible for engineering notable selectivity into remarkably small molecules with low nanomolar K(i) values.</p>

<p>10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes an NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase reaction resulting in conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2. This reaction is a result of the concerted action of two catalytic domains of FDH, the amino-terminal hydrolase domain and the carboxyl-terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase domain. In addition to participation in the overall FDH mechanism, the C-terminal domain is capable of NADP+-dependent oxidation of short chain aldehydes to their corresponding acids. We have determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of FDH and its complexes with oxidized and reduced forms of NADP. Compared to other members of the ALDH family, FDH demonstrates a new mode of binding of the 2'-phosphate group of NADP via a water-mediated contact with Gln600 that may contribute to the specificity of the enzyme for NADP over NAD. The structures also suggest how Glu673 can act as a general base in both acylation and deacylation steps of the reaction. In the apo structure, the general base Glu673 is positioned optimally for proton abstraction from the sulfur atom of Cys707. Upon binding of NADP+, the side chain of Glu673 is displaced from the active site by the nicotinamide ring and contacts a chain of highly ordered water molecules that may represent a pathway for translocation of the abstracted proton from Glu673 to the solvent. When reduced, the nicotinamide ring of NADP is displaced from the active site, restoring the contact between Cys707 and Glu673 and allowing the latter to activate the hydrolytic water molecule in deacylation.</p>

<p>An extensive structural manifold of short hydrogen bond-mediated, active site-directed, serine protease inhibition motifs is revealed in a set of over 300 crystal structures involving a large suite of small molecule inhibitors (2-(2-phenol)-indoles and 2-(2-phenol)-benzimidazoles) determined over a wide range of pH (3.5-11.4). The active site hydrogen-bonding mode was found to vary markedly with pH, with the steric and electronic properties of the inhibitor, and with the type of protease (trypsin, thrombin or urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA)). The pH dependence of the active site hydrogen-bonding motif is often intricate, constituting a distinct fingerprint of each complex. Isosteric replacements or minor substitutions within the inhibitor that modulate the pK(a) of the phenol hydroxyl involved in short hydrogen bonding, or that affect steric interactions distal to the active site, can significantly shift the pH-dependent structural profile characteristic of the parent scaffold, or produce active site-binding motifs unique to the bound analog. Ionization equilibria at the active site associated with inhibitor binding are probed in a series of the protease-inhibitor complexes through analysis of the pH dependence of the structure and environment of the active site-binding groups involved in short hydrogen bond arrays. Structures determined at high pH (&gt;11), suggest that the pK(a) of His57 is dramatically elevated, to a value as high as approximately 11 in certain complexes.

<p>10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes an NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase reaction resulting in conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2. This reaction is a result of the concerted action of two catalytic domains of FDH, the amino-terminal hydrolase domain and the carboxyl-terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase domain. In addition to participation in the overall FDH mechanism, the C-terminal domain is capable of NADP+-dependent oxidation of short chain aldehydes to their corresponding acids. We have determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of FDH and its complexes with oxidized and reduced forms of NADP. Compared to other members of the ALDH family, FDH demonstrates a new mode of binding of the 2'-phosphate group of NADP via a water-mediated contact with Gln600 that may contribute to the specificity of the enzyme for NADP over NAD. The structures also suggest how Glu673 can act as a general base in both acylation and deacylation steps of the reaction. In the apo structure, the general base Glu673 is positioned optimally for proton abstraction from the sulfur atom of Cys707. Upon binding of NADP+, the side chain of Glu673 is displaced from the active site by the nicotinamide ring and contacts a chain of highly ordered water molecules that may represent a pathway for translocation of the abstracted proton from Glu673 to the solvent. When reduced, the nicotinamide ring of NADP is displaced from the active site, restoring the contact between Cys707 and Glu673 and allowing the latter to activate the hydrolytic water molecule in deacylation.</p>

<p>The serine protease chymase (EC = 3.4.21.39) is expressed in the secretory granules of mast cells, which are important in allergic reactions. Fynomers, which are binding proteins derived from the Fyn SH3 domain, were generated against human chymase to produce binding partners to facilitate crystallization, structure determination and structure-based drug discovery, and to provide inhibitors of chymase for therapeutic applications. The best Fynomer was found to bind chymase with a KD of 0.9 nM and koff of 6.6x10 (-4)  s (-1) , and to selectively inhibit chymase activity with an IC 50 value of 2 nM. Three different Fynomers were co-crystallized with chymase in 6 different crystal forms overall, with diffraction quality in the range of 2.25 to 1.4 Å resolution, which is suitable for drug design efforts. The X-ray structures show that all Fynomers bind to the active site of chymase. The conserved residues Arg15-Trp16-Thr17 in the RT-loop of the chymase binding Fynomers provide a tight interaction, with Trp16 pointing deep into the S1 pocket of chymase. These results confirm the suitability of Fynomers as research tools to facilitate protein crystallization, as well as for the development of assays to investigate the biological mechanism of targets. Finally, their highly specific inhibitory activity and favorable molecular properties support the use of Fynomers as potential therapeutic agents.</p>

<p>Kinetic measurements of enzyme activity indicate that type I pantothenate kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has dual substrate specificity for ATP and GTP, unlike the enzyme from Escherichia coli, which shows a higher specificity for ATP. A molecular explanation for the difference in the specificities of the two homologous enzymes is provided by the crystal structures of the complexes of the M. tuberculosis enzyme with (1) GMPPCP and pantothenate, (2) GDP and phosphopantothenate, (3) GDP, (4) GDP and pantothenate, (5) AMPPCP, and (6) GMPPCP, reported here, and the structures of the complexes of the two enzymes involving coenzyme A and different adenyl nucleotides reported earlier. The explanation is substantially based on two critical substitutions in the amino acid sequence and the local conformational change resulting from them. The structures also provide a rationale for the movement of ligands during the action of the mycobacterial enzyme. Dual specificity of the type exhibited by this enzyme is rare. The change in locations of ligands during action, observed in the case of the M. tuberculosis enzyme, is unusual, so is the striking difference between two homologous enzymes in the geometry of the binding site, locations of ligands, and specificity. Furthermore, the dual specificity of the mycobacterial enzyme appears to have been caused by a biological necessity.</p>

<p>Kinetics, thermodynamics and structural aspects of human alpha-thrombin (thrombin) inhibition by newly synthesized low molecular weight derivatives of alpha-azalysine have been investigated. The thrombin catalyzed hydrolysis of N-ethoxycarbonyl-D-Phe-Pro-alpha-azaLys p-nitrophenyl ester (Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-azaLys-ONp) and N-carbobenzoxy-Pro-alpha-azaLys p-nitrophenyl ester (Cbz-Pro-azaLys-ONp) was investigated at pH 6.2 and 21.0 degrees C, and analyzed in parallel with that of N-alpha-(N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl)-alpha-azalysine p-nitrophenyl ester (Dmc-azaLys-ONp). Decarboxylation following the enzymatic hydrolysis of these p-nitrophenyl esters gave the corresponding 1-peptidyl-2(4-aminobutyl) hydrazines (peptidyl-Abh) showing properties of thrombin competitive inhibitors. Therefore, thermodynamics for the reversible binding of D-Phe-Pro-Abh, Cbz-Pro-Abh and Dmc-Abh to thrombin was examined. These results are consistent with the minimum four-step catalytic mechanism for product inhibition of serine proteinases. Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-azaLys-ONp and Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-Abh display a sub-micromolar affinity for thrombin together with a high selectivity versus homologous plasmatic and pancreatic serine proteinases acting on cationic substrates. The three-dimensional structures of the reversible non-covalent thrombin:Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-Abh and thrombin:Cbz-Pro-Abh complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.0 A resolution (R-factor = 0.169 and 0.179, respectively), and analyzed in parallel with that of the thrombin:Dmc-azaLys acyl-enzyme adduct. Both Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-Abh and Cbz-Pro-Abh competitive inhibitors are accommodated in the thrombin active center, spanning the region between the aryl binding site and the S1 primary specificity subsite.</p>

<p>A novel flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase was identified recently as an essential gene in many archaebacteria and some pathogenic eubacteria. This enzyme, ThyX, is a potential antibacterial drug target, since humans and most eukaryotes lack the thyX gene and depend upon the conventional thymidylate synthase (TS) for their dTMP requirements. We have cloned and overexpressed the thyX gene (Rv2754c) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Escherichia coli. The M.tuberculosis ThyX (MtbThyX) enzyme complements the E.coli chi2913 strain that lacks its conventional TS activity. The crystal structure of the homotetrameric MtbThyX was determined in the presence of the cofactor FAD and the substrate analog, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (BrdUMP). In the active site, which is formed by three monomers, FAD is bound in an extended conformation with the adenosine ring in a deep pocket and BrdUMP in a closed conformation near the isoalloxazine ring. Structure-based mutational studies have revealed a critical role played by residues Lys165 and Arg168 in ThyX activity, possibly by governing access to the carbon atom to be methylated of a totally buried substrate dUMP.</p>

<p>Regulation of thrombin activity is critical for haemostasis and the prevention of thrombosis. Thrombin has several procoagulant substrates, including fibrinogen and platelet receptors, and essential cofactors for stimulating its own formation. However, thrombin is also capable of serving an anticoagulant function by activating protein C. The specificity of thrombin is primarily regulated by binding to the cofactor TM (thrombomodulin), but co-ordination of Na+ can also affect thrombin activity. The Na+-free form is often referred to as 'slow' because of reduced rates of cleavage of procoagulant substrates, but the slow form is still capable of rapid activation of protein C in the presence of TM. The molecular basis of the slow proteolytic activity of thrombin has remained elusive, in spite of two decades of solution studies and many published crystallographic structures. In the present paper, we report the first structure of wild-type unliganded human thrombin grown in the absence of co-ordinating Na+. The Na+-binding site is observed in a highly ordered position 6 A (1 A=0.1 nm) removed from that seen in the Na+-bound state. The movement of the Na+ loop results in non-catalytic hydrogen-bonding in the active site and blocking of the S1 and S2 substrate-binding pockets. Similar, if more dramatic, changes were observed in a previous structure of the constitutively slow thrombin variant E217K. The slow behaviour of thrombin in solutions devoid of Na+ can now be understood in terms of an equilibrium between an inert species, represented by the crystal structure described in the present paper, and an active form, where the addition of Na+ populates the active state.</p>

<p>Sensor histidine kinases of two-component signal-transduction systems are essential for bacteria to adapt to variable environmental conditions. However, despite their prevalence, it is not well understood how extracellular signals such as ligand binding regulate the activity of these sensor kinases. CitA is the sensor histidine kinase in Klebsiella pneumoniae that regulates the transport and anaerobic metabolism of citrate in response to its extracellular concentration. We report here the X-ray structures of the periplasmic sensor domain of CitA in the citrate-free and citrate-bound states. A comparison of the two structures shows that ligand binding causes a considerable contraction of the sensor domain. This contraction may represent the molecular switch that activates transmembrane signaling in the receptor.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of human aldose reductase in complex with citrate has been determined to a resolution of 0.82 A. The difference electron density for H atoms unequivocally shows that the cofactor is in the oxidized state corresponding to the situation after the catalytic event has occurred. A citrate molecule bound to the active site has been modelled in two different conformations. These two conformations correlate with a fully closed and a partially open conformation of the so-called safety-belt loop (Gly213-Ser226). The open conformation is observed for the first time with the cofactor bound to the protein and may be related to the initial phase of the opening of the safety belt. The structure suggests that after the catalytic event, a rearrangement of a bound ligand can trigger the opening of the safety-belt loop, thus initiating the release of the oxidized cofactor.</p>

<p>Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an erythrocyte-specific enzyme catalyzing a series of intermolecular phosphoryl group transfer reactions. Its main function is to synthesize 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the allosteric effector of hemoglobin. In this paper, we directly observed real-time motion of the enzyme active site and the substrate during phosphoryl transfer. A series of high resolution crystal structures of human bisphosphoglycerate mutase co-crystallized with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, representing different time points in the phosphoryl transfer reaction, were solved. These structures not only clarify the argument concerning the substrate binding mode for this enzyme family but also depict the entire process of the key histidine phosphorylation as a "slow movie". It was observed that the enzyme conformation continuously changed during the different states of the reaction. These results provide direct evidence for an "in line" phosphoryl transfer mechanism, and the roles of some key residues in the phosphoryl transfer process are identified.</p>

<p>We report a highly reproducible method to crystallize the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3), allowing structure refinement to a 1.79-Å resolution and revealing amino acids not seen previously. We also present a DENV-3 polymerase/inhibitor cocrystal structure at a 2.1-Å resolution. The inhibitor binds to the RdRp as a dimer and causes conformational changes in the protein. The improved crystallization conditions and new structural information should accelerate structure-based drug discovery.</p>

<p>The biological role of manganese (Mn(2+)) has been a long-standing puzzle, since at low concentrations it activates several polymerases whilst at higher concentrations it inhibits. Viral RNA polymerases possess a common architecture, reminiscent of a closed right hand. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of bacteriophage 6 is one of the best understood examples of this important class of polymerases. We have probed the role of Mn(2+) by biochemical, biophysical and structural analyses of the wild-type enzyme and of a mutant form with an altered Mn(2+)-binding site (E491 to Q). The E491Q mutant has much reduced affinity for Mn(2+), reduced RNA binding and a compromised elongation rate. Loss of Mn(2+) binding structurally stabilizes the enzyme. These data and a re-examination of the structures of other viral RNA polymerases clarify the role of manganese in the activation of polymerization: Mn(2+) coordination of a catalytic aspartate is necessary to allow the active site to properly engage with the triphosphates of the incoming NTPs. The structural flexibility caused by Mn(2+) is also important for the enzyme dynamics, explaining the requirement for manganese throughout RNA polymerization.</p>

<p>Together with the NS5 polymerase, the NS3 helicase has a pivotal function in flavivirus RNA replication and constitutes an important drug target. We captured the dengue virus NS3 helicase at several stages along the catalytic pathway including bound to single-stranded (ss) RNA, to an ATP analogue, to a transition-state analogue and to ATP hydrolysis products. RNA recognition appears largely sequence independent in a way remarkably similar to eukaryotic DEAD box proteins Vasa and eIF4AIII. On ssRNA binding, the NS3 enzyme switches to a catalytic-competent state imparted by an inward movement of the P-loop, interdomain closure and a change in the divalent metal coordination shell, providing a structural basis for RNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. These structures demonstrate for the first time large quaternary changes in the flaviviridae helicase, identify the catalytic water molecule and point to a beta-hairpin that protrudes from subdomain 2, as a critical element for dsRNA unwinding. They also suggest how NS3 could exert an effect as an RNA-anchoring device and thus participate both in flavivirus RNA replication and assembly.</p>

<p>Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) is a key enzyme in the nucleoside salvage pathway that is also required for the activation of several anticancer and antiviral nucleoside analog prodrugs. Additionally, dCK has been implicated in immune disorders and has been found to be overexpressed in several cancers. To allow the probing and modulation of dCK activity, a new class of small-molecule inhibitors of the enzyme were developed. Here, the structural characterization of four of these inhibitors in complex with human dCK is presented. The structures reveal that the compounds occupy the nucleoside-binding site and bind to the open form of dCK. Surprisingly, a slight variation in the nature of the substituent at the 5-position of the thiazole ring governs whether the active site of the enzyme is occupied by one or two inhibitor molecules. Moreover, this substituent plays a critical role in determining the affinity, improving it from &gt;700 to 1.5 nM in the best binder. These structures lay the groundwork for future modifications that would result in even tighter binding and the correct placement of moieties that confer favorable pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties. </p>

<p>The homologous human ABO(H) A and B blood group glycosyltransferases GTA and GTB have two mobile polypeptide loops surrounding their active sites that serve to allow substrate access and product egress and to recognize and sequester substrates for catalysis. Previous studies have established that these enzymes can move from the "open" state to the "semi-closed" then "closed" states in response to addition of a substrate. The contribution of electrostatic interactions to these conformational changes has now been demonstrated by the determination at various pH of the structures of GTA, GTB and the chimeric enzyme ABBA. At near-neutral pH, GTA displays the closed state in which both mobile loops order around the active site, whereas ABBA and GTB display the open state. At low pH, the apparent protonation of the DXD motif in GTA leads to the expulsion of the donor analog to yield the open state, whereas at high pH, both ABBA and GTB form the semi-closed state in which the first mobile loop becomes an ordered α-helix. Step-wise deprotonation of GTB in increments of 0.5 between pH 6.5 and 10.0 shows that helix ordering is gradual, which indicates that the formation of the semi-closed state is dependent on electrostatic forces consistent with the binding of substrate. Spectropolarimetric studies of the corresponding stand-alone peptide in solution reveal no tendency toward helix formation from pH 7.0 to 10.0, which shows that pH-dependent stability is a product of the larger protein environment and underlines the importance of substrate in active site ordering. </p>

<p>Both hospital- and community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus infections have become major health concerns in terms of morbidity, suffering and cost. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is an alternative treatment for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections. However, TMP-resistant strains have arisen with point mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the target for TMP. A single point mutation, F98Y, has been shown biochemically to confer the majority of this resistance to TMP. Using a structure-based approach, we have designed a series of novel propargyl-linked DHFR inhibitors that are active against several trimethoprim-resistant enzymes. We screened this series against wild-type and mutant (F98Y) S. aureus DHFR and found that several are active against both enzymes and specifically that the meta-biphenyl class of these inhibitors is the most potent. In order to understand the structural basis of this potency, we determined eight high-resolution crystal structures: four each of the wild-type and mutant DHFR enzymes bound to various propargyl-linked DHFR inhibitors. In addition to explaining the structure-activity relationships, several of the structures reveal a novel conformation for the cofactor, NADPH. In this new conformation that is predominantly associated with the mutant enzyme, the nicotinamide ring is displaced from its conserved location and three water molecules complete a network of hydrogen bonds between the nicotinamide ring and the protein. In this new position, NADPH has reduced interactions with the inhibitor. An equilibrium between the two conformations of NADPH, implied by their occupancies in the eight crystal structures, is influenced both by the ligand and the F98Y mutation. The mutation induced equilibrium between two NADPH-binding conformations may contribute to decrease TMP binding and thus may be responsible for TMP resistance.</p>

<p>Crystallization conditions for an HIV-1 protease-inhibitor complex were optimized to produce crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments. The X-ray structure of the HIV-1 protease complex was solved and refined at 3.1 A resolution. In contrast to Saquinavir, the mimetic hydroxy group of the inhibitor Boc-Phe-Psi[(S)-CH(OH)CH(2)NH]-Phe-Glu-Phe-NH(2) is placed asymmetrically with respect to the non-crystallographic twofold axis of the protease dimer so that hydrogen bonds between the amino group of the inhibitor and the catalytic aspartates can be formed. The inhibitor binds in the centre of the active site by a compact network of hydrogen bonds to Gly27, Gly127, Asp25, Asp125 and via the buried water molecule W301 to Ile50 and Ile150.</p>

<p>Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) represents an important target for the treatment of hyperproliferative and inflammatory diseases. In the cell DHODH catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. DHODH inhibition results in beneficial immunosuppressant and antiproliferative effects in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we present high-resolution X-ray structures of human DHODH in complex with a novel class of low molecular weight compounds that inhibit the enzyme in the nanomolar range. Some compounds showed an interesting dual binding mode within the same cocrystal strongly depending on the nature of chemical substitution. Measured in vitro activity data correlated with the prevailing mode of binding and explained the observed structure-activity relationship. Additionally, the X-ray data confirmed the competitive nature of the inhibitors toward the putative ubiquinone binding site and will guide structure-based design and synthesis of molecules with higher activity.</p>

<p>The essential enzyme 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECP) synthase, found in most eubacteria and the apicomplexan parasites, participates in isoprenoid-precursor biosynthesis and is a validated target for the development of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs. The structure and mechanism of the enzyme have been elucidated and the recent exciting finding that the enzyme actually binds diphosphate-containing isoprenoids at the interface formed by the three subunits that constitute the active protein suggests the possibility of feedback regulation of MECP synthase. To investigate such a possibility, a form of the enzyme was sought that did not bind these ligands but which would retain the quaternary structure necessary to create the active site. Two amino acids, Arg142 and Glu144, in Escherichia coli MECP synthase were identified as contributing to ligand binding. Glu144 interacts directly with Arg142 and positions the basic residue to form two hydrogen bonds with the terminal phosphate group of the isoprenoid diphosphate ligand. This association occurs at the trimer interface and three of these arginines interact with the ligand phosphate group. A dual mutation was designed (Arg142 to methionine and Glu144 to leucine) to disrupt the electrostatic attractions between the enzyme and the phosphate group to investigate whether an enzyme without isoprenoid diphosphate could be obtained. A low-resolution crystal structure of the mutated MECP synthase Met142/Leu144 revealed that geranyl diphosphate was retained despite the removal of six hydrogen bonds normally formed with the enzyme. This indicates that these two hydrophilic residues on the surface of the enzyme are not major determinants of isoprenoid binding at the trimer interface but rather that hydrophobic interactions between the hydrocarbon tail and the core of the enzyme trimer dominate ligand binding.</p>

<p>Uridine-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is a precursor of the bacterial and fungal cell wall. It is also used in a component of N-linked glycosylation and the glycosylphosphoinositol anchor of eukaryotic proteins. It is synthesized from N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) and uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP) by UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (UAP). This is an S(N)2 reaction; the non-esterified oxygen atom of the GlcNAc-1-P phosphate group attacks the alpha-phosphate group of UTP. We determined crystal structures of UAP from Candida albicans (CaUAP1) without any ligands and also complexed with its substrate or with its product. The series of structures in different forms shows the induced fit movements of CaUAP1. Three loops approaching the ligand molecule close the active site when ligand is bound. In addition, Lys-421, instead of the metal ion in prokaryotic UAPs, is coordinated by both phosphate groups of UDP-Glc-NAc and acts as a cofactor. However, a magnesium ion enhances the enzymatic activity of CaUAP1, and thus we propose that the magnesium ion increases the affinity between UTP and the enzyme by coordinating to the alpha- and gamma-phosphate group of UTP.</p>

<p>N-Acyl-beta-sultams are time-dependent, irreversible active site-directed inhibitors of Streptomyces R61 DD-peptidase. The rate of inactivation is first order with respect to beta-sultam concentration, and the second-order rate constants show a dependence on pH similar to that for the hydrolysis of a substrate. Inactivation is due to the formation of a stable 1:1 enzyme-inhibitor complex as a result of the active site serine being sulfonylated by the beta-sultam as shown by ESI-MS analysis and by X-ray crystallography. A striking feature of the sulfonyl enzyme is that the inhibitor is not bound to the oxyanion hole but interacts extensively with the "roof" of the active site where the Arg 285 is located.</p>

<p>In the present paper, design, synthesis, X-ray crystallographic analysis, and HIV-1 protease inhibitory activities of a novel class of compounds are disclosed. Compounds 28-30, 32, 35, and 40 were synthesized and found to be inhibitors of the HIV-1 protease. The crucial step in their synthesis involved an unusual endo radical cyclization process. Absolute stereochemistry of the three asymmetric centers in the above compounds have been established to be (4S,2'R,3'S) for optimal potency.

<p>Pharmacophores are chemical scaffolds upon which changes in chemical moieties (R-groups) at specific sites are made to identify a combination of R-groups that increases the therapeutic potency of a small molecule inhibitor while minimizing adverse effects. We developed a pharmacophore based on a carbonyloxime (OXIM) scaffold for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a protein involved in the pathology of sepsis, to validate that inhibition of a catalytic site could produce therapeutic benefits. We studied the crystal structures of MIF.OXIM-based inhibitors and found two opposite orientations for binding to the active site that were dependent on the chemical structures of an R-group. One orientation was completely unexpected based on previous studies with hydroxyphenylpyruvate and (S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1). We further confirmed that the unexpected binding mode targets MIF in cellular studies by showing that one compound, OXIM-11, abolished the counter-regulatory activity of MIF on anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid action. OXIM-11 treatment of mice, initiated 24 h after the onset of cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis, significantly improved survival when compared with vehicle-treated controls, confirming that inhibition of the MIF catalytic site could produce therapeutic effects. The crystal structures of the MIF inhibitor complexes provide insight for further structure-based drug design efforts.</p>

<p>The OP (organophosphate)-degrading enzyme from Agrobacterium radiobacter (OpdA) is a binuclear metallohydrolase able to degrade highly toxic OP pesticides and nerve agents into less or non-toxic compounds. In the present study, the effect of metal ion substitutions and site-directed mutations on the catalytic properties of OpdA are investigated. The study shows the importance of both the metal ion composition and a hydrogen-bond network that connects the metal ion centre with the substrate-binding pocket using residues Arg254 and Tyr257 in the mechanism and substrate specificity of this enzyme. For the Co(II) derivative of OpdA two protonation equilibria (pKa1 ~5; pKa2 ~10) have been identified as relevant for catalysis, and a terminal hydroxide acts as the likely hydrolysis-initiating nucleophile. In contrast, the Zn(II) and Cd(II) derivatives only have one relevant protonation equilibrium (pKa ~4-5), and the μOH is the proposed nucleophile. The observed mechanistic flexibility may reconcile contrasting reaction models that have been published previously and may be beneficial for the rapid adaptation of OP-degrading enzymes to changing environmental pressures.</p>

<p>The most active anticancer component in green tea is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). The human peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (Pin1) plays a critical role in oncogenic signaling. Herein, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Pin1/EGCG complex resolved at 1.9 Å resolution. Notably, the structure revealed the presence of EGCG in both the WW and PPIase domains of Pin1. The direct binding of EGCG with Pin1 was confirmed and the interaction inhibited Pin1 PPIase activity. In addition, proliferation of cells expressing Pin1 was inhibited and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model was suppressed. The binding of EGCG with Arg17 in the WW domain prevented the binding of c-Jun, a well-known Pin1 substrate. EGCG treatment corresponded with a decreased abundance of cyclin D1 and diminution of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-l3-acetate-induced AP-1 or NF-κB promoter activity in cells expressing Pin1. Overall, these results showed that EGCG directly suppresses the tumor-promoting effect of Pin1.</p>

<p>Malaria parasite strains have emerged to tolerate the therapeutic effects of the prophylactics and drugs presently available. This resistance now poses a serious challenge to researchers in the bid to overcome malaria parasitic infection. Recent studies have shown that FK520 and its analogs inhibit malaria parasites growth by binding to FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) of the parasites. Structure based drug screening efforts based on three-dimensional structural information of FKBPs from Plasmodium falciparum led us to identify new chemical entities that bind to the parasite FKBP35 and inhibit its growth. Our experimental results verify that this novel compound (D44) modulate the PPIase activity of Plasmodium FKBP35 and demonstrate the stage-specific growth inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum strains. Here, we present the X-ray crystallographic structures of FK506 binding domains (FKBDs) of PfFKBP35 and PvFKBP35 in complex with the newly identified inhibitor providing molecular insights into its mode of action. </p>

<p>N(10) -formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) is a folate enzyme that catalyzes the formylation of tetrahydrofolate (THF) in an ATP dependent manner. Structures of FTHFS from the thermophilic homoacetogen, Moorella thermoacetica, complexed with (1) a catalytic intermediate-formylphosphate (XPO) and product-ADP; (2) with an inhibitory substrate analog-folate; (3) with XPO and an inhibitory THF analog, ZD9331, were used to analyze the enzyme mechanism. Nucleophilic attack of the formate ion on the gamma phosphate of ATP leads to the formation of XPO and the first product ADP. A channel that leads to the putative formate binding pocket allows for the binding of ATP and formate in random order. Formate binding is due to interactions with the gamma-phosphate moiety of ATP and additionally to two hydrogen bonds from the backbone nitrogen of Ala276 and the side chain of Arg97. Upon ADP dissociation, XPO reorients and moves to the position previously occupied by the beta-phosphate of ATP. Conformational changes that occur due to the XPO presence apparently allow for the recruitment of the third substrate, THF, with its pterin moiety positioned between Phe384 and Trp412. This position overlaps with that of the bound nucleoside, which is consistent with a catalytic mechanism hypothesis that FTHFS works via a sequential ping-pong mechanism. More specifically, a random bi uni uni bi ping-pong ter ter mechanism is proposed. Additionally, the native structure originally reported at a 2.5 Å resolution was redetermined at a 2.2 Å resolution.</p>

<p>Holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS, human) and BirA (Escherichia coli) are biotin protein ligases that catalyze the ATP-dependent attachment of biotin to apocarboxylases. Biotin attachment occurs on a highly conserved lysine residue within a consensus sequence (Ala/Val-Met-Lys-Met) that is found in carboxylases in most organisms. Numerous studies have indicated that HCS and BirA, as well as biotin protein ligases from other organisms, can attach biotin to apocarboxylases from different organisms, indicating that the mechanism of biotin attachment is well conserved. In this study, we examined the cross-reactivity of biotin attachment between human and bacterial biotin ligases by comparing biotinylation of p-67 and BCCP87, the biotin-attachment domain fragments from human propionyl-CoA carboxylase and E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase, respectively. While BirA has similar biotinylation activity toward the two substrates, HCS has reduced activity toward bacterial BCCP87 relative to its native substrate, p-67. The crystal structure of a digested form of p-67, spanning a sequence that contains a seven-residue protruding thumb loop in BCCP87, revealed the absence of a similar structure in the human peptide. Significantly, an engineered "thumbless" bacterial BCCP87 could be biotinylated by HCS, with substrate affinity restored to near normal. This study suggests that the thumb loop found in bacterial carboxylases interferes with optimal interaction with the mammalian biotin protein ligase. While the function of the thumb loop remains unknown, these results indicate a constraint on specificity of the bacterial substrate for biotin attachment that is not itself a feature of BirA.</p>

<p>DNA replication in all organisms requires polymerases to synthesize copies of the genome. DNA polymerases are unable to function on a bare template and require a primer. Primases are crucial RNA polymerases that perform the initial de novo synthesis, generating the first 8-10 nucleotides of the primer. Although structures of archaeal and bacterial primases have provided insights into general priming mechanisms, these proteins are not well conserved with heterodimeric (p48/p58) primases in eukaryotes. Here, we present X-ray crystal structures of the catalytic engine of a eukaryotic primase, which is contained in the p48 subunit. The structures of p48 reveal that eukaryotic primases maintain the conserved catalytic prim fold domain, but with a unique subdomain not found in the archaeal and bacterial primases. Calorimetry experiments reveal that Mn(2+) but not Mg(2+) significantly enhances the binding of nucleotide to primase, which correlates with higher catalytic efficiency in vitro. The structure of p48 with bound UTP and Mn(2+) provides insights into the mechanism of nucleotide synthesis by primase. Substitution of conserved residues involved in either metal or nucleotide binding alter nucleotide binding affinities, and yeast strains containing the corresponding Pri1p substitutions are not viable. Our results reveal that two residues (S160 and H166) in direct contact with the nucleotide were previously unrecognized as critical to the human primase active site. Comparing p48 structures to those of similar polymerases in different states of action suggests changes that would be required to attain a catalytically competent conformation capable of initiating dinucleotide synthesis. </p>

<p>Prediction of interaction energies between ligands and their receptors remains a major challenge for structure-based inhibitor discovery. Much effort has been devoted to developing scoring schemes that can successfully rank the affinities of a diverse set of possible ligands to a binding site for which the structure is known. To test these scoring functions, well-characterized experimental systems can be very useful. Here, mutation-created binding sites in T4 lysozyme were used to investigate how the quality of atomic charges and solvation energies affects molecular docking. Atomic charges and solvation energies were calculated for 172,118 molecules in the Available Chemicals Directory using a semi-empirical quantum mechanical approach by the program AMSOL. The database was first screened against the apolar cavity site created by the mutation Leu99Ala (L99A). Compared to the electronegativity-based charges that are widely used, the new charges and desolvation energies improved ranking of known apolar ligands, and better distinguished them from more polar isosteres that are not observed to bind. To investigate whether the new charges had predictive value, the non-polar residue Met102, which forms part of the binding site, was changed to the polar residue glutamine. The structure of the resulting Leu99Ala and Met102Gln double mutant of T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q) was determined and the docking calculation was repeated for the new site. Seven representative polar molecules that preferentially docked to the polar versus the apolar binding site were tested experimentally. All seven bind to the polar cavity (L99A/M102Q) but do not detectably bind to the apolar cavity (L99A). Five ligand-bound structures of L99A/M102Q were determined by X-ray crystallography. Docking predictions corresponded to the crystallographic results to within 0.4A RMSD. Improved treatment of partial atomic charges and desolvation energies in database docking appears feasible and leads to better distinction of true ligands. Simple model binding sites, such as L99A and its more polar variants, may find broad use in the development and testing of docking algorithms.</p>

<p>We report the structures of three intermediates in the O2 activation and insertion reactions of an extradiol ring-cleaving dioxygenase. A crystal of Fe2+-containing homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase was soaked in the slow substrate 4-nitrocatechol in a low O2 atmosphere. The x-ray crystal structure shows that three different intermediates reside in different subunits of a single homotetrameric enzyme molecule. One of these is the key substrate-alkylperoxo-Fe2+ intermediate, which has been predicted, but not structurally characterized, in an oxygenase. The intermediates define the major chemical steps of the dioxygenase mechanism and point to a general mechanistic strategy for the diverse 2-His-1-carboxylate enzyme family.</p>

<p>Malaria, a disease of worldwide significance, is responsible for over one million deaths annually. The liver-stage of Plasmodium's life cycle is the first, obligatory, but clinically silent step in malaria infection. The P. falciparum type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (PfFAS-II) has been found to be essential for complete liver-stage development and has been regarded as a potential antimalarial target for the development of drugs for malaria prophylaxis and liver-stage eradication. In this paper, new coumarin-based triclosan analogues are reported and their biological profile is explored in terms of inhibitory potency against enzymes of the PfFAS-II pathway. Among the tested compounds, 7 and 8 showed the highest inhibitory potency against Pf enoyl-ACP-reductase (PfFabI), followed by 15 and 3. Finally, we determined the crystal structures of compounds 7 and 11 in complex with PfFabI to identify their mode of binding and to confirm outcomes of docking simulations. </p>

<p>Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) are mostly monomeric enzymes which fold into a highly conserved (α/β)8 barrel, while their substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity are determined by interaction with residues located in three highly variable external loops. The closely related human enzymes aldose reductase (AR or AKR1B1) and AKR1B10 are of biomedical interest because of their involvement in secondary diabetic complications (AR) and in cancer, e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma and smoking-related lung cancer (AKR1B10). After characterization of the IC50 values of both AKRs with a series of polyhalogenated compounds, 2,2',3,3',5,5',6,6'-octafluoro-4,4'-biphenyldiol (JF0064) was identified as a lead inhibitor of both enzymes with a new scaffold (a 1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diol). An ultrahigh-resolution X-ray structure of the AR-NADP(+)-JF0064 complex has been determined at 0.85 Å resolution, allowing it to be observed that JF0064 interacts with the catalytic residue Tyr48 through a negatively charged hydroxyl group (i.e. the acidic phenol). The non-competitive inhibition pattern observed for JF0064 with both enzymes suggests that this acidic hydroxyl group is also present in the case of AKR1B10. Moreover, the combination of surface lysine methylation and the introduction of K125R and V301L mutations enabled the determination of the X-ray crystallographic structure of the corresponding AKR1B10-NADP(+)-JF0064 complex. Comparison of the two structures has unveiled some important hints for subsequent structure-based drug-design efforts. </p>

<p>The human sensor of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (hOAS1) polymerizes ATP into 2',5'-linked iso-RNA (2-5A) involved in innate immunity, cell cycle, and differentiation. We report the crystal structure of hOAS1 in complex with dsRNA and 2'-deoxy ATP at 2.7 Å resolution, which reveals the mechanism of cytoplasmic dsRNA recognition and activation of oligoadenylate synthetases. Human OAS1 recognizes dsRNA using a previously uncharacterized protein/RNA interface that forms via a conformational change induced by binding of dsRNA. The protein/RNA interface involves two minor grooves and has no sequence-specific contacts, with the exception of a single hydrogen bond between the -NH(2) group of nucleobase G17 and the carbonyl oxygen of serine 56. Using a biochemical readout, we show that hOAS1 undergoes more than 20,000-fold activation upon dsRNA binding and that canonical or GU-wobble substitutions produce dsRNA mutants that retain either full or partial activity, in agreement with the crystal structure. Ultimately, the binding of dsRNA promotes an elaborate conformational rearrangement in the N-terminal lobe of hOAS1, which brings residues D75, D77, and D148 into proximity and creates coordination geometry for binding of two catalytic Mg(2+) ions and ATP. The assembly of this critical active-site structure provides the gate that couples binding of dsRNA to the production and downstream functions of 2-5A.</p>

<p>The structures of Leishmania mexicana cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (Lm iPGAM) crystallised with the substrate 3-phosphoglycerate at high and low cobalt concentrations have been solved at 2.00- and 1.90-A resolutions. Both structures are very similar and the active site contains both 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate at equal occupancies (50%). Lm iPGAM co-crystallised with the product 2-phosphoglycerate yields the same structure. Two Co(2+) are coordinated within the active site with different geometries and affinities. The cobalt at the M1 site has a distorted octahedral geometry and is present at 100% occupancy. The M2-site Co(2+) binds with distorted tetrahedral geometry, with only partial occupancy, and coordinates with Ser75, the residue involved in phosphotransfer. When the M2 site is occupied, the side chain of Ser75 adopts a position that is unfavourable for catalysis, indicating that this site may not be occupied under physiological conditions and that catalysis may occur via a one-metal mechanism. The geometry of the M2 site suggests that it is possible for Ser75 to be activated for phosphotransfer by H-bonding to nearby residues rather than by metal coordination. The 16 active-site residues of Lm iPGAM are conserved in the Mn-dependent iPGAM from Bacillus stearothermophilus (33% overall sequence identity). However, Lm iPGAM has an inserted tyrosine (Tyr210) that causes the M2 site to diminish in size, consistent with its reduced metal affinity. Tyr210 is present in trypanosomatid and plant iPGAMs, but not in the enzymes from other organisms, indicating that there are two subclasses of iPGAMs.</p>

<p>The structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis dUTP nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) has been determined at 1.3 Angstrom resolution in complex with magnesium ion and the non-hydrolyzable substrate analog, alpha,beta-imido dUTP. dUTPase is an enzyme essential for depleting potentially toxic concentrations of dUTP in the cell. Given the importance of its biological role, it has been proposed that inhibiting M.tuberculosis dUTPase might be an effective means to treat tuberculosis infection in humans. The crystal structure presented here offers some insight into the potential for designing a specific inhibitor of the M.tuberculosis dUTPase enzyme. The structure also offers new insights into the mechanism of dUTP hydrolysis by providing an accurate representation of the enzyme-substrate complex in which both the metal ion and dUTP analog are included. The structure suggests that inclusion of a magnesium ion is important for stabilizing the position of the alpha-phosphorus for an in-line nucleophilic attack. In the absence of magnesium, the alpha-phosphate of dUTP can have either of the two positions which differ by 4.5 Angstrom. A transiently ordered C-terminal loop further assists catalysis by shielding the general base, Asp83, from solvent thus elevating its pK(a) so that it might in turn activate a tightly bound water molecule for nucleophilic attack. The metal ion coordinates alpha, beta, and gamma phosphate groups with tridentate geometry identical with that observed in the crystal structure of DNA polymerase beta complexed with magnesium and dNTP analog, revealing some common features in catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>A component of the shikimate biosynthetic pathway, dehydroquinate dehydratase (DHQD) catalyzes the dehydration of 3-dehydroquniate (DHQ) to 3-dehydroshikimate. In the type I DHQD reaction mechanism a lysine forms a Schiff base intermediate with DHQ. The Schiff base acts as an electron sink to facilitate the catalytic dehydration. To address the mechanism of Schiff base formation, we determined structures of the Salmonella enterica wild-type DHQD in complex with the substrate analogue quinate and the product analogue shikimate. In addition, we determined the structure of the K170M mutant (Lys170 being the Schiff base forming residue) in complex with quinate. Combined with nuclear magnetic resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry data that revealed altered binding of the analogue to the K170M mutant, these structures suggest a model of Schiff base formation characterized by the dynamic interplay of opposing forces acting on either side of the substrate. On the side distant from the substrate 3-carbonyl group, closure of the enzyme's β8-α8 loop is proposed to guide DHQ into the proximity of the Schiff base-forming Lys170. On the 3-carbonyl side of the substrate, Lys170 sterically alters the position of DHQ's reactive ketone, aligning it at an angle conducive for nucleophilic attack. This study of a type I DHQD reveals the interplay between the enzyme and substrate required for the correct orientation of a functional group constrained within a cyclic substrate. </p>

<p>Escherichia coli glycogen synthase (EcGS, EC 2.4.1.21) is a retaining glycosyltransferase (GT) that transfers glucose from adenosine diphosphate glucose to a glucan chain acceptor with retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon. EcGS belongs to the GT-B structural superfamily. Here we report several EcGS x-ray structures that together shed considerable light on the structure and function of these enzymes. The structure of the wild-type enzyme bound to ADP and glucose revealed a 15.2 degrees overall domain-domain closure and provided for the first time the structure of the catalytically active, closed conformation of a glycogen synthase. The main chain carbonyl group of His-161, Arg-300, and Lys-305 are suggested by the structure to act as critical catalytic residues in the transglycosylation. Glu-377, previously thought to be catalytic is found on the alpha-face of the glucose and plays an electrostatic role in the active site and as a glucose ring locator. This is also consistent with the structure of the EcGS(E377A)-ADP-HEPPSO complex where the glucose moiety is either absent or disordered in the active site.</p>

<p>Dehydroquinate dehydratase (DHQD) catalyzes the third reaction in the biosynthetic shikimate pathway. Type I DHQDs are members of the greater aldolase superfamily, a group of enzymes that contain an active site lysine that forms a Schiff base intermediate. Three residues (Glu86, His143, and Lys170 in the Salmonella enterica DHQD) have previously been proposed to form a triad vital for catalysis. While the roles of Lys170 and His143 are well defined-Lys170 forms the Schiff base with the substrate and His143 shuttles protons in multiple steps in the reaction-the role of Glu86 remains poorly characterized. To probe Glu86's role, Glu86 mutants were generated and subjected to biochemical and structural study. The studies presented here demonstrate that mutant enzymes retain catalytic proficiency, calling into question the previously attributed role of Glu86 in catalysis and suggesting that His143 and Lys170 function as a catalytic dyad. Structures of the Glu86Ala (E86A) mutant in complex with covalently bound reaction intermediate reveal a conformational change of the His143 side chain. This indicates a predominant steric role for Glu86, to maintain the His143 side chain in position consistent with catalysis. The structures also explain why the E86A mutant is optimally active at more acidic conditions than the wild-type enzyme. In addition, a complex with the reaction product reveals a novel, likely nonproductive, binding mode that suggests a mechanism of competitive product inhibition and a potential strategy for the design of therapeutics.</p>

<p>Both large-to-small and nonpolar-to-polar mutations in the hydrophobic core of T4 lysozyme cause significant loss in stability. By including supplementary stabilizing mutations we constructed a variant that combines the cavity-creating substitution Leu99 --&gt; Ala with the buried charge mutant Met102 --&gt; Glu. Crystal structure determination confirmed that this variant has a large cavity with the side chain of Glu102 located within the cavity wall. The cavity includes a large disk-shaped region plus a bulge. The disk-like region is essentially nonpolar, similar to L99A, while the Glu102 substituent is located in the vicinity of the bulge. Three ordered water molecules bind within this part of the cavity and appear to stabilize the conformation of Glu102. Glu102 has an estimated pKa of about 5.5-6.5, suggesting that it is at least partially charged in the crystal structure. The polar ligands pyridine, phenol and aniline bind within the cavity, and crystal structures of the complexes show one or two water molecules to be retained. Nonpolar ligands of appropriate shape can also bind in the cavity and in some cases exclude all three water molecules. This disrupts the hydrogen-bond network and causes the Glu102 side chain to move away from the ligand by up to 0.8 A where it remains buried in a completely nonpolar environment. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the binding of these compounds stabilizes the protein by 4-6 kcal/mol. For both polar and nonpolar ligands the binding is enthalpically driven. Large negative changes in entropy adversely balance the binding of the polar ligands, whereas entropy has little effect on the nonpolar ligand binding.</p>

<p>Aspartoacylase catalyzes hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-aspartate to aspartate and acetate in the vertebrate brain. Deficiency in this activity leads to spongiform degeneration of the white matter of the brain and is the established cause of Canavan disease, a fatal progressive leukodystrophy affecting young children. We present crystal structures of recombinant human and rat aspartoacylase refined to 2.8- and 1.8-A resolution, respectively. The structures revealed that the N-terminal domain of aspartoacylase adopts a protein fold similar to that of zinc-dependent hydrolases related to carboxypeptidases A. The catalytic site of aspartoacylase shows close structural similarity to those of carboxypeptidases despite only 10-13% sequence identity between these proteins. About 100 C-terminal residues of aspartoacylase form a globular domain with a two-stranded beta-sheet linker that wraps around the N-terminal domain. The long channel leading to the active site is formed by the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domain is positioned in a way that prevents productive binding of polypeptides in the active site. The structures revealed that residues 158-164 may undergo a conformational change that results in opening and partial closing of the channel entrance. We hypothesize that the catalytic mechanism of aspartoacylase is closely analogous to that of carboxypeptidases. We identify residues involved in zinc coordination, and propose which residues may be involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The structures also provide a structural framework necessary for understanding the deleterious effects of many missense mutations of human aspartoacylase.</p>

<p>Glyoxylate reductase catalyzes the NAD(P)H-linked reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate. Here, the 1.7 A crystal structure of glyoxylate reductase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 complexed with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADP(H)] determined by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method is reported. The monomeric structure comprises the two domains typical of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases: the substrate-binding domain (SBD) and the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The crystal structure and analytical ultracentrifugation results revealed dimer formation. In the NADP(H)-binding site, the pyrophosphate moiety and the 2'-phosphoadenosine moiety are recognized by the glycine-rich loop (residues 157-162) and by loop residues 180-182, respectively. Furthermore, the present study revealed that P. horikoshii glyoxylate reductase contains aromatic clusters and has a larger number of ion pairs and a lower percentage of hydrophobic accessible surface area than its mesophilic homologues, suggesting its thermostability mechanism.</p>

<p>The enzymatic transfer of the sugar mannose from activated sugar donors is central to the synthesis of a wide range of biologically significant polysaccharides and glycoconjugates. In addition to their importance in cellular biology, mannosyltransferases also provide model systems with which to study catalytic mechanisms of glycosyl transfer. Mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) catalyzes the synthesis of α-mannosyl-D-glycerate using GDP-mannose as the preferred donor species, a reaction that occurs with a net retention of anomeric configuration. Past work has shown that the Rhodothermus marinus MGS, classified as a GT78 glycosyltransferase, displays a GT-A fold and performs catalysis in a metal ion-dependent manner. MGS shows very unusual metal ion dependences with Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) and, to a lesser extent, Mn(2+), Ni(2+), and Co(2+), thus facilitating catalysis. Here, we probe these dependences through kinetic and calorimetric analyses of wild-type and site-directed variants of the enzyme. Mutation of residues that interact with the guanine base of GDP are correlated with a higher k(cat) value, whereas substitution of His-217, a key component of the metal coordination site, results in a change in metal specificity to Mn(2+). Structural analyses of MGS complexes not only provide insight into metal coordination but also how lactate can function as an alternative acceptor to glycerate. These studies highlight the role of flexible loops in the active center and the subsequent coordination of the divalent metal ion as key factors in MGS catalysis and metal ion dependence. Furthermore, Tyr-220, located on a flexible loop whose conformation is likely influenced by metal binding, also plays a critical role in substrate binding.</p>

<p>γ-Butyrobetaine hydroxylase (BBOX) catalyzes the conversion of gamma butyrobetaine (GBB) to l-carnitine, which is involved in the generation of metabolic energy from long-chain fatty acids. BBOX inhibitor 3-(1,1,1-trimethylhydrazin-1-ium-2-yl)propanoate (mildronate), which is an approved, clinically used cardioprotective drug, is a relatively poor BBOX inhibitor and requires high daily doses. In this paper we describe the design, synthesis, and properties of 51 compounds, which include both GBB and mildronate analogues. We have discovered novel BBOX inhibitors with improved IC50 values; the best examples are in the nanomolar range and about 2 orders of magnitude better when compared to mildronate. For six inhibitors, crystal structures in complex with BBOX have been solved to explain their activities and pave the way for further inhibitor design. </p>

<p>Trehalose (alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-1,1-alpha-D-glucopyranose) is a non-reducing diglucoside found in various organisms that serves as a carbohydrate reserve and as an agent that protects against a variety of physical and chemical stresses. Deinococcus radiodurans possesses an alternative biosynthesis pathway for the synthesis of trehalose from maltooligosaccharides. This reaction is mediated by two enzymes: maltooligosyltrehalose synthase (MTSase) and maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (MTHase). Here, we present the 1.1A resolution crystal structure of MTHase. It consists of three major domains: two beta-sheet domains and a conserved glycosidase (beta/alpha)8 barrel catalytic domain. Three subdomains consisting of short insertions were identified within the catalytic domain. Subsequently, structures of MTHase in complex with maltose and trehalose were obtained at 1.2 A and 1.5 A resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the importance of the three inserted subdomains in providing the key residues required for substrate recognition. Trehalose is recognised specifically in the +1 and +2 binding subsites by an extensive hydrogen-bonding network and a strong hydrophobic stacking interaction in between two aromatic residues. Moreover, upon binding to maltose, which mimics the substrate sugar chain, a major concerted conformational change traps the sugar chain in the active site. The presence of magnesium in the active site of the MTHase-maltose complex suggests that MTHase activity may be regulated by divalent cations.</p>

<p>The crystal structures of two isoforms of nucleoside diphosphate kinase from bovine retina overexpressed in Escherischia coli have been determined to 2.4 A resolution. Both the isoforms, NBR-A and NBR-B, are hexameric and the fold of the monomer is in agreement with NDP-kinase structures from other biological sources. Although the polypeptide chains of the two isoforms differ by only two residues, they crystallize in different space groups. NBR-A crystallizes in space group P212121 with an entire hexamer in the asymmetric unit, while NBR-B crystallizes in space group P43212 with a trimer in the asymmetric unit. The highly conserved nucleotide-binding site observed in other nucleoside diphosphate kinase structures is also observed here. Both NBR-A and NBR-B were crystallized in the presence of cGMP. The nucleotide is bound with the base in the anti conformation. The NBR-A active site contained both cGMP and GDP each bound at half occupancy. Presumably, NBR-A had retained GDP (or GTP) from the purification process. The NBR-B active site contained only cGMP.</p>

<p>Human carbonyl reductase 1 (hCBR1) is an NADPH-dependent short chain dehydrogenase/reductase with broad substrate specificity and is thought to be responsible for the in vivo reduction of quinones, prostaglandins, and other carbonyl-containing compounds including xenobiotics. In addition, hCBR1 possesses a glutathione binding site that allows for increased affinity toward GSH-conjugated molecules. It has been suggested that the GSH-binding site is near the active site; however, no structures with GSH or GSH conjugates have been reported. We have solved the x-ray crystal structures of hCBR1 and a substrate mimic in complex with GSH and the catalytically inert GSH conjugate hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH). The structures reveal the GSH-binding site and provide insight into the affinity determinants for GSH-conjugated substrates. We further demonstrate that the structural isostere of HMGSH, S-nitrosoglutathione, is an ideal hCBR1 substrate (Km = 30 microm, kcat = 450 min(-1)) with kinetic constants comparable with the best known hCBR1 substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hCBR1 dependent GSNO reduction occurs in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lysates and suggest that hCBR1 may be involved in regulation of tissue levels of GSNO.</p>

<p>Oligopeptidase B (OPB) is a serine peptidase with dibasic substrate specificity. It is found in bacteria, plants, and trypanosomatid pathogens, where it has been identified as a virulence factor and potential drug target. In this study we expressed active recombinant Leishmania major OPB and provide the first structure of an oligopeptidase B at high resolution. The crystallographic study reveals that OPB comprises two domains, a catalytic and a propeller domain, linked together by a hinge region. The structure has been determined in complex with the oligopeptide, protease-inhibitor antipain, giving detailed information on the enzyme active site and extended substrate binding pockets. It shows that Glu-621 plays a critical role in the S1 binding pocket and, along with Phe-603, is largely responsible for the enzyme substrate specificity in P1. In the S2 binding pocket, Tyr-499 was shown to be important for substrate stability. The structure also allowed an investigation into the function of residues highlighted in other studies including Glu-623, which was predicted to be involved in the S1 binding pocket but is found forming an inter-domain hydrogen bond. Additional important salt bridges/hydrogen bonds between the two domains were observed, highlighting the significance of the domain interface in OPB. This work provides a foundation for the study of the role of OPBs as virulence factors in trypanosomatids. It could facilitate the development of specific OPB inhibitors with therapeutic potential by exploiting its unique substrate recognition properties as well as providing a model for OPBs in general.</p>

<p>Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a membrane-bound glutamate carboxypeptidase overexpressed in many forms of prostate cancer. Our laboratory has recently disclosed a class of small molecules, called ARM-Ps (antibody-recruiting molecule targeting prostate cancer) that are capable of enhancing antibody-mediated immune recognition of prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, during the course of these studies, we found ARM-Ps to exhibit extraordinarily high potencies toward PSMA, compared to previously reported inhibitors. Here, we report in-depth biochemical, crystallographic, and computational investigations which elucidate the origin of the observed affinity enhancement. These studies reveal a previously unreported arene-binding site on PSMA, which we believe participates in an aromatic stacking interaction with ARMs. Although this site is composed of only a few amino acid residues, it drastically enhances small molecule binding affinity. These results provide critical insights into the design of PSMA-targeted small molecules for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment; more broadly, the presence of similar arene-binding sites throughout the proteome could prove widely enabling in the optimization of small molecule-protein interactions.</p>

<p>Molecular docking is widely used to predict novel lead compounds for drug discovery. Success depends on the quality of the docking scoring function, among other factors. An imperfect scoring function can mislead by predicting incorrect ligand geometries or by selecting nonbinding molecules over true ligands. These false-positive hits may be considered "decoys". Although these decoys are frustrating, they potentially provide important tests for a docking algorithm; the more subtle the decoy, the more rigorous the test. Indeed, decoy databases have been used to improve protein structure prediction algorithms and protein-protein docking algorithms. Here, we describe 20 geometric decoys in five enzymes and 166 "hit list" decoys-i.e., molecules predicted to bind by our docking program that were tested and found not to do so-for beta-lactamase and two cavity sites in lysozyme. Especially in the cavity sites, which are very simple, these decoys highlight particular weaknesses in our scoring function. We also consider the performance of five other widely used docking scoring functions against our geometric and hit list decoys. Intriguingly, whereas many of these other scoring functions performed better on the geometric decoys, they typically performed worse on the hit list decoys, often highly ranking molecules that seemed to poorly complement the model sites. Several of these "hits"from the other scoring functions were tested experimentally and found, in fact, to be decoys. Collectively, these decoys provide a tool for the development and improvement of molecular docking scoring functions. Such improvements may, in turn, be rapidly tested experimentally against these and related experimental systems, which are well-behaved in assays and for structure determination.</p>

<p>Glutathione S -transferases (GSTs) play a pivotal role in the detoxification of foreign chemicals and toxic metabolites. They were originally termed ligandins because of their ability to bind large molecules (molecular masses &gt;400 Da), possibly for storage and transport roles. The location of the ligandin site in mammalian GSTs is still uncertain despite numerous studies in recent years. Here we show by X-ray crystallography that the ligandin binding site in human pi class GST P1-1 occupies part of one of the substrate binding sites. This work has been extended to the determination of a number of enzyme complex crystal structures which show that very large ligands are readily accommodated into this substrate binding site and in all, but one case, causes no significant movement of protein side-chains. Some of these molecules make use of a hitherto undescribed binding site located in a surface pocket of the enzyme. This site is conserved in most, but not all, classes of GSTs suggesting it may play an important functional role.</p>

<p>Initiation of DNA synthesis in genomic duplication depends on primase, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that synthesizes de novo the oligonucleotides that prime DNA replication. Due to the discontinuous nature of DNA replication, primase activity on the lagging strand is required throughout the replication process. In eukaryotic cells, the presence of primase at the replication fork is secured by its physical association with DNA polymerase α (Pol α), which extends the RNA primer with deoxynucleotides. Our knowledge of the mechanism that primes DNA synthesis is very limited, as structural information for the eukaryotic enzyme has proved difficult to obtain. Here, we describe the crystal structure of human primase in heterodimeric form consisting of full-length catalytic subunit and a C-terminally truncated large subunit. We exploit the crystallographic model to define the architecture of its nucleotide elongation site and to show that the small subunit integrates primer initiation and elongation within the same set of functional residues. Furthermore, we define in atomic detail the mode of association of primase to Pol α, the critical interaction that keeps primase tethered to the eukaryotic replisome. </p>

<p>Here, we report the 1.53-Å crystal structure of the enzyme 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine reductase (QueF) from Vibrio cholerae, which is responsible for the complete reduction of a nitrile (CN) bond to a primary amine (H(2)C-NH(2)). At present, this is the only example of a biological pathway that includes reduction of a nitrile bond, establishing QueF as particularly noteworthy. The structure of the QueF monomer resembles two connected ferrodoxin-like domains that assemble into dimers. Ligands identified in the crystal structure suggest the likely binding conformation of the native substrates NADPH and 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine. We also report on a series of numerical simulations that have shed light on the mechanism by which this enzyme affects the transfer of four protons (and electrons) to the 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine substrate. In particular, the simulations suggest that the initial step of the catalytic process is the formation of a covalent adduct with the residue Cys194, in agreement with previous studies. The crystal structure also suggests that two conserved residues (His233 and Asp102) play an important role in the delivery of a fourth proton to the substrate.</p>

<p>Double trouble: A hybrid organic-inorganic (organometallic) inhibitor was designed to target glutathione transferases. The metal center is used to direct protein binding, while the organic moiety acts as the active-site inhibitor (see picture). The mechanism of inhibition was studied using a range of biophysical and biochemical methods.</p>

<p>Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is an important target for antiviral inhibitors since its active site is highly conserved such that inhibitors can be cross-reactive against multiple types and subtypes of influenza. Here, we discuss the crystal structure of neuraminidase subtype N9 complexed with a new benzoic acid based inhibitor (2) that was designed to add contacts by overpacking one side of the active site pocket. Inhibitor 2 uses benzoic acid to mimic the pyranose ring, a bis-(hydroxymethyl)-substituted 2-pyrrolidinone ring in place of the N-acetyl group of the sialic acid, and a branched aliphatic structure to fill the sialic acid C6 subsite.</p>

<p>Human infection with Toxoplasma gondii is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Protozoan parasites such as T. gondii are incapable of de novo purine biosynthesis and must acquire purines from their host, so the purine salvage pathway offers a number of potential targets for antiparasitic chemotherapy. In T. gondii tachyzoites, adenosine is the predominantly salvaged purine nucleoside, and thus adenosine kinase is a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway of this parasite. The structure of T. gondii adenosine kinase was solved using molecular replacement and refined by simulated annealing at 1.8 A resolution to an R-factor of 0.214. The overall structure and the active site geometry are similar to human adenosine kinase, although there are significant differences. The T. gondii adenosine kinase has several unique features compared to the human sequence, including a five-residue deletion in one of the four linking segments between the two domains, which is probably responsible for a major change in the orientation of the two domains with respect to each other. These structural differences suggest the possibility of developing specific inhibitors of the parasitic enzyme.</p>

<p>The 2.5-A resolution crystal structure of recombinant aristolochene synthase from the blue cheese mold, Penicillium roqueforti, is the first of a fungal terpenoid cyclase. The structure of the enzyme reveals active site features that participate in the cyclization of the universal sesquiterpene cyclase substrate, farnesyl diphosphate, to form the bicyclic hydrocarbon aristolochene. Metal-triggered carbocation formation initiates the cyclization cascade, which proceeds through multiple complex intermediates to yield one exclusive structural and stereochemical isomer of aristolochene. Structural homology of this fungal cyclase with plant and bacterial terpenoid cyclases, despite minimal amino acid sequence identity, suggests divergence from a common, primordial ancestor in the evolution of terpene biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Chondroitin lyases (EC 4.2.2.4 and EC 4.2.2.5) are glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes that act as eliminases. Chondroitin lyase AC from Arthrobacter aurescens (ArthroAC) is known to act on chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate but not on dermatan sulfate. Like other chondroitin AC lyases, it is capable of cleaving hyaluronan. We have determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of ArthroAC in its native form as well as in complex with its substrates (chondroitin 4-sulfate tetrasaccharide, CS(tetra) and hyaluronan tetrasaccharide) at resolution varying from 1.25 A to 1.9A. The primary sequence of ArthroAC has not been previously determined but it was possible to determine the amino acid sequence of this enzyme from the high-resolution electron density maps and to confirm it by mass spectrometry. The enzyme-substrate complexes were obtained by soaking the substrate into the crystals for varying lengths of time (30 seconds to ten hours) and flash-cooling the crystals. The electron density map for crystals soaked in the substrate for as short as 30 seconds showed the substrate clearly and indicated that the ring of central glucuronic acid assumes a distorted boat conformation. This structure strongly supports the lytic mechanism where Tyr242 acts as a general base that abstracts the proton from the C5 position of glucuronic acid while Asn183 and His233 neutralize the charge on the glucuronate acidic group. Comparison of this structure with that of chondroitinase AC from Flavobacterium heparinum (FlavoAC) provides an explanation for the exolytic and endolytic mode of action of ArthroAC and FlavoAC, respectively.</p>

<p>We report here the results of a systematic high-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis of complexes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA polymerase with ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) and divalent metal ions. An unexpected observation revealed by this study is the existence of a specific rGTP binding site in a shallow pocket at the molecular surface of the enzyme, 30 A away from the catalytic site. This previously unidentified rGTP pocket, which lies at the interface between fingers and thumb, may be an allosteric regulatory site and could play a role in allowing alternative interactions between the two domains during a possible conformational change of the enzyme required for efficient initiation. The electron density map at 1.7-A resolution clearly shows the mode of binding of the guanosine moiety to the enzyme. In the catalytic site, density corresponding to the triphosphates of nucleotides bound to the catalytic metals was apparent in each complex with nucleotides. Moreover, a network of triphosphate densities was detected; these densities superpose to the corresponding moieties of the nucleotides observed in the initiation complex reported for the polymerase of bacteriophage phi6, strengthening the proposal that the two enzymes initiate replication de novo by similar mechanisms. No equivalent of the protein stacking platform observed for the priming nucleotide in the phi6 enzyme is present in HCV polymerase, however, again suggesting that a change in conformation of the thumb domain takes place upon template binding to allow for efficient de novo initiation of RNA synthesis.</p>

<p>A major base lesion resulting from oxidative stress is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG) that has ambiguous coding potential. Error-free DNA synthesis involves 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation to base pair with cytosine whereas mutagenic bypass involves 8-oxoG adopting a syn-conformation to base pair with adenine. Left unrepaired the syn-8-oxoG/dAMP base pair results in a G-C to T-A transversion. During base excision repair of this mispair, DNA polymerase (pol) β is confronted with gap filling opposite 8-oxoG. To determine how pol β discriminates between anti- and syn-8-oxoG, we introduced a point mutation (R283K) to alter insertion specificity. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this substitution results in an increased fidelity opposite 8-oxoG. Structural studies with R283K pol β show that the binary DNA complex has 8-oxoG in equilibrium between anti- and syn-forms. Ternary complexes with incoming dCTP resemble the wild-type enzyme, with templating anti-8-oxoG base pairing with incoming cytosine. In contrast to wild-type pol β, the ternary complex of the R283K mutant with an incoming dATP-analogue and templating 8-oxoG resembles a G-A mismatched structure with 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation. These results demonstrate that the incoming nucleotide is unable to induce a syn-8-oxoG conformation without minor groove DNA polymerase interactions that influence templating (anti-/syn-equilibrium) of 8-oxoG while modulating fidelity.</p>

<p>The mammalian extracellular ADP-ribosyl transferases ART1 through ART5 are sequence-related to each other. Among them ART2 is involved in immuno regulation. The variant ART2.2 was expressed in the periplasm of Escherichia coli and crystallized. Its structure was determined by X-ray diffraction at 1.7A resolution in one crystal form and at slightly lower resolutions in two others. The active center was indicated by a ligated nicotinamide analogue, which also revealed a small induced-fit. The centerpiece of the chainfold of ART2.2 agrees with those of all bacterial ADP-ribosyl transferases. This correspondence and the nicotinamide position were used to model the binding structure of the whole substrate NAD(+) at ART2.2. Two of the bacterial enzymes are structurally more closely related to ART2.2 while the others are more closely related to the eukaryotic poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase. This splits the ADP-ribosyl transferases into two distinct subfamilies. A special feature of ART2.2 is its long N-terminal extension and two disulfide bridges that are far away from the active center. They stabilize the protein against denaturation and presumably also against shearing forces parallel with the membrane where ART2.2 is anchored.</p>

<p>Trypanothione reductase is a key enzyme in the trypanothione-based redox metabolism of pathogenic trypanosomes. Because this system is absent in humans, being replaced with glutathione and glutathione reductase, it offers a target for selective inhibition. The rational design of potent inhibitors requires accurate structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes, but this is lacking for trypanothione reductase. We therefore used quinacrine mustard, an alkylating derivative of the competitive inhibitor quinacrine, to probe the active site of this dimeric flavoprotein. Quinacrine mustard irreversibly inactivates Trypanosoma cruzi trypanothione reductase, but not human glutathione reductase, in a time-dependent manner with a stoichiometry of two inhibitors bound per monomer. The rate of inactivation is dependent upon the oxidation state of trypanothione reductase, with the NADPH-reduced form being inactivated significantly faster than the oxidized form. Inactivation is slowed by clomipramine and a melarsen oxide-trypanothione adduct (both are competitive inhibitors) but accelerated by quinacrine. The structure of the trypanothione reductase-quinacrine mustard adduct was determined to 2.7 A, revealing two molecules of inhibitor bound in the trypanothione-binding site. The acridine moieties interact with each other through pi-stacking effects, and one acridine interacts in a similar fashion with a tryptophan residue. These interactions provide a molecular explanation for the differing effects of clomipramine and quinacrine on inactivation by quinacrine mustard. Synergism with quinacrine occurs as a result of these planar acridines being able to stack together in the active site cleft, thereby gaining an increased number of binding interactions, whereas antagonism occurs with nonplanar molecules, such as clomipramine, where stacking is not possible.</p>

<p>A major base lesion resulting from oxidative stress is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG) that has ambiguous coding potential. Error-free DNA synthesis involves 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation to base pair with cytosine whereas mutagenic bypass involves 8-oxoG adopting a syn-conformation to base pair with adenine. Left unrepaired the syn-8-oxoG/dAMP base pair results in a G-C to T-A transversion. During base excision repair of this mispair, DNA polymerase (pol) β is confronted with gap filling opposite 8-oxoG. To determine how pol β discriminates between anti- and syn-8-oxoG, we introduced a point mutation (R283K) to alter insertion specificity. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this substitution results in an increased fidelity opposite 8-oxoG. Structural studies with R283K pol β show that the binary DNA complex has 8-oxoG in equilibrium between anti- and syn-forms. Ternary complexes with incoming dCTP resemble the wild-type enzyme, with templating anti-8-oxoG base pairing with incoming cytosine. In contrast to wild-type pol β, the ternary complex of the R283K mutant with an incoming dATP-analogue and templating 8-oxoG resembles a G-A mismatched structure with 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation. These results demonstrate that the incoming nucleotide is unable to induce a syn-8-oxoG conformation without minor groove DNA polymerase interactions that influence templating (anti-/syn-equilibrium) of 8-oxoG while modulating fidelity.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of Atlantic cod lysozyme have been solved with and without ligand bound in the active site to 1.7 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. The structures reveal the presence of NAG in the substrate binding sites at both sides of the catalytic Glu73, hence allowing the first crystallographic description of the goose-type (g-type) lysozyme E-G binding sites. In addition, two aspartic acid residues suggested to participate in catalysis (Asp101 and Asp90) were mutated to alanine. Muramidase activity data for two single mutants and one double mutant demonstrates that both residues are involved in catalysis, but Asp101 is the more critical of the two. The structures and activity data suggest that a water molecule is the nucleophile completing the catalytic reaction, and the roles of the aspartic acids are to ensure proper positioning of the catalytic water.</p>

<p>Saquinavir (SQV), the first antiviral HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitor approved for AIDS therapy, has been studied in complexes with PR and the variants PR(I) (84V) and PR(V) (82A) containing the single mutations I84V and V82A that provide resistance to all the clinical inhibitors. Atomic resolution crystal structures (0.97-1.25 A) of the SQV complexes were analyzed in comparison to the protease complexes with darunavir, a new drug that targets resistant HIV, in order to understand the molecular basis of drug resistance. PR(I) (84V) and PR(V) (82A) complexes were obtained in both the space groups P2(1)2(1)2 and P2(1)2(1)2(1), which provided experimental limits for the conformational flexibility. The SQV interactions with PR were very similar in the mutant complexes, consistent with the similar inhibition constants. The mutation from bigger to smaller amino acids allows more space to accommodate the large group at P1' of SQV, unlike the reduced interactions observed in darunavir complexes. The residues 79-82 have adjusted to accommodate the large hydrophobic groups of SQV, suggesting that these residues are intrinsically flexible and their conformation depends more on the nature of the inhibitor than on the mutations in this region. This analysis will assist with development of more effective antiviral inhibitors.</p>

<p>Proline utilization A (PutA) proteins are bifunctional peripheral membrane flavoenzymes that catalyze the oxidation of L-proline to L-glutamate by the sequential activities of proline dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase domains. Located at the inner membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, PutAs play a major role in energy metabolism by coupling the oxidation of proline imported from the environment to the reduction of membrane-associated quinones. Here, we report seven crystal structures of the 1,004-residue PutA from Geobacter sulfurreducens, along with determination of the protein oligomeric state by small-angle X-ray scattering and kinetic characterization of substrate channeling and quinone reduction. The structures reveal an elaborate and dynamic tunnel system featuring a 75-Å-long tunnel that links the two active sites and six smaller tunnels that connect the main tunnel to the bulk medium. The locations of these tunnels and their responses to ligand binding and flavin reduction suggest hypotheses about how proline, water, and quinones enter the tunnel system and where L-glutamate exits. Kinetic measurements show that glutamate production from proline occurs without a lag phase, consistent with substrate channeling and implying that the observed tunnel is functionally relevant. Furthermore, the structure of reduced PutA complexed with menadione bisulfite reveals the elusive quinone-binding site. The benzoquinone binds within 4.0 Å of the flavin si face, consistent with direct electron transfer. The location of the quinone site implies that the concave surface of the PutA dimer approaches the membrane. Altogether, these results provide insight into how PutAs couple proline oxidation to quinone reduction.</p>

<p>Nucleoside analogue prodrugs are dependent on efficient intracellular stepwise phosphorylation to their triphosphate form to become therapeutically active. In many cases it is this activation pathway that largely determines the efficacy of the drug. To gain further understanding of the determinants for efficient conversion by the enzyme thymidylate kinase (TMPK) of clinically important thymidine monophosphate analogues to the corresponding diphosphates, we solved the crystal structures of the enzyme, with either ADP or the ATP analogue AppNHp at the phosphoryl donor site, in complex with TMP, AZTMP (previous work), NH2TMP, d4TMP, ddTMP, and FLTMP (this work) at the phosphoryl acceptor site. In conjunction with steady-state kinetic data, our structures shed light on the effect of 3'-substitutions in the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) sugar moiety on the catalytic rate. We observe a direct correlation between the rate of phosphorylation of an NMP and its ability to induce a closing of the enzyme's phosphate-binding loop (P-loop). Our results show the drastic effects that slight modifications of the substrates exert on the enzyme's conformation and, hence, activity and suggest the type of substitutions that are compatible with efficient phosphorylation by TMPK.</p>

<p>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a key regulator of many cellular signaling pathways. Unlike most kinases, GSK-3 is controlled by inhibition rather than by specific activation. In the insulin and several other signaling pathways, phosphorylation of a serine present in a conserved sequence near the amino terminus of GSK-3 generates an auto-inhibitory peptide. In contrast, Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction requires phosphorylation of Ser/Pro rich sequences present in the Wnt co-receptors LRP5/6, and these motifs inhibit GSK-3 activity. We present crystal structures of GSK-3 bound to its phosphorylated N-terminus and to two of the phosphorylated LRP6 motifs. A conserved loop unique to GSK-3 undergoes a dramatic conformational change that clamps the bound pseudo-substrate peptides, and reveals the mechanism of primed substrate recognition. The structures rationalize target sequence preferences and suggest avenues for the design of inhibitors selective for a subset of pathways regulated by GSK-3.

<p>Despite the similarity in the active site pockets of carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes I and II, the binding affinities of benzenesulfonamide inhibitors are invariably higher with CA II as compared to CA I. To explore the structural basis of this molecular recognition phenomenon, we have designed and synthesized simple benzenesulfonamide inhibitors substituted at the para position with positively charged, negatively charged, and neutral functional groups, and we have determined the affinities and X-ray crystal structures of their enzyme complexes. The para-substituents are designed to bind in the midsection of the 15 A deep active site cleft, where interactions with enzyme residues and solvent molecules are possible. We find that a para-substituted positively charged amino group is more poorly tolerated in the active site of CA I compared with CA II. In contrast, a para-substituted negatively charged carboxylate substituent is tolerated equally well in the active sites of both CA isozymes. Notably, enzyme-inhibitor affinity increases upon neutralization of inhibitor charged groups by amidation or esterification. These results inform the design of short molecular linkers connecting the benzenesulfonamide group and a para-substituted tail group in "two-prong" CA inhibitors: an optimal linker segment will be electronically neutral, yet capable of engaging in at least some hydrogen bond interactions with protein residues and/or solvent. Microcalorimetric data reveal that inhibitor binding to CA I is enthalpically less favorable and entropically more favorable than inhibitor binding to CA II. This contrasting behavior may arise in part from differences in active site desolvation and the conformational entropy of inhibitor binding to each isozyme active site.</p>

<p>Human 3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (3α-HSD3) has an essential role in the inactivation of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Notably, human 3α-HSD3 shares 97.8% sequence identity with human 20-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD) and there is only one amino acid difference (residue 54) that is located in their steroid binding pockets. However, 20α-HSD displays a distinctive ability in transforming progesterone to 20α-hydroxy-progesterone (20α-OHProg). In this study, to understand the role of residue 54 in the steroid binding and discrimination, the V54L mutation in human 3α-HSD3 has been created. We have solved two crystal structures of the 3α-HSD3·NADP(+)·Progesterone complex and the 3α-HSD3 V54L·NADP(+)·progesterone complex. Interestingly, progesterone adopts two different binding modes to form complexes within the wild type enzyme, with one binding mode similar to the orientation of a bile acid (ursodeoxycholate) in the reported ternary complex of human 3α-HSD3·NADP(+)·ursodeoxycholate and the other binding mode resembling the orientation of 20α-OHProg in the ternary complex of human 20α-HSD·NADP(+)·20α-OHProg. However, the V54L mutation directly restricts the steroid binding modes to a unique one, which resembles the orientation of 20α-OHProg within human 20α-HSD. Furthermore, the kinetic study has been carried out. The results show that the V54L mutation significantly decreases the 3α-HSD activity for the reduction of DHT, while this mutation enhances the 20α-HSD activity to convert progesterone. </p>

<p>Tankyrases are ADP-ribosyltransferases that play key roles in various cellular pathways, including the regulation of cell proliferation, and thus, they are promising drug targets for the treatment of cancer. Flavones have been shown to inhibit tankyrases and we report here the discovery of more potent and selective flavone derivatives. Commercially available flavones with single substitutions were used for structure-activity relationship studies, and cocrystal structures of the 18 hit compounds were analyzed to explain their potency and selectivity. The most potent inhibitors were also tested in a cell-based assay, which demonstrated that they effectively antagonize Wnt signaling. To assess selectivity, they were further tested against a panel of homologous human ADP-ribosyltransferases. The most effective compound, 22 (MN-64), showed 6 nM potency against tankyrase 1, isoenzyme selectivity, and Wnt signaling inhibition. This work forms a basis for rational development of flavones as tankyrase inhibitors and guides the development of other structurally related inhibitors. </p>

<p>The diheme enzyme MauG catalyzes a six-electron oxidation required for post-translational modification of a precursor of methylamine dehydrogenase (preMADH) to complete the biosynthesis of its protein-derived tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor. Crystallographic studies have implicated Glu113 in the formation of the bis-Fe(IV) state of MauG, in which one heme is Fe(IV)═O and the other is Fe(IV) with His-Tyr axial ligation. An E113Q mutation had no effect on the structure of MauG but significantly altered its redox properties. E113Q MauG could not be converted to the diferrous state by reduction with dithionite but was only reduced to a mixed valence Fe(II)/Fe(III) state, which is never observed in wild-type (WT) MauG. Addition of H2O2 to E113Q MauG generated a high valence state that formed more slowly and was less stable than the bis-Fe(IV) state of WT MauG. E113Q MauG exhibited no detectable TTQ biosynthesis activity in a steady-state assay with preMADH as the substrate. It did catalyze the steady-state oxidation of quinol MADH to the quinone, but 1000-fold less efficiently than WT MauG. Addition of H2O2 to a crystal of the E113Q MauG-preMADH complex resulted in partial synthesis of TTQ. Extended exposure of these crystals to H2O2 resulted in hydroxylation of Pro107 in the distal pocket of the high-spin heme. It is concluded that the loss of the carboxylic group of Glu113 disrupts the redox cooperativity between hemes that allows rapid formation of the diferrous state and alters the distribution of high-valence species that participate in charge-resonance stabilization of the bis-Fe(IV) redox state. </p>

<p>X-rays interact with biological matter and cause damage. Proteins and other macromolecules are damaged primarily by ionizing X-ray photons and secondarily by reactive radiolytic chemical species. In particular, protein molecules are damaged during X-ray diffraction experiments with protein crystals, which is, in many cases, a serious hindrance to structure solution. The local X-ray-induced structural changes of the protein molecule have been studied using a number of model systems. However, it is still not well understood whether these local chemical changes lead to global structural changes in protein and what the mechanism is. We present experimental evidence at atomic resolution indicating the movement of large parts of the protein globule together with bound water molecules in the early stages of radiation damage to the protein crystal. The data were obtained from a crystal cryocooled to approximately 100 K and diffracting to 1 A. The movement of the protein structural elements occurs simultaneously with the decarboxylation of several glutamate and aspartate residues that mediate contacts between moving protein structural elements and with the rearrangement of the water network. The analysis of the anisotropy of atomic displacement parameters reveals that the observed atomic movements occur at different rates in different unit cells of the crystal. Thus, the examination of the cooperative atomic movement enables us to better understand how radiation-induced local chemical and structural changes of the protein molecule eventually lead to disorder in protein crystals.</p>

<p>Homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase (FeHPCD) utilizes an active site Fe(II) to activate O(2) in a reaction cycle that ultimately results in aromatic ring cleavage. Here, the roles of the conserved active site residue Tyr257 are investigated by solving the X-ray crystal structures of the Tyr257-to-Phe variant (Y257F) in complex with the substrate homoprotocatechuate (HPCA) and the alternative substrate 4-nitrocatechol (4NC). These are compared with structures of the analogous wild type enzyme complexes. In addition, the oxy intermediate of the reaction cycle of Y257F-4NC + O(2) is formed in crystallo and structurally characterized. It is shown that both substrates adopt a previously unrecognized, slightly nonplanar, strained conformation affecting the geometries of all aromatic ring carbons when bound in the FeHPCD active site. This global deviation from planarity is not observed for the Y257F variant. In the Y257F-4NC-oxy complex, the O(2) is bound side-on to the Fe(II), while the 4NC is chelated in two adjacent sites. The ring of the 4NC in this complex is planar, in contrast to the equivalent FeHPCD intermediate, which exhibits substantial local distortion of the substrate hydroxyl moiety (C2-O(-)) that is hydrogen bonded to Tyr257. We propose that Tyr257 induces the global and local distortions of the substrate ring in two different ways. First, van der Waals conflict between the Tyr257-OH substituent and the substrate C2 carbon is relieved by adopting the globally strained structure. Second, Tyr257 stabilizes the localized out-of-plane position of the C2-O(-) by forming a stronger hydrogen bond as the distortion increases. Both types of distortions favor transfer of one electron out of the substrate to form a reactive semiquinone radical. Then, the localized distortion at substrate C2 promotes formation of the key alkylperoxo intermediate of the cycle resulting from oxygen attack on the activated substrate at C2, which becomes sp(3) hybridized. The inability of Y257F to promote the distorted substrate structure may explain the observed 100-fold decrease in the rates of the O(2) activation and insertion steps of the reaction.</p>

The movement of the protein structural elements occurs simultaneously with the decarboxylation of several glutamate and aspartate residues that mediate contacts between moving protein structural elements and with the rearrangement of the water network. The analysis of the anisotropy of atomic displacement parameters reveals that the observed atomic movements occur at different rates in different unit cells of the crystal. Thus, the examination of the cooperative atomic movement enables us to better understand how radiation-induced local chemical and structural changes of the protein molecule eventually lead to disorder in protein crystals.</p>

<p>X-rays interact with biological matter and cause damage. Proteins and other macromolecules are damaged primarily by ionizing X-ray photons and secondarily by reactive radiolytic chemical species. In particular, protein molecules are damaged during X-ray diffraction experiments with protein crystals, which is, in many cases, a serious hindrance to structure solution. The local X-ray-induced structural changes of the protein molecule have been studied using a number of model systems. However, it is still not well understood whether these local chemical changes lead to global structural changes in protein and what the mechanism is.

<p>Homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase (FeHPCD) utilizes an active site Fe(II) to activate O(2) in a reaction cycle that ultimately results in aromatic ring cleavage. Here, the roles of the conserved active site residue Tyr257 are investigated by solving the X-ray crystal structures of the Tyr257-to-Phe variant (Y257F) in complex with the substrate homoprotocatechuate (HPCA) and the alternative substrate 4-nitrocatechol (4NC). These are compared with structures of the analogous wild type enzyme complexes. In addition, the oxy intermediate of the reaction cycle of Y257F-4NC + O(2) is formed in crystallo and structurally characterized. It is shown that both substrates adopt a previously unrecognized, slightly nonplanar, strained conformation affecting the geometries of all aromatic ring carbons when bound in the FeHPCD active site. This global deviation from planarity is not observed for the Y257F variant. In the Y257F-4NC-oxy complex, the O(2) is bound side-on to the Fe(II), while the 4NC is chelated in two adjacent sites. The ring of the 4NC in this complex is planar, in contrast to the equivalent FeHPCD intermediate, which exhibits substantial local distortion of the substrate hydroxyl moiety (C2-O(-)) that is hydrogen bonded to Tyr257. We propose that Tyr257 induces the global and local distortions of the substrate ring in two different ways. First, van der Waals conflict between the Tyr257-OH substituent and the substrate C2 carbon is relieved by adopting the globally strained structure. Second, Tyr257 stabilizes the localized out-of-plane position of the C2-O(-) by forming a stronger hydrogen bond as the distortion increases. Both types of distortions favor transfer of one electron out of the substrate to form a reactive semiquinone radical. Then, the localized distortion at substrate C2 promotes formation of the key alkylperoxo intermediate of the cycle resulting from oxygen attack on the activated substrate at C2, which becomes sp(3) hybridized. The inability of Y257F to promote the distorted substrate structure may explain the observed 100-fold decrease in the rates of the O(2) activation and insertion steps of the reaction.</p>

<p>The phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are metal ion-dependent enzymes that regulate cellular signaling by metabolic inactivation of the ubiquitous second messengers cAMP and cGMP. In this role, the PDEs are involved in many biological and metabolic processes and are proven targets of successful drugs for the treatments of a wide range of diseases. However, because of the rapidity of the hydrolysis reaction, an experimental knowledge of the enzymatic mechanisms of the PDEs at the atomic level is still lacking. Here, we report the structures of reaction intermediates accumulated at the reaction steady state in PDE9/crystal and preserved by freeze-trapping. These structures reveal the catalytic process of a PDE and explain the substrate specificity of PDE9 in an actual reaction and the cation requirements of PDEs in general.</p>

<p>Here we describe the crystal structures of the NAD kinase (LmNADK1) from Listeria monocytogenes in complex with its substrate NAD, its product NADP, or two synthesized NAD mimics. We identified one of the NAD mimics, di-adenosine diphosphate, as a new substrate for LmNADK1, whereas we showed that the closely related compound di-5'-thioadenosine is a novel non-natural inhibitor for this enzyme. These structures suggest a mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis. Indeed, sequence/structure comparison and directed mutagenesis have previously shown that NAD kinases (NADKs) and the distantly related 6-phosphofructokinases share the same catalytically important GGDGT motif. However, in this study we have shown that these enzymes use the central aspartate of this motif differently. Although this acidic residue chelates the catalytic Mg(2+) ion in 6-phosphofructokinases, it activates the phospho-acceptor (NAD) in NADKs. Sequence/structure comparisons suggest that the role of this aspartate would be conserved in NADKs and the related sphingosine and diacylglycerol kinases.</p>

<p>Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP; RNase 3) is a human ribonuclease found only in eosinophil leukocytes that belongs to the RNase A superfamily. This enzyme is bactericidal, helminthotoxic and cytotoxic to mammalian cells and tissues. The protein has been cloned, heterologously overexpressed, purified and crystallized. Its crystal structure has been determined and refined using data up to 1. 75 A resolution. The molecule displays the alpha+beta folding topology typical for members of the ribonuclease A superfamily. The catalytic active site residues are conserved with respect to other ribonucleases of the superfamily but some differences appear at substrate recognition subsites, which may account, in part, for the low catalytic activity. Most strikingly, 19 surface-located arginine residues confer a strong basic character to the protein. The high concentration of positive charges and the particular orientation of the side-chains of these residues may also be related to the low activity of ECP as a ribonuclease and provides an explanation for its unique cytotoxic role through cell membrane disruption.</p>

<p>Aspartyl aminopeptidase (DNPEP), with specificity towards an acidic amino acid at the N-terminus, is the only mammalian member among the poorly understood M18 peptidases. DNPEP has implicated roles in protein and peptide metabolism, as well as the renin-angiotensin system in blood pressure regulation. Despite previous enzyme and substrate characterization, structural details of DNPEP regarding ligand recognition and catalytic mechanism remain to be delineated.</p>

<p>In bacterial cells, processing of double-stranded DNA breaks for repair by homologous recombination is dependent upon the recombination hotspot sequence Chi and is catalysed by either an AddAB- or RecBCD-type helicase-nuclease. Here, we report the crystal structure of AddAB bound to DNA. The structure allows identification of a putative Chi-recognition site in an inactivated helicase domain of the AddB subunit. By generating mutant protein complexes that do not respond to Chi, we show that residues responsible for Chi recognition are located in positions equivalent to the signature motifs of a conventional helicase. Comparison with the related RecBCD complex, which recognizes a different Chi sequence, provides further insight into the structural basis for sequence-specific ssDNA recognition. The structure suggests a simple mechanism for DNA break processing, explains how AddAB and RecBCD can accomplish the same overall reaction with different sets of functional modules and reveals details of the role of an Fe-S cluster in protein stability and DNA binding.</p>

<p>This is the first crystal structure of a carbohydrate induced dimer of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)). This is an endogenous complex formed between two PLA(2) molecules and two mannoses. It was isolated from Krait venom (Bungarus caeruleus) and crystallized as such. The complete amino acid sequence of PLA(2) was determined using cDNA method. Three-dimensional structure of the complex has been solved with molecular replacement method and refined to a final R-factor of 0.192 for all the data in the resolution range 20.0-2.1A. The presence of mannose molecules in the protein crystals was confirmed using dinitrosalicylic acid test and the molecular weight of the dimer was verified with MALDI-TOF. As indicated by dynamic light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation the dimer was also stable in solution. The good quality non-protein electron density at the interface of two PLA(2) molecules enabled us to model two mannoses. The mannoses are involved extensively in interactions with protein atoms of both PLA(2) molecules. Some of the critical amino acid residues such as Asp 49 and Tyr 31, which are part of the substrate-binding site, are found facing the interface and interacting with mannoses. The structure of the complex clearly shows that the dimerization is caused by mannoses and it results in the loss of enzymatic activity.</p>

<p>Activated RAS GTPase signalling is a critical driver of oncogenic transformation and malignant disease. Cellular models of RAS-dependent cancers have been used to identify experimental small molecules, such as SCH51344, but their molecular mechanism of action remains generally unknown. Here, using a chemical proteomic approach, we identify the target of SCH51344 as the human mutT homologue MTH1 (also known as NUDT1), a nucleotide pool sanitizing enzyme. Loss-of-function of MTH1 impaired growth of KRAS tumour cells, whereas MTH1 overexpression mitigated sensitivity towards SCH51344. Searching for more drug-like inhibitors, we identified the kinase inhibitor crizotinib as a nanomolar suppressor of MTH1 activity. Surprisingly, the clinically used (R)-enantiomer of the drug was inactive, whereas the (S)-enantiomer selectively inhibited MTH1 catalytic activity. Enzymatic assays, chemical proteomic profiling, kinome-wide activity surveys and MTH1 co-crystal structures of both enantiomers provide a rationale for this remarkable stereospecificity. Disruption of nucleotide pool homeostasis via MTH1 inhibition by (S)-crizotinib induced an increase in DNA single-strand breaks, activated DNA repair in human colon carcinoma cells, and effectively suppressed tumour growth in animal models. Our results propose (S)-crizotinib as an attractive chemical entity for further pre-clinical evaluation, and small-molecule inhibitors of MTH1 in general as a promising novel class of anticancer agents. </p>

<p>Polyamine oxidase (PAO) carries out the FAD-dependent oxidation of the secondary amino groups of spermidine and spermine, a key reaction in the polyamine catabolism. The active site of PAO consists of a 30 A long U-shaped catalytic tunnel, whose innermost part is located in front of the flavin ring. To provide insight into the PAO substrate specificity and amine oxidation mechanism, we have investigated the crystal structure of maize PAO in the reduced state and in complex with three different inhibitors, guazatine, 1,8-diaminooctane, and N(1)-ethyl-N(11)-[(cycloheptyl)methyl]-4,8-diazaundecane (CHENSpm). In the reduced state, the conformation of the isoalloxazine ring and the surrounding residues is identical to that of the oxidized enzyme. Only Lys300 moves away from the flavin to compensate for the change in cofactor protonation occurring upon reduction. The structure of the PAO.inhibitor complexes reveals an exact match between the inhibitors and the PAO catalytic tunnel. Inhibitor binding does not involve any protein conformational change. Such lock-and-key binding occurs also in the complex with CHENSpm, which forms a covalent adduct with the flavin N5 atom. Comparison of the enzyme complexes hints at an "out-of-register" mechanism of inhibition, in which the inhibitor secondary amino groups are not properly aligned with respect to the flavin to allow oxidation. Except for the Glu62-Glu170 pair, no negatively charged residues are involved in the recognition of substrate and inhibitor amino groups, which is in contrast to other polyamine binding proteins. This feature may be exploited in the design of drugs specifically targeting PAO.</p>

<p>New structures of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcribing complexes reveal a likely key to transcription. The trigger loop swings beneath a correct nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) in the nucleotide addition site, closing off the active center and forming an extensive network of interactions with the NTP base, sugar, phosphates, and additional pol II residues. A histidine side chain in the trigger loop, precisely positioned by these interactions, may literally "trigger" phosphodiester bond formation. Recognition and catalysis are thus coupled, ensuring the fidelity of transcription.</p>

<p>Protein function often depends on the exchange between conformational substates. Allosteric ligand binding or distal mutations can stabilize specific active-site conformations and consequently alter protein function. Observing alternative conformations at low levels of electron density, in addition to comparison of independently determined X-ray crystal structures, can provide mechanistic insights into conformational dynamics. Here we report a new algorithm, CONTACT, that identifies contact networks of conformationally heterogeneous residues directly from high-resolution X-ray crystallography data. Contact networks determined for Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) predict the observed long-range pattern of NMR chemical shift perturbations of an allosteric mutation. A comparison of contact networks in wild-type and mutant ecDHFR suggests that mutations that alter optimized contact networks of coordinated motions can impair catalytic function. CONTACT-guided mutagenesis can exploit the structure-dynamics-function relationship in protein engineering and design. </p>

<p>This paper describes two SlipChip-based approaches to protein crystallization: a SlipChip-based free interface diffusion (FID) method and a SlipChip-based composite method that simultaneously performs microbatch and FID crystallization methods in a single device. The FID SlipChip was designed to screen multiple reagents, each at multiple diffusion equilibration times, and was validated by screening conditions for crystallization of two proteins, enoyl-CoA hydratase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate synthase from Babesia bovis, against 48 different reagents at five different equilibration times each, consuming 12 microL of each protein for a total of 480 experiments using three SlipChips. The composite SlipChip was designed to screen multiple reagents, each at multiple mixing ratios and multiple equilibration times, and was validated by screening conditions for crystallization of two proteins, enoyl-CoA hydratase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate synthase from Babesia bovis. To prevent cross-contamination while keeping the solution in the neck channels for FID stable, the plates of the SlipChip were etched with a pattern of nanowells. This nanopattern was used to increase the contact angle of aqueous solutions on the surface of the silanized glass. The composite SlipChip increased the number of successful crystallization conditions and identified more conditions for crystallization than separate FID and microbatch screenings. Crystallization experiments were scaled up in well plates using conditions identified during the SlipChip screenings, and X-ray diffraction data were obtained to yield the protein structure of dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate synthase at 1.95 A resolution. This free-interface diffusion approach provides a convenient and high-throughput method of setting up gradients in microfluidic devices and may find additional applications in cell-based assays.</p>

<p>Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKO) is a flavoenzyme, which irreversibly degrades the plant hormones cytokinins and thereby participates in their homeostasis. Several synthetic cytokinins including urea derivatives are known CKO inhibitors but structural data explaining enzyme-inhibitor interactions are lacking. Thus, an inhibitory study with numerous urea derivatives was undertaken using the maize enzyme (ZmCKO1) and the crystal structure of ZmCKO1 in a complex with N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU) was solved. CPPU binds in a planar conformation and competes for the same binding site with natural substrates like N(6)-(2-isopentenyl)adenine (iP) and zeatin (Z). Nitrogens at the urea backbone are hydrogen bonded to the putative active site base Asp169. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis of L492 and E381 residues involved in the inhibitor binding was performed. The crystal structures of L492A mutant in a complex with CPPU and N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-benzylurea (CPBU) were solved and confirm the importance of a stacking interaction between the 2-chloro-4-pyridinyl ring of the inhibitor and the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor. Amino derivatives like N-(2-amino-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (APPU) inhibited ZmCKO1 more efficiently than CPPU, as opposed to the inhibition of E381A/S mutants, emphasizing the importance of this residue for inhibitor binding. As highly specific CKO inhibitors without undesired side effects are of major interest for physiological studies, all studied compounds were further analyzed for cytokinin activity in the Amaranthus bioassay and for binding to the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors AHK3 and AHK4. By contrast to CPPU itself, APPU and several benzylureas bind only negligibly to the receptors and exhibit weak cytokinin activity.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of mistletoe lectin I (ML-I) isolated from the European mistletoe Viscum album in complex with the most active phytohormone zeatin has been analyzed and refined to 2.54 A resolution. X-ray suitable crystals of ML-I were obtained by the counter-diffusion method using the Gel-Tube R crystallization kit (GT-R) onboard the Russian Service Module on the international space station ISS. High quality hexagonal bipyramidal crystals were grown during 3 months under microgravity conditions. Selected crystals were soaked in a saturated solution of zeatin and subsequently diffraction data were collected applying synchrotron radiation. A distinct F(o)-F(c) electron density has been found inside a binding pocket located in subunit B of ML-I and has been interpreted as a single zeatin molecule. The structure was refined to investigate the zeatin-ML-I interactions in detail. The results demonstrate the ability of mistletoe to protect itself from the host transpiration regulation by absorbing the most active host plant hormones as part of a defense mechanism.</p>

<p>Ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is the second enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway, which is found in plants, fungi and bacteria but not in animals. This difference in metabolism between animals and microorganisms makes KARI an attractive target for the development of antimicrobial agents. Herein we report the crystal structure of Escherichia coli KARI in complex with Mg(2+) and NADPH at 2.3Å resolution. Ultracentrifugation studies confirm that the enzyme exists as a tetramer in solution, and isothermal titration calorimetry shows that the binding of Mg(2+) increases structural disorder while the binding of NADPH increases the structural rigidity of the enzyme. Comparison of the structure of the E. coli KARI-Mg(2+)-NADPH complex with that of enzyme in the absence of cofactors shows that the binding of Mg(2+) and NADPH opens the interface between the N- and C-domains, thereby allowing access for the substrates to bind: the existence of only a small opening between the domains in the crystal structure of the unliganded enzyme signifies restricted access to the active site. This observation contrasts with that in the plant enzyme, where the N-domain can rotate freely with respect to the C-domain until the binding of Mg(2+) and/or NADPH stabilizes the relative positions of these domains. Support is thereby provided for the idea that plant and bacterial KARIs have evolved different mechanisms of induced fit to prepare the active site for catalysis.</p>

<p>Two groups of benzenesulfonamide derivatives, bearing pyrimidine moieties, were designed and synthesized as inhibitors of carbonic anhydrases (CA). Their binding affinities to six recombinant human CA isoforms I, II, VI, VII, XII, and XIII were determined by the thermal shift assay (TSA). The binding of several inhibitors was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Direct demonstration of compound inhibition was achieved by determining the inhibition constant by stopped-flow CO2 hydration assay. The most potent compounds demonstrated selectivity towards isoform I and affinities of 0.5 nM. The crystal structures of selected compounds in complex with CA II, XII, and XIII were determined to atomic resolution. Compounds described here were compared with previously published pyrimidinebenzenesulfonamides.(1) Systematic structure-activity analysis of 40 compound interactions with six isoforms yields clues for the design of compounds with greater affinities and selectivities towards target CA isoforms.</p>

<p>Glutaraldehyde has been used for several decades as an effective crosslinking agent for many applications including sample fixation for microscopy, enzyme and cell immobilization, and stabilization of protein crystals. Despite of its common use as a crosslinking agent, the mechanism and chemistry involved in glutaraldehyde crosslinking reaction is not yet fully understood. Here we describe feasibility study and results obtained from a new approach to investigate the process of protein crystals stabilization by glutaraldehyde crosslinking. It involves exposure of a model protein crystal (Lysozyme) to glutaraldehyde in alkaline or acidic pH for different incubation periods and reaction arrest by medium exchange with crystallization medium to remove unbound glutaraldehyde. The crystals were subsequently incubated in diluted buffer affecting dissolution of un-crosslinked crystals. Samples from the resulting solution were subjected to protein composition analysis by gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy while crosslinked, dissolution resistant crystals were subjected to high resolution X-ray structural analysis. Data from gel electrophoresis indicated that the crosslinking process starts at specific preferable crosslinking site by lysozyme dimer formation, for both acidic and alkaline pH values. These dimer formations were followed by trimer and tetramer formations leading eventually to dissolution resistant crystals. The crosslinking initiation site and the end products obtained from glutaraldehyde crosslinking in both pH ranges resulted from reactions between lysine residues of neighboring protein molecules and the polymeric form of glutaraldehyde. Reaction rate was much faster at alkaline pH. Different reaction end products, indicating different reaction mechanisms, were identified for crosslinking taking place under alkaline or acidic conditions.</p>

<p>We present a combined experimental and modeling study of organic ligand molecules binding to a slightly polar engineered cavity site in T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). For modeling, we computed alchemical absolute binding free energies. These were blind tests performed prospectively on 13 diverse, previously untested candidate ligand molecules. We predicted that eight compounds would bind to the cavity and five would not; 11 of 13 predictions were correct at this level. The RMS error to the measurable absolute binding energies was 1.8 kcal/mol. In addition, we computed "relative" binding free energies for six phenol derivatives starting from two known ligands: phenol and catechol. The average RMS error in the relative free energy prediction was 2.5 kcal/mol (phenol) and 1.1 kcal/mol (catechol). To understand these results at atomic resolution, we obtained x-ray co-complex structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol analogs. The average RMSD of the predicted pose to the experiment was 2.0 A (diverse set), 1.8 A (phenol-derived predictions), and 1.2 A (catechol-derived predictions). We found that predicting accurate affinities and rank-orderings required near-native starting orientations of the ligand in the binding site. Unanticipated binding modes, multiple ligand binding, and protein conformational change all proved challenging for the free energy methods. We believe that these results can help guide future improvements in physics-based absolute binding free energy methods.</p>

<p>Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are membrane-associated proteins that catalyze the final step of murein biosynthesis. These proteins function as either transpeptidases or carboxypeptidases and in a few cases demonstrate transglycosylase activity. Both transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities of PBPs occur at the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of a murein precursor containing a disaccharide pentapeptide comprising N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetyl-muramic acid-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala. Beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit these enzymes by competing with the pentapeptide precursor for binding to the active site of the enzyme. Here we describe the crystal structure, biochemical characteristics, and expression profile of PBP4, a low-molecular-mass PBP from Staphylococcus aureus strain COL. The crystal structures of PBP4-antibiotic complexes reported here were determined by molecular replacement, using the atomic coordinates deposited by the New York Structural Genomics Consortium. While the pbp4 gene is not essential for the viability of S. aureus, the knockout phenotype of this gene is characterized by a marked reduction in cross-linked muropeptide and increased vancomycin resistance. Unlike other PBPs, we note that expression of PBP4 was not substantially altered under different experimental conditions, nor did it change across representative hospital- or community-associated strains of S. aureus that were examined. In vitro data on purified recombinant S. aureus PBP4 suggest that it is a beta-lactamase and is not trapped as an acyl intermediate with beta-lactam antibiotics. Put together, the expression analysis and biochemical features of PBP4 provide a framework for understanding the function of this protein in S. aureus and its role in antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<p>The sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) has a key role in the pathogenesis of a select number of neuroinvasive bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis. These pathogens coat themselves with polysialic acids, mimicking the exterior surface of mammalian cells and consequentially concealing the bacteria from the host's immune system. NANA is synthesized in bacteria by the homodimeric enzyme NANA synthase (NANAS), which catalyzes a condensation reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). NANAS is closely related to the α-keto acid synthases 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase and 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase. NANAS differs from these enzymes in that it contains an antifreeze protein like (AFPL) domain, which extends from the C-terminal of the (β/α)8 barrel containing the active site and contributes a highly conserved arginine (Arg314) into the active site of the opposing monomer chain. We have investigated the role of Arg314 in NmeNANAS through mutagenesis and a combination of kinetic and structural analyses. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular modeling, we have shown that Arg314 is required for the catalytic function of NANAS and that the delocalized positively charged guanidinium functionality of this residue provides steering of the sugar substrate ManNAc for suitable placement in the active site and thus reaction with PEP.</p>

<p>The 6-phospho-β-glucosidase BglA-2 (EC 3.2.1.86) from glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH-1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-1,4-linked cellobiose 6-phosphate (cellobiose-6'P) to yield glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. Both reaction products are further metabolized by the energy-generating glycolytic pathway. Here, we present the first crystal structures of the apo and complex forms of BglA-2 with thiocellobiose-6'P (a non-metabolizable analog of cellobiose-6'P) at 2.0 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively. Similar to other GH-1 enzymes, the overall structure of BglA-2 from Streptococcus pneumoniae adopts a typical (β/α)8 TIM-barrel, with the active site located at the center of the convex surface of the β-barrel. Structural analyses, in combination with enzymatic data obtained from site-directed mutant proteins, suggest that three aromatic residues, Tyr(126), Tyr(303), and Trp(338), at subsite +1 of BglA-2 determine substrate specificity with respect to 1,4-linked 6-phospho-β-glucosides. Moreover, three additional residues, Ser(424), Lys(430), and Tyr(432) of BglA-2, were found to play important roles in the hydrolytic selectivity toward phosphorylated rather than non-phosphorylated compounds. Comparative structural analysis suggests that a tryptophan versus a methionine/alanine residue at subsite -1 may contribute to the catalytic and substrate selectivity with respect to structurally similar 6-phospho-β-galactosidases and 6-phospho-β-glucosidases assigned to the GH-1 family.</p>

<p>During our efforts to characterize the regulatory properties of human liver pyruvate kinase (L-PYK), we have noted that the affinity of the protein for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) becomes reduced several days after cell lysis. A 1.8 Å crystallographic structure of L-PYK with the S12D mimic of phosphorylation indicates that Cys436 is oxidized, the first potential insight into explaining the effect of "aging". Interestingly, the oxidation is only to sulfenic acid despite the crystal growth time period of 2 weeks. Mutagenesis confirms that the side chain of residue 436 is energetically coupled to PEP binding. Mass spectrometry confirms that the oxidation is present in solution and is not an artifact caused by X-ray exposure. Exposure of the L-PYK mutations to H₂O₂ also confirms that PEP affinity is sensitive to the nature of the side chain at position 436. A 1.95 Å structure of the C436M mutant of L-PYK, the only mutation at position 436 that has been shown to strengthen PEP affinity, revealed that the methionine substitution results in the ordering of several N-terminal residues that have not been ordered in previous structures. This result allowed speculation that oxidation of Cys436 and phosphorylation of the N-terminus at Ser12 may function through a similar mechanism, namely the interruption of an activating interaction between the nonphosphorylated N-terminus with the nonoxidized main body of the protein. Mutant cycles were used to provide evidence that mutations of Cys436 are energetically synergistic with N-terminal modifications, a result that is consistent with phosphorylation of the N-terminus and oxidation of Cys436 functioning through mechanisms with common features. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to confirm that the newly ordered N-terminal residues were important to the regulation of enzyme function by the N-terminus of the enzyme (i.e., not an artifact caused by the introduced methionine substitution) and to further define which residues in the N-terminus are energetically coupled to PEP affinity. Collectively, these studies indicate energetic coupling (and potentially mechanistic similarities) between the oxidation of Cys436 and phosphorylation of Ser12 in the N-terminus of L-PYK.</p>

<p>The mouse 17alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (m17alpha-HSD) is the unique known member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily able to catalyze efficiently and in a stereospecific manner the conversion of androstenedione (Delta4) into epi-testosterone (epi-T), the 17alpha-epimer of testosterone. Structural and mutagenic studies had already identified one of the residues delineating the steroid-binding cavity, A24, as the major molecular determinant for the stereospecificity of m17alpha-HSD. We report here a ternary complex crystal structure (m17alpha-HSD:NADP(+):epi-T) determined at 1.85 A resolution that confirms this and reveals a unique steroid-binding mode for an AKR enzyme. Indeed, in addition to the interactions found in all other AKRs (van der Waals contacts stabilizing the core of the steroid and the hydrogen bonds established at the catalytic site by the Y55 and H117 residues with the oxygen atom of the ketone group to be reduced), m17alpha-HSD establishes with the other extremity of the steroid nucleus an additional interaction involving K31. By combining direct mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we found that the elimination of this hydrogen bond did not affect the affinity of the enzyme for its steroid substrate but led to a slight but significant increase of its catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)), suggesting a role for K31 in the release of the steroidal product at the end of the reaction. This previously unobserved steroid-binding mode for an AKR is similar to that adopted by other steroid-binding proteins, the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family and the steroid hormone nuclear receptors. Mutagenesis and structural studies made on the human type 3 3alpha-HSD, a closely related enzyme that shares 73% amino acids identity with the m17alpha-HSD, also revealed that the residue at position 24 of these two enzymes directly affects the binding and/or the release of NADPH, in addition to its role in their 17alpha/17beta stereospecificity.</p>

<p>Dominant inheritance of point mutations in CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is the best characterized subset of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) and accounts for some 20% of the known familial cases.

<p>In vertebrates, membrane-bound ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) on the cell surface are responsible for signal conversion and termination in purinergic signaling by extracellular nucleotides. Here we present apo and complex structures of the rat NTPDase2 extracellular domain and Legionella pneumophila NTPDase1, including a high-resolution structure with a transition-state analog. Comparison of ATP and ADP binding modes shows how NTPDases engage the same catalytic site for hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates. We find that this dual specificity is achieved at the expense of base specificity. Structural and mutational studies indicate that a conserved active-site water is replaced by the phosphate product immediately after phosphoryl transfer. Partial base specificity for purines in LpNTPDase1 is based on a different intersubunit base binding site for pyrimidine bases. A comparison of the bacterial enzyme in six independent crystal forms shows that NTPDases can undergo a domain closure motion of at least 17°. </p>

<p>The bacterial hyaluronan lyases (Hyals) that degrade hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix, are involved in microbial spread. Inhibitors of these enzymes are essential in investigation of the role of hyaluronan and Hyal in bacterial infections and constitute a new class of antibiotics against Hyal-producing bacteria. Recently, we identified 1,3-diacetylbenzimidazole-2-thione and related molecules as inhibitors of streptococcal Hyal. One of such compounds, 1-decyl-2-(4-sulfamoyloxyphenyl)-1-indol-6-yl sulfamate, was co-crystallized in a complex with Streptococcus pneumoniae Hyal and its structure elucidated. The resultant X-ray structure demonstrates that this inhibitor fits in the enzymatic active site via interactions resembling the binding mode of the natural hyaluronan substrate. X-ray structural analysis also indicates binding interactions with the catalytic residues and those of a catalytically essential hydrophobic patch. An IC50 value of 11 microM for Hyal from Streptococcus agalactiae (strain 4755) qualifies this phenylindole compound as one of the most potent Hyal inhibitors known to date. The structural data suggested a similar binding mode for N-(3-phenylpropionyl)-benzoxazole-2-thione. This new compound's inhibitory properties were confirmed resulting in discovery of yet another Hyal inhibitor (IC50 of 15 microM). These benzoxazole-2-thiones constitute a new class of inhibitors of bacterial Hyals and are well suited for further optimization of their selectivity, potency, and pharmacokinetic properties.</p>

<p>We report the discovery, synthesis, and crystallographic binding mode of novel furanopyrimidine and pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitors of the Chk1 kinase, an oncology target. These inhibitors are synthetically tractable and inhibit Chk1 by competing for its ATP site. A chronological account allows an objective comparison of modeled compound docking modes to the subsequently obtained crystal structures. The comparison provides insights regarding the interpretation of modeling results, in relationship to the multiple reasonable docking modes which may be obtained in a kinase-ATP site. The crystal structures were used to guide medicinal chemistry efforts. This led to a thorough characterization of a pair of ligand-protein complexes which differ by a single hydrogen bond. An analysis indicates that this hydrogen bond is expected to contribute a fraction of the 10-fold change in binding affinity, adding a valuable observation to the debate about the energetic role of hydrogen bonding in molecular recognition.</p>

<p>Malyl-CoA lyase (MCL) is a promiscuous carbon-carbon bond lyase that catalyzes the reversible cleavage of structurally related Coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters.

<p>Bisphosphonates (BPs) are a class of compounds that have been used extensively in the treatment of osteoporosis and malignancy-related hypercalcemia. Some of these compounds act through inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), a key enzyme in the synthesis of isoprenoids. Recently, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) used in bone resorption therapy have been shown to be active against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), suggesting that they may be used as anti-trypanosomal agents. The crystal structures of TcFPPS in complex with substrate (isopentenyl diphosphate, IPP) and five N-BP inhibitors show that the C-1 hydroxyl and the nitrogen-containing groups of the inhibitors alter the binding of IPP and the conformation of two TcFPPS residues, Tyr94 and Gln167. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments suggest that binding of the first N-BPs to the homodimeric TcFPPS changes the binding properties of the second site. This mechanism of binding of N-BPs to TcFPPS is different to that reported for the binding of the same compounds to human FPPS. Proteins 2010. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>

<p>The structure of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase encoded by Arabidopsis thaliana gene At3g03250 has been solved to a nominal resolution of 1.86 Angstroms. In addition, the structure has been solved in the presence of the substrates/products UTP and UDP-glucose to nominal resolutions of 1.64 Angstroms and 1.85 Angstroms. The three structures revealed a catalytic domain similar to that of other nucleotidyl-glucose pyrophosphorylases with a carboxy-terminal beta-helix domain in a unique orientation. Conformational changes are observed between the native and substrate-bound complexes. The nucleotide-binding loop and the carboxy-terminal domain, including the suspected catalytically important Lys360, move in and out of the active site in a concerted fashion. TLS refinement was employed initially to model conformational heterogeneity in the UDP-glucose complex followed by the use of multiconformer refinement for the entire molecule. Normal mode analysis generated atomic displacement predictions in good agreement in magnitude and direction with the observed conformational changes and anisotropic displacement parameters generated by TLS refinement. The structures and the observed dynamic changes provide insight into the ordered mechanism of this enzyme and previously described oligomerization effects on catalytic activity.</p>

<p>Hexameric helicases couple ATP hydrolysis to processive separation of nucleic acid duplexes, a process critical for gene expression, DNA replication, and repair. All hexameric helicases fall into two families with opposing translocation polarities: the 3'--&gt;5' AAA+ and 5'--&gt;3' RecA-like enzymes. To understand how a RecA-like hexameric helicase engages and translocates along substrate, we determined the structure of the E. coli Rho transcription termination factor bound to RNA and nucleotide. Interior nucleic acid-binding elements spiral around six bases of RNA in a manner unexpectedly reminiscent of an AAA+ helicase, the papillomavirus E1 protein. Four distinct ATP-binding states, representing potential catalytic intermediates, are coupled to RNA positioning through a complex allosteric network. Comparative studies with E1 suggest that RecA and AAA+ hexameric helicases use different portions of their chemomechanical cycle for translocating nucleic acid and track in opposite directions by reversing the firing order of ATPase sites around the hexameric ring.

<p>A nitroxide side chain (R1) has been substituted at single sites along a helix-turn-helix motif in T4 lysozyme (residues 114-135). Together with previously published data, the new sites reported complete a continuous scan through the motif. Mutants with R1 at sites 115 and 118 were selected for crystallographic analysis to identify the structural origins of the corresponding two-component EPR spectra. At 115, R1 is shown to occupy two rotamers in the room temperature crystal structure, one of which has not been previously reported. The two components in the EPR spectrum apparently arise from differential interactions of the two rotamers with the surrounding structure, the most important of which is a hydrophobic interaction of the nitroxide ring. Interestingly, the crystal structure at 100 K reveals a single rotamer, emphasizing the possibility of rotamer selection in low-temperature crystal structures. Residue 118 is at a solvent-inaccessible site in the protein core, and the structure of 118R1, the first reported for the R1 side chain at a buried site, reveals how the side chain is accommodated in an overpacked core.</p>

<p>We examined the catalytic cycle of transaldolase (TAL) from Thermoplasma acidophilum by cryocrystallography and were able to structurally characterize--for the first time, to our knowledge--different genuine TAL reaction intermediates. These include the Schiff base adducts formed between the catalytic lysine and the donor ketose substrates fructose-6-phosphate and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate as well as the Michaelis complex with acceptor aldose erythrose-4-phosphate. These structural snapshots necessitate a revision of the accepted reaction mechanism with respect to functional roles of active site residues, and they further reveal fundamental insights into the general structural features of enzymatic Schiff base intermediates and the role of conformational dynamics in enzyme catalysis, substrate binding and discrimination. A nonplanar arrangement of the substituents around the Schiff base double bond was observed, suggesting that a structurally encoded reactant-state destabilization is a driving force of catalysis. Protein dynamics and the intrinsic hydrogen-bonding pattern appear to be crucial for selective recognition and binding of ketose as first substrate.</p>

<p>The Tyr35--&gt;Gly replacement in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) has previously been shown to dramatically enhance the flexibility of the trypsin-binding region of the free inhibitor and to destabilize the interaction with the protease by about 3 kcal/mol. The effects of this replacement on the enzyme-inhibitor interaction were further studied here by X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The co-crystal structure of Y35G BPTI bound to trypsin was determined using 1.65 A resolution X-ray diffraction data collected from cryopreserved crystals, and a new structure of the complex with wild-type BPTI under the same conditions was determined using 1.62 A data. These structures reveal that, in contrast to the free protein, Y35G BPTI adopts a conformation nearly identical with that of the wild-type protein, with a water-filled cavity in place of the missing Tyr side-chain. The crystallographic temperature factors for the two complexes indicate that the mutant inhibitor is nearly as rigid as the wild-type protein when bound to trypsin. Calorimetric measurements show that the change in enthalpy upon dissociation of the complex is 2.5 kcal/mol less favorable for the complex containing Y35G BPTI than for the complex with the wild-type inhibitor. Thus, the destabilization of the complex resulting from the Y35G replacement is due to a more favorable change in entropy upon dissociation. The heat capacity changes for dissociation of the mutant and wild-type complexes were very similar, suggesting that the entropic effects probably do not arise from solvation effects, but are more likely due to an increase in protein conformational entropy upon dissociation of the mutant inhibitor. These results define the biophysical role of a highly conserved core residue located outside of a protein-binding interface, demonstrating that Tyr35 has little impact on the trypsin-bound BPTI structure and acts primarily to define the structure of the free protein so as to maximize binding affinity.</p>

<p>One of the serious bottlenecks in structural genomics projects is overexpression of the target proteins in soluble form. We have applied the directed evolution technique and prepared soluble mutants of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2002 gene product, the wild type of which had been expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. A triple mutant I6TV47MT69K (Rv2002-M3) was chosen for structural and functional characterizations. Enzymatic assays indicate that the Rv2002-M3 protein has a high catalytic activity as a NADH-dependent 3alpha, 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. We have determined the crystal structures of a binary complex with NAD(+) and a ternary complex with androsterone and NADH. The structure reveals that Asp-38 determines the cofactor specificity. The catalytic site includes the triad Ser-140Tyr-153Lys-157. Additionally, it has an unusual feature, Glu-142. Enzymatic assays of the E142A mutant of Rv2002-M3 indicate that Glu-142 reverses the effect of Lys-157 in influencing the pKa of Tyr-153. This study suggests that the Rv2002 gene product is a unique member of the SDR family and is likely to be involved in steroid metabolism in M. tuberculosis. Our work demonstrates the power of the directed evolution technique as a general way of overcoming the difficulties in overexpressing the target proteins in soluble form.</p>

<p>In enzyme catalysis, where exquisitely positioned functionality is the sine qua non, atomic coordinates for a Michaelis complex can provide powerful insights into activation of the substrate. We focus here on the initial proton transfer of the isomerization reaction catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase and present the crystal structure of its Michaelis complex with the substrate dihydroxyacetone phosphate at near-atomic resolution. The active site is highly compact, with unusually short and bifurcated hydrogen bonds for both catalytic Glu-165 and His-95 residues. The carboxylate oxygen of the catalytic base Glu-165 is positioned in an unprecedented close interaction with the ketone and the alpha-hydroxy carbons of the substrate (C em leader O approximately 3.0 A), which is optimal for the proton transfer involving these centers. The electrophile that polarizes the substrate, His-95, has close contacts to the substrate's O1 and O2 (N em leader O &lt; or = 3.0 and 2.6 A, respectively). The substrate is conformationally relaxed in the Michaelis complex: the phosphate group is out of the plane of the ketone group, and the hydroxy and ketone oxygen atoms are not in the cisoid configuration. The epsilon ammonium group of the electrophilic Lys-12 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the substrate's ketone oxygen, the bridging oxygen, and a terminal phosphate's oxygen, suggesting a role for this residue in both catalysis and in controlling the flexibility of active-site loop.</p>

<p>A role for protein dynamics in enzymatic catalysis of hydrogen transfer has received substantial scientific support, but the connections between protein structure and catalysis remain to be established. Valine residues 203 and 207 are at the binding site for the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme in liver alcohol dehydrogenase and have been suggested to facilitate catalysis with "protein-promoting vibrations" (PPV). We find that the V207A substitution has small effects on steady-state kinetic constants and the rate of hydrogen transfer; the introduced cavity is empty and is tolerated with minimal effects on structure (determined at 1.2 Å for the complex with NAD(+) and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl alcohol). Thus, no evidence is found to support a role for Val-207 in the dynamics of catalysis. The protein structures and ligand geometries (including donor-acceptor distances) in the V203A enzyme complexed with NAD(+) and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl alcohol or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (determined at 1.1 Å) are very similar to those for the wild-type enzyme, except that the introduced cavity accommodates a new water molecule that contacts the nicotinamide ring. The structures of the V203A enzyme complexes suggest, in contrast to previous studies, that the diminished tunneling and decreased rate of hydride transfer (16-fold, relative to that of the wild-type enzyme) are not due to differences in ground-state ligand geometries. The V203A substitution may alter the PPV and the reorganization energy for hydrogen transfer, but the protein scaffold and equilibrium thermal motions within the Michaelis complex may be more significant for enzyme catalysis. </p>

<p>The structures of the noncovalent complex of human factor Xa (fXa) with four non-peptide inhibitors containing a central sulfonylpiperazinone scaffold have been determined to about 2.1 A resolution. Highly potent fXa inhibitors containing both neutral groups such as chlorobenzothiophene or chlorothiophene and basic groups such as benzamidine were shown to interact in the S1 pocket through the neutral group whereas the S4 pocket is occupied by the basic moiety. The scaffold comprising the sulfonyl keto piperazine moiety might play a pivotal role in the orientation of substituents, since there is a strong hydrogen bond between Gly219 of fXa and the carbonyl oxygen of the piperazine. This unique "reverse" binding mode is heretofore unreported in fXa and shows that electrostatic interactions in the S1 subsite are not an absolute requirement to maintain high affinity. Selectivity against other serine proteases can be readily explained in light of these structural results. It has opened up new prospects for designing fXa inhibitors with increased oral bioavailability.</p>

<p>Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 alpha-amylase 2 (TVAII) has the unique ability to hydrolyze cyclodextrins (CDs), with various sized cavities, as well as starch. To understand the relationship between structure and substrate specificity, x-ray structures of a TVAII-acarbose complex and inactive mutant TVAII (D325N/D421N)/alpha-, beta- and gamma-CDs complexes were determined at resolutions of 2.9, 2.9, 2.8, and 3.1 A, respectively. In all complexes, the interactions between ligands and enzymes at subsites -1, -2, and -3 were almost the same, but striking differences in the catalytic site structure were found at subsites +1 and +2, where Trp(356) and Tyr(374) changed the conformation of the side chain depending on the structure and size of the ligands. Trp(356) and Tyr(374) are thought to be responsible for the multiple substrate-recognition mechanism of TVAII, providing the unique substrate specificity. In the beta-CD complex, the beta-CD maintains a regular conical structure, making it difficult for Glu(354) to protonate the O-4 atom at the hydrolyzing site as a previously proposed hydrolyzing mechanism of alpha-amylase. From the x-ray structures, it is suggested that the protonation of the O-4 atom is possibly carried out via a hydrogen atom of the inter-glucose hydrogen bond at the hydrolyzing site.</p>

<p>Enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis are therapeutic targets for the treatment of important infectious diseases. Whereas this pathway is absent in humans, it is used by plants, many eubacteria and apicomplexan protozoa, including major human pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Herein, we report on the design, preparation and biological evaluation of a new series of ligands for IspE protein, a kinase from this pathway. These inhibitors were developed for the inhibition of IspE from Escherichia coli, using structure-based design approaches. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) and a co-crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus IspE bound to a representative inhibitor validate the proposed binding mode. The crystal structure shows that the ligand binds in the substrate-rather than the adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-binding pocket. As predicted, a cyclopropyl substituent occupies a small cavity not used by the substrate. The optimal volume occupancy of this cavity is explored in detail. In the co-crystal structure, a diphosphate anion binds to the Gly-rich loop, which normally accepts the triphosphate moiety of ATP. This structure provides useful insights for future structure-based developments of inhibitors for the parasite enzymes.</p>

<p>Plasmodium falciparum TIM (PfTIM) is unique in possessing a Phe residue at position 96 in place of the conserved Ser that is found in TIMs from the majority of other organisms. In order to probe the role of residue 96, three PfTIM mutants, F96S, F96H and F96W, have been biochemically and structurally characterized. The three mutants exhibited reduced catalytic efficiency and a decrease in substrate-binding affinity, with the most pronounced effects being observed for F96S and F96H. The k(cat) values and K(m) values are (2.54 +/- 0.19) x 10(5) min(-1) and 0.39 +/- 0.049 mM, respectively, for the wild type; (3.72 +/- 0.28) x 10(3) min(-1) and 2.18 +/- 0.028 mM, respectively, for the F96S mutant; (1.11 +/- 0.03) x 10(4) min(-1) and 2.62 +/- 0.042 mM, respectively, for the F96H mutant; and (1.48 +/- 0.05) x 10(5) min(-1) and 1.20 +/- 0.056 mM, respectively, for the F96W mutant. Unliganded and 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) complexed structures are reported for the wild-type enzyme and the mutants. The ligand binds to the active sites of the wild-type enzyme (wtPfTIM) and the F96W mutant, with a loop-open state in the former and both open and closed states in the latter. In contrast, no density for the ligand could be detected at the active sites of the F96S and F96H mutants under identical conditions. The decrease in ligand affinity could be a consequence of differences in the water network connecting residue 96 to Ser73 in the vicinity of the active site. Soaking of crystals of wtPfTIM and the F96S and F96H mutants resulted in the binding of 3PG at a dimer-interface site. In addition, loop closure at the liganded active site was observed for wtPfTIM. The dimer-interface site in PfTIM shows strong electrostatic anchoring of the phosphate group involving the Arg98 and Lys112 residues of PfTIM.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis is a major cause of death worldwide. Understanding of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been advanced by gene analysis and has led to the identification of genes that are important for intracellular survival in macrophages. One of these genes encodes HsaD, a meta-cleavage product (MCP) hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond in cholesterol metabolism. This paper describes the production of HsaD as a recombinant protein and, following crystallization, the determination of its three-dimensional structure to 2.35 A resolution by X-ray crystallography at the Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire, England. To the authors' knowledge, this study constitutes the first report of a structure determined at the new synchrotron facility. The volume of the active-site cleft of the HsaD enzyme is more than double the corresponding active-site volumes of related MCP hydrolases involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds, consistent with the specificity of HsaD for steroids such as cholesterol. Knowledge of the structure of the enzyme facilitates the design of inhibitors.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Cel44A, which is one of the enzymatic components of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum, was solved at a resolution of 0.96 A. This enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase family (GH family) 44. The structure reveals that Cel44A consists of a TIM-like barrel domain and a beta-sandwich domain. The wild-type and the E186Q mutant structures complexed with substrates suggest that two glutamic acid residues, Glu(186) and Glu(359), are the active residues of the enzyme. Biochemical experiments were performed to confirm this idea. The structural features indicate that GH family 44 belongs to clan GH-A and that the reaction catalyzed by Cel44A is retaining type hydrolysis. The stereochemical course of hydrolysis was confirmed by a (1)H NMR experiment using the reduced cellooligosaccharide as a substrate.</p>

<p>Several drugs and natural compounds are known to be highly neurotoxic, triggering epileptic convulsions or seizures, and causing headaches, agitations, as well as other neuronal symptoms. The neurotoxic effects of some of these compounds, including theophylline and ginkgotoxin, have been traced to their inhibitory activity against human pyridoxal kinase (hPL kinase), resulting in deficiency of the active cofactor form of vitamin B₆, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Pyridoxal (PL), an inactive form of vitamin B₆ is converted to PLP by PL kinase. PLP is the B₆ vitamer required as a cofactor for over 160 enzymatic activities essential in primary and secondary metabolism. We have performed structural and kinetic studies on hPL kinase with several potential inhibitors, including ginkgotoxin and theophylline. The structural studies show ginkgotoxin and theophylline bound at the substrate site, and are involved in similar protein interactions as the natural substrate, PL. Interestingly, the phosphorylated product of ginkgotoxin is also observed bound at the active site. This work provides insights into the molecular basis of hPL kinase inhibition and may provide a working hypothesis to quickly screen or identify neurotoxic drugs as potential hPL kinase inhibitors. Such adverse effects may be prevented by administration of an appropriate form of vitamin B₆, or provide clues of how to modify these drugs to help reduce their hPL kinase inhibitory effects.</p>

<p>The nonmevalonate route to isoprenoid biosynthesis is essential in Gram-negative bacteria and apicomplexan parasites. The enzymes of this pathway are absent from mammals, contributing to their appeal as chemotherapeutic targets. One enzyme, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF), has been validated as a target by genetic approaches in bacteria. Virtual screening against Escherichia coli IspF (EcIspF) was performed by combining a hierarchical filtering methodology with molecular docking. Docked compounds were inspected and 10 selected for experimental validation. A surface plasmon resonance assay was developed and two weak ligands identified. Crystal structures of EcIspF complexes were determined to support rational ligand development. Cytosine analogues and Zn(2+)-binding moieties were characterized. One of the putative Zn(2+)-binding compounds gave the lowest measured K(D) to date (1.92 +/- 0.18 muM). These data provide a framework for the development of IspF inhibitors to generate lead compounds of therapeutic potential against microbial pathogens.</p>

<p>Boronic acids have proved to be promising selective inhibitors of beta-lactamases, acting as transition state analogues. Starting from a previously described nanomolar inhibitor of AmpC beta-lactamase, three new inhibitors were designed to gain interactions with highly conserved residues, such as Asn343, and to bind more tightly to the enzyme. Among these, one was obtained by stereoselective synthesis and succeeded in placing its anionic group into the carboxylate binding site of the enzyme, as revealed by X-ray crystallography of the complex inhibitor/AmpC. Nevertheless, it failed at improving affinity, when compared to the lead from which it was derived. The origins of this structural and energetic discrepancy are discussed.</p>

<p>DOPA decarboxylase, the dimeric enzyme responsible for the synthesis of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, is involved in severe neurological diseases such as Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and depression. Binding of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor to the apoenzyme is thought to represent a central mechanism for the regulation of its activity. We solved the structure of the human apoenzyme and found it exists in an unexpected open conformation: compared to the pig kidney holoenzyme, the dimer subunits move 20 Å apart and the two active sites become solvent exposed. Moreover, by tuning the PLP concentration in the crystals, we obtained two more structures with different conformations of the active site. Analysis of three-dimensional data coupled to a kinetic study allows to identify the structural determinants of the open/close conformational change occurring upon PLP binding and thereby propose a model for the preferential degradation of the apoenzymes of Group II decarboxylases.</p>

<p>Copper-containing amine oxidases (CAOs) require a protein-derived topaquinone cofactor (TPQ) for activity. TPQ biogenesis is a self-processing reaction requiring the presence of copper and molecular oxygen. Recombinant human diamine oxidase (hDAO) was heterologously expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, and analysis indicates that the purified hDAO contains substoichiometric amounts of copper and TPQ. The crystal structure of a complex of an inhibitor, aminoguanidine, and hDAO at 2.05 Å resolution shows that the aminoguanidine forms a covalent adduct with the TPQ and that the site is ∼75% occupied. Aminoguanidine is a potent inhibitor of hDAO with an IC(50) of 153 ± 9 nM. The structure indicates that the catalytic metal site, normally occupied by copper, is fully occupied. X-ray diffraction data recorded below the copper edge, between the copper and zinc edges, and above the zinc edge have been used to show that the metal site is occupied approximately 75% by copper and 25% by zinc and the formation of the TPQ cofactor is correlated with copper occupancy.</p>

<p>Respiratory processes often use quinone oxidoreduction to generate a transmembrane proton gradient, making the 2H(+)/2e(-) quinone chemistry important for ATP synthesis. There are a variety of quinones used as electron carriers between bioenergetic proteins, and some respiratory proteins can functionally interact with more than one quinone type. In the case of complex II homologs, which couple quinone chemistry to the interconversion of succinate and fumarate, the redox potentials of the biologically available ubiquinone and menaquinone aid in driving the chemical reaction in one direction. In the complex II homolog quinol:fumarate reductase, it has been demonstrated that menaquinol oxidation requires at least one proton shuttle, but many of the remaining mechanistic details of menaquinol oxidation are not fully understood, and little is known about ubiquinone reduction. In the current study, structural and computational studies suggest that the sequential removal of the two menaquinol protons may be accompanied by a rotation of the naphthoquinone ring to optimize the interaction with a second proton shuttling pathway. However, kinetic measurements of site-specific mutations of quinol:fumarate reductase variants show that ubiquinone reduction does not use the same pathway. Computational docking of ubiquinone followed by mutagenesis instead suggested redundant proton shuttles lining the ubiquinone-binding site or from direct transfer from solvent. These data show that the quinone-binding site provides an environment that allows multiple amino acid residues to participate in quinone oxidoreduction. This suggests that the quinone-binding site in complex II is inherently plastic and can robustly interact with different types of quinones. </p>

<p>It is recognized widely that enzymes promote reactions by providing a pathway that proceeds through a transition state of lower energy. In principle, further rate enhancements could be achieved if intermediates are prevented from relaxing to their lowest energy state, and thereby reduce the barrier to the subsequent transition state. Here, we report sub-ångström-resolution crystal structures of genuine covalent reaction intermediates of transketolase. These structures reveal a pronounced out-of-plane distortion of over 20° for the covalent bond that links cofactor and substrate, and a specific elongation of the scissile substrate carbon-carbon bond (d &gt; 1.6 Å). To achieve these distortions, the protein's conformation appears to prevent relaxation of a substrate-cofactor intermediate. The results implicate a reduced barrier to the subsequent step that is consistent with an intermediate of raised energy and leads to a more efficient overall process. </p>

<p>Many carbohydrate-active enzymes have complex architectures comprising multiple modules that may be involved in catalysis, carbohydrate binding, or protein-protein interactions. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are a common ancillary module whose function is to promote the adherence of the complete enzyme to carbohydrate substrates. CBM family 32 has been proposed to be one of the most diverse CBM families classified to date, yet all of the structurally characterized CBM32s thus far recognize galactose-based ligands. Here, we report a unique binding specificity and mode of ligand binding for a family 32 CBM. NagHCBM32-2 is one of four CBM32 modules in NagH, a family 84 glycoside hydrolase secreted by Clostridium perfringens. NagHCBM32-2 has the beta-sandwich scaffold common to members of the family; however, its specificity for N-acetylglucosamine is unusual among CBMs. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the module at resolutions from 1.45 to 2.0 A and in complex with disaccharides reveals that its mode of sugar recognition is quite different from that observed for galactose-specific CBM32s. This study continues to unravel the diversity of CBMs found in family 32 and how these CBMs might impart the carbohydrate-binding specificity to the extracellular glycoside hydrolases in C. perfringens.</p>

<p>Cytokinins form a diverse class of compounds that are essential for plant growth. Cytokinin dehydrogenase has a major role in the control of the levels of these plant hormones by catalysing their irreversible oxidation. The crystal structure of Zea mays cytokinin dehydrogenase displays the same two-domain topology of the flavoenzymes of the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase family but its active site cannot be related to that of any other family member. The X-ray analysis reveals a bipartite architecture of the catalytic centre, which consists of a funnel-shaped region on the protein surface and an internal cavity lined by the flavin ring. A pore with diameter of about 4A connects the two active-site regions. Snapshots of two critical steps along the reaction cycle were obtained through the structural analysis of the complexes with a slowly reacting substrate and the reaction product, which correspond to the states immediately before (Michaelis complex) and after (product complex) oxidation has taken place. The substrate displays a "plug-into-socket" binding mode that seals the catalytic site and precisely positions the carbon atom undergoing oxidation in close contact with the reactive locus of the flavin. A polarising H-bond between the substrate amine group and an Asp-Glu pair may facilitate oxidation. Substrate to product conversion results in small atomic movements, which lead to a planar conformation of the reaction product allowing double-bond conjugation. These features in the mechanism of amine recognition and oxidation differ from those observed in other flavin-dependent amine oxidases.</p>

<p>Human UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like PHD and RING finger 1) functions to maintain CpG DNA methylation patterns through DNA replication by co-localizing with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 at chromatin in mammals. Recent studies show that UHRF1 binds selectively to hemimethylated CpG via its conserved SRA (SET- and RING finger-associated) domain. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not known. Here, we report a 1.95 A resolution crystal structure of the SRA domain of human UHRF1. Using NMR structure-guided mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and fluorescence anisotropy analysis, we determined key amino acid residues for methyl-DNA binding that are conserved in the SRA domain.</p>

<p>Metallo-beta-lactamases are zinc-dependent hydrolases that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering bacteria resistant to them. Asp-120 is fully conserved in all metallo-beta-lactamases and is central to catalysis. Several roles have been proposed for Asp-120, but so far there is no agreed consensus. We generated four site-specifically substituted variants of the enzyme BcII from Bacillus cereus as follows: D120N, D120E, D120Q, and D120S. Replacement of Asp-120 by other residues with very different metal ligating capabilities severely impairs the lactamase activity without abolishing metal binding to the mutated site. A kinetic study of these mutants indicates that Asp-120 is not the proton donor, nor does it play an essential role in nucleophilic activation. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analysis of D120S BcII, the least active mutant bearing the weakest metal ligand in the series, reveals that this enzyme is able to accommodate a dinuclear center and that perturbations in the active site are limited to the Zn2 site. It is proposed that the role of Asp-120 is to act as a strong Zn2 ligand, locating this ion optimally for substrate binding, stabilization of the development of a partial negative charge in the beta-lactam nitrogen, and protonation of this atom by a zinc-bound water molecule.</p>

<p>Human choline kinase (ChoK) catalyzes the first reaction in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and exists as ChoKalpha (alpha1 and alpha2) and ChoKbeta isoforms. Recent studies suggest that ChoK is implicated in tumorigenesis and emerging as an attractive target for anticancer chemotherapy. To extend our understanding of the molecular mechanism of ChoK inhibition, we have determined the high resolution x-ray structures of the ChoKalpha1 and ChoKbeta isoforms in complex with hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), a known inhibitor of ChoK. In both structures, HC-3 bound at the conserved hydrophobic groove on the C-terminal lobe. One of the HC-3 oxazinium rings complexed with ChoKalpha1 occupied the choline-binding pocket, providing a structural explanation for its inhibitory action. Interestingly, the HC-3 molecule co-crystallized with ChoKbeta was phosphorylated in the choline binding site. This phosphorylation, albeit occurring at a very slow rate, was confirmed experimentally by mass spectroscopy and radioactive assays. Detailed kinetic studies revealed that HC-3 is a much more potent inhibitor for ChoKalpha isoforms (alpha1 and alpha2) compared with ChoKbeta. Mutational studies based on the structures of both inhibitor-bound ChoK complexes demonstrated that Leu-401 of ChoKalpha2 (equivalent to Leu-419 of ChoKalpha1), or the corresponding residue Phe-352 of ChoKbeta, which is one of the hydrophobic residues neighboring the active site, influences the plasticity of the HC-3-binding groove, thereby playing a key role in HC-3 sensitivity and phosphorylation.</p>

<p>Kinetic, spectroscopic, and structural analysis tested the hypothesis that a chain of residues connecting the 4'-aminopyrimidine N1' atoms of thiamin diphosphates (ThDPs) in the two active centers of the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 component provides a signal transduction pathway. Substitution of the three acidic residues (Glu(571), Glu(235), and Glu(237)) and Arg(606) resulted in impaired binding of the second ThDP, once the first active center was filled, suggesting a pathway for communication between the two ThDPs. 1) Steady-state kinetic and fluorescence quenching studies revealed that upon E571A, E235A, E237A, and R606A substitutions, ThDP binding in the second active center was affected. 2) Analysis of the kinetics of thiazolium C2 hydrogen/deuterium exchange of enzyme-bound ThDP suggests half-of-the-sites reactivity for the E1 component, with fast (activated site) and slow exchanging sites (dormant site). The E235A and E571A variants gave no evidence for the slow exchanging site, indicating that only one of two active sites is filled with ThDP. 3) Titration of the E235A and E237A variants with methyl acetylphosphonate monitored by circular dichroism suggested that only half of the active sites were filled with a covalent predecarboxylation intermediate analog. 4) Crystal structures of E235A and E571A in complex with ThDP revealed the structural basis for the spectroscopic and kinetic observations and showed that either substitution affects cofactor binding, despite the fact that Glu(235) makes no direct contact with the cofactor. The role of the conserved Glu(571) residue in both catalysis and cofactor orientation is revealed by the combined results for the first time.</p>

<p>Neuroblastoma (NB), the most frequent extracranial solid tumor of children accounting for nearly 15% of all childhood cancer mortality, displays overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in aggressive forms of the disease. The clinical phase 2 drug roscovitine (CYC202, seliciclib), a relatively selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CR8, a recently developed and more potent analog, induce concentration-dependent apoptotic cell death of NB cells (average IC(50) values: 24.2 µM and 0.4 µM for roscovitine and CR8, respectively). Both roscovitine and CR8 trigger rapid down-regulation of the short-lived survival factor Mcl-1 in the 9 investigated human NB cell lines. This effect was further analyzed in the human SH-SY5Y NB cell line. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 appears to depend on inhibition of CDKs rather than on interaction of roscovitine and CR8 with their secondary targets. CR8 is an adenosine triphosphate-competitive inhibitor of CDK9, and the structure of a CDK9/cyclin T/CR8 complex is described. Mcl-1 down-regulation occurs both at the mRNA and protein levels. This effect can be accounted for by a reduction in Mcl-1 protein synthesis, under stable Mcl-1 degradation conditions. Mcl-1 down-regulation is accompanied by a transient increase in free Noxa, a proapoptotic factor. Mcl-1 down-regulation occurs independently of the presence or up-regulation of p53 and of the MYCN status. Taken together, these results suggest that the clinical drug roscovitine and its novel analog CR8 induce apoptotic tumor cell death by down-regulating Mcl-1, a key survival factor expressed in all NB cell lines. CDK inhibition may thus constitute a new approach to treat refractory high-risk NB.</p>

<p>Galactitol 2-dehydrogenase (GatDH) belongs to the protein superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases. As an enzyme capable of the stereo- and regioselective modification of carbohydrates, it exhibits a high potential for application in biotechnology as a biocatalyst. We have determined the crystal structure of the binary form of GatDH in complex with its cofactor NAD(H) and of the ternary form in complex with NAD(H) and three different substrates. The active form of GatDH constitutes a homo-tetramer with two magnesium-ion binding sites each formed by two opposing C termini. The catalytic tetrad is formed by Asn(116), Ser(144), Tyr(159), and Lys(163). GatDH structurally aligns well with related members of the short-chain dehydrogenase family. The substrate binding pocket can be divided into two parts of different size and polarity. In the smaller part, the side chains of amino acids Ser(144), Ser(146), and Asn(151) are important determinants for the binding specificity and the orientation of (pro-) chiral compounds. The larger part of the pocket is elongated and flanked by polar and non-polar residues, enabling a rather broad substrate spectrum. The presented structures provide valuable information for a rational design of this enzyme to improve its stability against pH, temperature, or solvent concentration and to optimize product yield in bioreactors.</p>

<p>We have used chemical protein synthesis and advanced physical methods to probe dynamics-function correlations for the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme that has received considerable attention as a target for the treatment of AIDS. Chemical synthesis was used to prepare a series of unique analogues of the HIV-1 protease in which the flexibility of the "flap" structures (residues 37-61 in each monomer of the homodimeric protein molecule) was systematically varied. These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations. We show that conformational isomerization in the flaps is correlated with structural reorganization of residues in the active site, and that it is preorganization of the active site that is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis.</p>

<p>The enzyme tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase (DapD) is part of the L-lysine biosynthetic pathway. This pathway is crucial for the survival of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and, consequently, the enzymes of the pathway are potential drug targets. We report here the crystal structures of Mtb-DapD and of Mtb-DapD in complex with the co-factor succinyl-CoA (SCoA) at 2.15 A and 1.97 A resolution, respectively. Each subunit of the trimeric enzyme consists of three domains, of which the second, a left-handed, parallel beta-helix (LbetaH domain), is the common structural motif of enzymes belonging to the hexapeptide repeat superfamily. The trimeric quaternary structure is stabilized by Mg(2+) and Na(+) located on the 3-fold axis. The binary complex of Mtb-DapD and SCoA reveals the binding mode(s) of the co-factor and a possible covalent reaction intermediate. The N-terminal domain of Mtb-DapD exhibits a unique architecture, including an interior water-filled channel, which allows access to a magnesium ion located at the 3-fold symmetry axis.</p>

<p>The flavoprotein methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli catalyzes the reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH(2)-H(4)folate) by NADH via a ping-pong reaction mechanism. Structures of the reduced enzyme in complex with NADH and of the oxidized Glu28Gln enzyme in complex with CH(3)-H(4)folate [Pejchal, R., Sargeant, R., and Ludwig, M. L. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 11447-11457] have revealed Phe223 as a conformationally mobile active site residue. In the NADH complex, the NADH adopts an unusual hairpin conformation and is wedged between the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD and the side chain of Phe223. In the folate complex, Phe223 swings out from its position in the NADH complex to stack against the p-aminobenzoate ring of the folate. Although Phe223 contacts each substrate in E. coli MTHFR, this residue is not invariant; for example, a leucine occurs at this site in the human enzyme. To examine the role of Phe223 in substrate binding and catalysis, we have constructed mutants Phe223Ala and Phe223Leu. As predicted, our results indicate that Phe223 participates in the binding of both substrates. The Phe223Ala mutation impairs NADH and CH(2)-H(4)folate binding each 40-fold yet slows catalysis of both half-reactions less than 2-fold. Affinity for CH(2)-H(4)folate is unaffected by the Phe223Leu mutation, and the variant catalyzes the oxidative half-reaction 3-fold faster than the wild-type enzyme. Structures of ligand-free Phe223Leu and Phe223Leu/Glu28Gln MTHFR in complex with CH(3)-H(4)folate have been determined at 1.65 and 1.70 A resolution, respectively. The structures show that the folate is bound in a catalytically competent conformation, and Leu223 undergoes a conformational change similar to that observed for Phe223 in the Glu28Gln-CH(3)-H(4)folate structure. Taken together, our results suggest that Leu may be a suitable replacement for Phe223 in the oxidative half-reaction of E. coli MTHFR.</p>

<p>Vertebrate vision is maintained by the retinoid (visual) cycle, a complex enzymatic pathway that operates in the retina to regenerate the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal. A key enzyme in this pathway is the microsomal membrane protein RPE65. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of all-trans-retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinol in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Mutations in RPE65 are known to be responsible for a subset of cases of the most common form of childhood blindness, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Although retinoid isomerase activity has been attributed to RPE65, its catalytic mechanism remains a matter of debate. Also, the manner in which RPE65 binds to membranes and extracts retinoid substrates is unclear. To gain insight into these questions, we determined the crystal structure of native bovine RPE65 at 2.14-A resolution. The structural, biophysical, and biochemical data presented here provide the framework needed for an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of catalytic isomerization and membrane association, in addition to the role mutations that cause LCA have in disrupting protein function.</p>

<p>The mechanism of action of AFN-1252, a selective inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI), which is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, was confirmed by using biochemistry, macromolecular synthesis, genetics, and cocrystallization of an AFN-1252-FabI complex. AFN-1252 demonstrated a low propensity for spontaneous resistance development and a time-dependent reduction of the viability of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, achieving a ≥2-log(10) reduction in S. aureus counts over 24 h, and was extremely potent against clinical isolates of S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.015 μg/ml) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(90), 0.12 μg/ml), regardless of their drug resistance, hospital- or community-associated origin, or other clinical subgroup. AFN-1252 was orally available in mouse pharmacokinetic studies, and a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg AFN-1252 was efficacious in a mouse model of septicemia, providing 100% protection from an otherwise lethal peritoneal infection of S. aureus Smith. A median effective dose of 0.15 mg/kg indicated that AFN-1252 was 12 to 24 times more potent than linezolid in the model. These studies, demonstrating a selective mode of action, potent in vitro activity, and in vivo efficacy, support the continued investigation of AFN-1252 as a targeted therapeutic for staphylococcal infections.</p>

<p>Arabinanases are glycosidases that hydrolyse alpha-(1--&gt;5)- arabinofuranosidic linkages found in the backbone of the pectic polysaccharide arabinan. Here we describe the biochemical characterization and the enzyme-substrate crystal structure of an inverting family 43 arabinanase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 (AbnB). Based on viscosity and reducing power measurements, and based on product analysis for the hydrolysis of linear arabinan by AbnB, the enzyme works in an endo mode of action. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies of a catalytic mutant with various arabino-oligosaccharides suggested that the enzyme active site can accommodate at least five arabinose units. The crystal structure of AbnB was determined at 1.06 A (1 A=0.1 nm) resolution, revealing a single five-bladed-beta-propeller fold domain. Co-crystallization of catalytic mutants of the enzyme with different substrates allowed us to obtain complex structures of AbnBE201A with arabinotriose and AbnBD147A with arabinobiose. Based on the crystal structures of AbnB together with its substrates, the position of the three catalytic carboxylates: Asp27, the general base; Glu201, the general acid; and Asp147, the pKa modulator, is in agreement with their putative catalytic roles. In the complex structure of AbnBE201A with arabinotriose, a single water molecule is located 2.8 A from Asp27 and 3.7 A from the anomeric carbon. The position of this water molecule is kept via hydrogen bonding with a conserved tyrosine (Tyr229) that is 2.6 A distant from it. The location of this molecule suggests that it can function as the catalytic water molecule in the hydrolysis reaction, resulting in the inversion of the anomeric configuration of the product.</p>

<p>Plant beta-glucosidases play a crucial role in defense against pests. They cleave, with variable specificity, beta-glucosides to release toxic aglycone moieties. The Sorghum bicolor beta-glucosidase isoenzyme Dhr1 has a strict specificity for its natural substrate dhurrin (p-hydroxy-(S)-mandelonitrile-beta-D-glucoside), whereas its close homolog, the maize beta-glucosidase isoenzyme Glu1, which shares 72% sequence identity, hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of substrates in addition to its natural substrate 2-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxaxin-3-one. Structural data from enzyme.substrate complexes of Dhr1 show that the mode of aglycone binding differs from that previously observed in the homologous maize enzyme. Specifically, the data suggest that Asn(259), Phe(261), and Ser(462), located in the aglycone-binding site of S. bicolor Dhr1, are crucial for aglycone recognition and binding. The tight binding of the aglycone moiety of dhurrin promotes the stabilization of the reaction intermediate in which the glycone moiety is in a deformed (1)S(3) conformation within the glycone-binding site, ready for nucleophilic attack to occur. Compared with the broad specificity maize beta-glucosidase, this different binding mode explains the narrow specificity of sorghum dhurrinase-1.</p>

<p>The atomic resolution structures of xylobiose-derived isofagomine and xylobiose-derived deoxynojirimycin in complex with the xylanase Xyn10A from Streptomyces lividans reveal undistorted (4)C(1) chair conformed sugars and, in the case of the deoxynojirimycin analogue, suggest unusual pK(a) changes of the enzyme's catalytic machinery upon binding.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the dimeric O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase isozyme B from Escherichia coli (CysM), complexed with the substrate analog citrate, has been determined at 1.33 A resolution by X-ray diffraction analysis. The C1-carboxylate of citrate was bound at the carboxylate position of O-acetylserine, whereas the C6-carboxylate adopted two conformations. The activity of the enzyme and of several active center mutants was determined using an assay based on O-acetylserine and thio-nitrobenzoate (TNB). The unnatural substrate TNB was modeled into the reported structure. The substrate model and the observed mutant activities may facilitate future protein engineering attempts designed to broaden the substrate spectrum of the enzyme. A comparison of the reported structure with previously published CysM structures revealed large conformational changes. One of the crystal forms contained two dimers, each of which comprised one subunit in a closed and one in an open conformation. Although the homodimer asymmetry was most probably caused by crystal packing, it indicates that the enzyme can adopt such a state in solution, which may be relevant for the catalytic reaction.</p>

<p>Deacetoxycephalosporin-C synthase (DAOCS) is a mononuclear ferrous enzyme that transforms penicillins into cephalosporins by inserting a carbon atom into the penicillin nucleus. In the first half-reaction, dioxygen and 2-oxoglutarate produce a reactive iron-oxygen species, succinate and CO2. The oxidizing iron species subsequently reacts with penicillin to give cephalosporin and water. Here we describe high-resolution structures for ferrous DAOCS in complex with penicillins, the cephalosporin product, the cosubstrate and the coproduct. Steady-state kinetic data, quantum-chemical calculations and the new structures indicate a reaction sequence in which a 'booby-trapped' oxidizing species is formed. This species is stabilized by the negative charge of succinate on the iron. The binding sites of succinate and penicillin overlap, and when penicillin replaces succinate, it removes the stabilizing charge, eliciting oxidative attack on itself. Requisite groups of penicillin are within 1 A of the expected position of a ferryl oxygen in the enzyme-penicillin complex.</p>

<p>Prokaryotic phosphopentomutases (PPMs) are di-Mn(2+) enzymes that catalyze the interconversion of α-D-ribose 5-phosphate and α-D-ribose 1-phosphate at an active site located between two independently folded domains. These prokaryotic PPMs belong to the alkaline phosphatase superfamily, but previous studies of Bacillus cereus PPM suggested adaptations of the conserved alkaline phosphatase catalytic cycle. Notably, B. cereus PPM engages substrates when the active site nucleophile, Thr-85, is phosphorylated. Further, the phosphoenzyme is stable throughout purification and crystallization. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase engages substrates when the active site nucleophile is dephosphorylated, and the phosphoenzyme reaction intermediate is only stably trapped in a catalytically compromised enzyme. Studies were undertaken to understand the divergence of these mechanisms. Crystallographic and biochemical investigations of the PPM(T85E) phosphomimetic variant and the neutral corollary PPM(T85Q) determined that the side chain of Lys-240 underwent a change in conformation in response to active site charge, which modestly influenced the affinity for the small molecule activator α-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. More strikingly, the structure of unphosphorylated B. cereus PPM revealed a dramatic change in the interdomain angle and a new hydrogen bonding interaction between the side chain of Asp-156 and the active site nucleophile, Thr-85. This hydrogen bonding interaction is predicted to align and activate Thr-85 for nucleophilic addition to α-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, favoring the observed equilibrium phosphorylated state. Indeed, phosphorylation of Thr-85 is severely impaired in the PPM(D156A) variant even under stringent activation conditions. These results permit a proposal for activation of PPM and explain some of the essential features that distinguish between the catalytic cycles of PPM and alkaline phosphatase.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the vitamin B(6)-dependent enzyme phosphoserine aminotransferase from the obligatory alkaliphile Bacillus alcalophilus has been determined at 1.08 A resolution. The model was refined to an R-factor of 11.7% (R(free) = 13.9%). The enzyme displays a narrow pH optimum of enzymatic activity at pH 9.0. The final structure was compared to the previously reported structure of the mesophilic phosphoserine aminotransferase from Escherichia coli and to that of phosphoserine aminotransferase from a facultative alkaliphile, Bacillus circulans subsp. alkalophilus. All three enzymes are homodimers with each monomer comprising a two-domain architecture. Despite the high structural similarity, the alkaliphilic representatives possess a set of distinctive structural features. Two residues directly interacting with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate are replaced, and an additional hydrogen bond to the O3' atom of the cofactor is present in alkaliphilic phosphoserine aminotransferases. The number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface is increased. Hydrophobic interactions between the two domains in the monomers are enhanced. Moreover, the number of negatively charged amino acid residues increases on the solvent-accessible molecular surface and fewer hydrophobic residues are exposed to the solvent. Further, the total amount of ion pairs and ion networks is significantly reduced in the Bacillus enzymes, while the total number of hydrogen bonds is increased. The mesophilic enzyme from Escherichia coli contains two additional beta-strands in a surface loop with a third beta-strand being shorter in the structure. The identified structural features are proposed to be possible factors implicated in the alkaline adaptation of phosphoserine aminotransferase.</p>

<p>Mammalian cells produce a variety of inositol phosphates (InsPs), including Ins(1,4,5)P3 that serves both as a second messenger and as a substrate for inositol polyphosphate kinases (IPKs), which further phosphorylate it. We report the structure of an IPK, the human Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase-A, both free and in complexes with substrates and products. This enzyme catalyzes transfer of a phosphate from ATP to the 3-OH of Ins(1,4,5)P3, and its X-ray crystal structure provides a template for understanding a broad family of InsP kinases. The catalytic domain consists of three lobes. The N and C lobes bind ATP and resemble protein and lipid kinases, despite insignificant sequence similarity. The third lobe binds inositol phosphate and is a unique four-helix insertion in the C lobe. This lobe embraces all of the phosphates of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in a positively charged pocket, explaining the enzyme's substrate specificity and its inability to phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2, the membrane-resident analog of Ins(1,4,5)P3.</p>

<p>As part of an ongoing enzyme discovery program to investigate the properties and catalytic mechanism of glycoside hydrolase family 12 (GH 12) endoglucanases, a GH family that contains several cellulases that are of interest in industrial applications, we have solved four new crystal structures of wild-type Humicola grisea Cel12A in complexes formed by soaking with cellobiose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and a thio-linked cellotetraose derivative (G2SG2). These complex structures allow mapping of the non-covalent interactions between the enzyme and the glucosyl chain bound in subsites -4 to +2 of the enzyme, and shed light on the mechanism and function of GH 12 cellulases. The unhydrolysed cellopentaose and the G2SG2 cello-oligomers span the active site of the catalytically active H.grisea Cel12A enzyme, with the pyranoside bound in subsite -1 displaying a S31 skew boat conformation. After soaking in cellotetraose, the cello-oligomer that is found bound in site -4 to -1 contains a beta-1,3-linkage between the two cellobiose units in the oligomer, which is believed to have been formed by a transglycosylation reaction that has occurred during the ligand soak of the protein crystals. The close fit of this ligand and the binding sites occupied suggest a novel mixed beta-glucanase activity for this enzyme.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the primary cause of mortality among infectious diseases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis thymidylate kinase (TMPK(Mtub)) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate (dTMP). Essential to DNA replication, this enzyme represents a promising target for developing new drugs against TB, because the configuration of its active site is unique within the TMPK family. Indeed, it has been proposed that, as opposed to other TMPKs, catalysis by TMPK(Mtub) necessitates the transient binding of a magnesium ion coordinating the phosphate acceptor. Moreover, 3'-azidodeoxythymidine monophosphate (AZTMP) is a competitive inhibitor of TMPK(Mtub), whereas it is a substrate for human and other TMPKs. Here, the crystal structures of TMPK(Mtub) in complex with deoxythymidine (dT) and AZTMP were determined to 2.1 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively, and suggest a mechanism for inhibition. The azido group of AZTMP perturbs the induced-fit mechanism normally adopted by the enzyme. Magnesium is prevented from binding, and the resulting electrostatic environment precludes phosphoryl transfer from occurring. Our data provide a model for drug development against tuberculosis.</p>

<p>We examined the catalytic cycle of transaldolase (TAL) from Thermoplasma acidophilum by cryocrystallography and were able to structurally characterize--for the first time, to our knowledge--different genuine TAL reaction intermediates. These include the Schiff base adducts formed between the catalytic lysine and the donor ketose substrates fructose-6-phosphate and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate as well as the Michaelis complex with acceptor aldose erythrose-4-phosphate. These structural snapshots necessitate a revision of the accepted reaction mechanism with respect to functional roles of active site residues, and they further reveal fundamental insights into the general structural features of enzymatic Schiff base intermediates and the role of conformational dynamics in enzyme catalysis, substrate binding and discrimination. A nonplanar arrangement of the substituents around the Schiff base double bond was observed, suggesting that a structurally encoded reactant-state destabilization is a driving force of catalysis. Protein dynamics and the intrinsic hydrogen-bonding pattern appear to be crucial for selective recognition and binding of ketose as first substrate.</p>

<p>Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is an enzyme of glycolysis that interconverts glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) but, outside the cell, is a multifunctional cytokine. High-resolution crystal structures of the enzyme from mouse have been determined in native form and in complex with the inhibitor erythrose 4-phosphate, and with the substrate glucose 6-phosphate. In the substrate-bound structure, the glucose sugar is observed in both straight-chain and ring forms. This structure supports a specific role for Lys518 in enzyme-catalyzed ring opening and we present a "push-pull" mechanism in which His388 breaks the O5-C1 bond by donating a proton to the ring oxygen atom and, simultaneously, Lys518 abstracts a proton from the C1 hydroxyl group. The reverse occurs in ring closure. The transition from ring form to straight-chain substrate is achieved through rotation of the C3-C4 bond, which brings the C1-C2 region into close proximity to Glu357, the base catalyst for the isomerization step. The structure with G6P also explains the specificity of PGI for glucose 6-phosphate over mannose 6-isomerase (M6P). To isomerize M6P to F6P requires a rotation of its C2-C3 bond but in PGI this is sterically blocked by Gln511.</p>

<p>A gene homologous to D-ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.6) was found in the genome of Pyrococcus horikoshii. D-ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (PRI) is of particular metabolic importance since it catalyzes the interconversion between the ribose and ribulose forms involved in the pentose phosphate cycle and in the process of photosynthesis. The gene consisting of 687 bp was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting enzyme showed activity at high temperatures with an optimum over 90 degrees C. The crystal structures of the enzyme, free and in complex with D-4-phosphoerythronic acid inhibitor, were determined. PRI is a tetramer in the crystal and in solution, and each monomer has a new fold consisting of two alpha/beta domains. The 3D structures and the characterization of different mutants indicate a direct or indirect catalytic role for the residues E107, D85, and K98.</p>

<p>A family of dinuclear iron cluster-containing oxygenases that catalyze β-hydroxylation tailoring reactions in natural product biosynthesis by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) systems was recently described [Makris, T. M., Chakrabarti, M., Münck, E., and Lipscomb, J. D. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 15391-15396]. Here, the 2.17 Å X-ray crystal structure of the archetypal enzyme from the family, CmlA, is reported. CmlA catalyzes β-hydroxylation of l-p-aminophenylalanine during chloramphenicol biosynthesis. The fold of the N-terminal domain of CmlA is unlike any previously reported, but the C-terminal domain has the αββα fold of the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) superfamily. The diiron cluster bound in the C-terminal domain is coordinated by an acetate, three His residues, two Asp residues, one Glu residue, and a bridging oxo moiety. One of the Asp ligands forms an unusual monodentate bridge. No other oxygen-activating diiron enzyme utilizes this ligation or the MBL protein fold. The N-terminal domain facilitates dimerization, but using computational docking and a sequence-based structural comparison to homologues, we hypothesize that it likely serves additional roles in NRPS recognition and the regulation of O2 activation.</p>

<p>Nerve agents are chiral organophosphate compounds (OPs) that exert their acute toxicity by phosphorylating the catalytic serine of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The inhibited cholinesterases can be reactivated using oximes, but a spontaneous time-dependent process called aging alters the adduct, leading to resistance toward oxime reactivation. Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) functions as a bioscavenger, protecting the cholinergic system against OPs. The stereoselectivity of BChE is an important parameter for its efficiency at scavenging the most toxic OPs enantiomer for AChE. Crystals of BChE inhibited in solution or in cristallo with racemic V-agents (VX, Russian VX, and Chinese VX) systematically show the formation of the P(S) adduct. In this configuration, no catalysis of aging seems possible as confirmed by the three-dimensional structures of the three conjugates incubated over a period exceeding a week. Crystals of BChE soaked in optically pure VX(R)-(+) and VX(S)-(-) solutions lead to the formation of the P(S) and P(R) adduct, respectively. These structural data support an in-line phosphonylation mechanism. Additionally, they show that BChE reacts with VX(R)-(+) in the presence of racemic mixture of V-agents, at odds with earlier kinetic results showing a moderate higher inhibition rate for VX(S)-(-). These combined results suggest that the simultaneous presence of both enantiomers alters the enzyme stereoselectivity. In summary, the three-dimensional data show that BChE reacts preferentially with P(R) enantiomer of V-agents and does not age, in complete contrast to AChE, which is selectively inhibited by the P(S) enantiomer and ages.</p>

<p>The requirement for d-alanine in the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls is fulfilled in part by alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-assisted enzyme. The enzyme utilizes two antiparallel bases focused at the C(alpha) position and oriented perpendicular to the PLP ring to facilitate the equilibration of alanine enantiomers. Understanding how this two-base system is utilized and controlled to yield reaction specificity is therefore a potential means for designing antibiotics. Cycloserine is a known alanine racemase suicide substrate, although its mechanism of inactivation is based on transaminase chemistry. Here we characterize the effects of a Y265F mutant (Tyr265 acts as the catalytic base in the l-isomer case) of Bacillus stearothermophilus alanine racemase on cycloserine inactivation. The Y265F mutant reduces racemization activity 1600-fold [Watanabe, A., Yoshimura, T., Mikami, B., and Esaki, N. (1999) J. Biochem. 126, 781-786] and only leads to formation of the isoxazole end product (the result of the transaminase pathway) in the case of d-cycloserine, in contrast to results obtained using the wild-type enzyme. l-Cycloserine, on the other hand, utilizes a number of alternative pathways in the absence of Y265, emphasizing the importance of Y265 in both the inactivation and racemization pathway. In combination with the kinetics of inactivation, these results suggest roles for each of the two catalytic bases in racemization and inactivation, as well as the importance of Y265 in "steering" the chemistry to favor one pathway over another.</p>

<p>Chitinase B (ChiB) from Serratia marcescens is a family 18 exo-chitinase whose catalytic domain has a TIM-barrel fold with a tunnel-shaped active site. We have solved structures of three ChiB complexes that reveal details of substrate binding, substrate-assisted catalysis, and product displacement. The structure of an inactive ChiB mutant (E144Q) complexed with a pentameric substrate (binding in subsites -2 to +3) shows closure of the "roof" of the active site tunnel. It also shows that the sugar in the -1 position is distorted to a boat conformation, thus providing structural evidence in support of a previously proposed catalytic mechanism. The structures of the active enzyme complexed to allosamidin (an analogue of a proposed reaction intermediate) and of the active enzyme soaked with pentameric substrate show events after cleavage of the glycosidic bond. The latter structure shows reopening of the roof of the active site tunnel and enzyme-assisted product displacement in the +1 and +2 sites, allowing a water molecule to approach the reaction center. Catalysis is accompanied by correlated structural changes in the core of the TIM barrel that involve conserved polar residues whose functions were hitherto unknown. These changes simultaneously contribute to stabilization of the reaction intermediate and alternation of the pKa of the catalytic acid during the catalytic cycle.</p>

<p>Arginase is a binuclear manganese metalloenzyme that serves as a therapeutic target for the treatment of asthma, erectile dysfunction, and atherosclerosis. In order to better understand the molecular basis of inhibitor affinity, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, and X-ray crystallography to probe the molecular recognition of the amino acid moiety (i.e., the alpha-amino and alpha-carboxylate groups) of substrate l-arginine and inhibitors in the active site of arginase I. Specifically, we focus on (1) a water-mediated hydrogen bond between the substrate alpha-carboxylate and T135, (2) a direct hydrogen bond between the substrate alpha-carboxylate and N130, and (3) a direct charged hydrogen bond between the substrate alpha-amino group and D183. Amino acid substitutions for T135, N130, and D183 generally compromise substrate affinity as reflected by increased K(M) values but have less pronounced effects on catalytic function as reflected by minimal variations of k(cat). As with substrate K(M) values, inhibitor K(d) values increase for binding to enzyme mutants and suggest that the relative contribution of intermolecular interactions to amino acid affinity in the arginase active site is water-mediated hydrogen bond &lt; direct hydrogen bond &lt; direct charged hydrogen bond. Structural comparisons of arginase with the related binuclear manganese metalloenzymes agmatinase and proclavaminic acid amidinohydrolase suggest that the evolution of substrate recognition in the arginase fold occurs by mutation of residues contained in specificity loops flanking the mouth of the active site (especially loops 4 and 5), thereby allowing diverse guanidinium substrates to be accommodated for catalysis.</p>

<p>The wealth of kinetic and structural information makes inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPases) a good model system to study the details of enzymatic phosphoryl transfer. The enzyme accelerates metal-complexed phosphoryl transfer 10(10)-fold: but how? Our structures of the yeast PPase product complex at 1.15 A and fluoride-inhibited complex at 1.9 A visualize the active site in three different states: substrate-bound, immediate product bound, and relaxed product bound. These span the steps around chemical catalysis and provide strong evidence that a water molecule (O(nu)) directly attacks PPi with a pK(a) vastly lowered by coordination to two metal ions and D117. They also suggest that a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) forms between D117 and O(nu), in part because of steric crowding by W100 and N116. Direct visualization of the double bonds on the phosphates appears possible. The flexible side chains at the top of the active site absorb the motion involved in the reaction, which may help accelerate catalysis. Relaxation of the product allows a new nucleophile to be generated and creates symmetry in the elementary catalytic steps on the enzyme. We are thus moving closer to understanding phosphoryl transfer in PPases at the quantum mechanical level. Ultra-high resolution structures can thus tease out overlapping complexes and so are as relevant to discussion of enzyme mechanism as structures produced by time-resolved crystallography.</p>

<p>The Escherichia coli protein WrbA, an FMN-dependent NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, was crystallized under new conditions in the presence of FAD or the native cofactor FMN. Slow-growing deep yellow crystals formed with FAD display the tetragonal bipyramidal shape typical for WrbA and diffract to 1.2 Å resolution, the highest yet reported. Faster-growing deep yellow crystals formed with FMN display an atypical shape, but diffract to only ∼1.6 Å resolution and are not analysed further here. The 1.2 Å resolution structure detailed here revealed only FMN in the active site and no electron density that can accommodate the missing parts of FAD. The very high resolution supports the modelling of the FMN isoalloxazine with a small but distinct propeller twist, apparently the first experimental observation of this predicted conformation, which appears to be enforced by the protein through a network of hydrogen bonds. Comparison of the electron density of the twisted isoalloxazine ring with the results of QM/MM simulations is compatible with the oxidized redox state. The very high resolution also supports the unique refinement of Met10 as the sulfoxide, confirmed by mass spectrometry. Bond lengths, intramolecular distances, and the pattern of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors suggest the cofactor may interact with Met10. Slow incorporation of FMN, which is present as a trace contaminant in stocks of FAD, into growing crystals may be responsible for the near-atomic resolution, but a direct effect of the conformation of FMN and/or Met10 sulfoxide cannot be ruled out. </p>

<p>A congeneric series of benzamidine-type ligands with a central proline moiety and a terminal cycloalkyl group--linked by a secondary amine, ether, or methylene bridge--was synthesized as trypsin inhibitors. This series of inhibitors was investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry, crystal structure analysis in two crystal forms, and molecular dynamics simulations. Even though all of these congeneric ligands exhibited essentially the same affinity for trypsin, their binding profiles at the structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic levels are very distinct. The ligands display a pronounced enthalpy/entropy compensation that results in a nearly unchanged free energy of binding, even though individual enthalpy and entropy terms change significantly across the series. Crystal structures revealed that the secondary amine-linked analogs scatter over two distinct conformational families of binding modes that occupy either the inside or of the outside the protein's S3/S4 specificity pocket. In contrast, the ether-linked and methylene-linked ligands preferentially occupy the hydrophobic specificity pocket. This also explains why the latter ligands could only be crystallized in the conformationally restricting closed crystal form whereas the derivative with the highest residual mobility in the series escaped our attempts to crystallize it in the closed form; instead, a well-resolved structure could only be achieved in the open form with the ligand in disordered orientation. These distinct binding modes are supported by molecular dynamics simulations and correlate with the shifting enthalpic/entropic signatures of ligand binding. The examples demonstrate that, at the molecular level, binding modes and thermodynamic binding signatures can be very different even for closely related ligands. However, deviating binding profiles provide the opportunity to optimally address a given target.</p>

<p>Darunavir and tipranavir are two inhibitors that are active against multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 protease variants. In this study, the invitro inhibitory efficacy was tested against a MDR HIV-1 protease variant, MDR 769 82T, containing the drug resistance mutations of 46L/54V/82T/84V/90M. Crystallographic and enzymatic studies were performed to examine the mechanism of resistance and the relative maintenance of potency. The key findings are as follows: (i) The MDR protease exhibits decreased susceptibility to all nine HIV-1 protease inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), among which darunavir and tipranavir are the most potent; (ii) the threonine 82 mutation on the protease greatly enhances drug resistance by altering the hydrophobicity of the binding pocket; (iii) darunavir or tipranavir binding facilitates closure of the wide-open flaps of the MDR protease; and (iv) the remaining potency of tipranavir may be preserved by stabilizing the flaps in the inhibitor-protease complex while darunavir maintains its potency by preserving protein main chain hydrogen bonds with the flexible P2 group. These results could provide new insights into drug design strategies to overcome multi-drug resistance of HIV-1 protease variants.</p>

<p>Fragment-based ligand and drug discovery predominantly employs sp(2)-rich compounds covering well-explored regions of chemical space. Despite the ease with which such fragments can be coupled, this focus on flat compounds is widely cited as contributing to the attrition rate of the drug discovery process. In contrast, biologically validated natural products are rich in stereogenic centres and populate areas of chemical space not occupied by average synthetic molecules. Here, we have analysed more than 180,000 natural product structures to arrive at 2,000 clusters of natural-product-derived fragments with high structural diversity, which resemble natural scaffolds and are rich in sp(3)-configured centres. The structures of the cluster centres differ from previously explored fragment libraries, but for nearly half of the clusters representative members are commercially available. We validate their usefulness for the discovery of novel ligand and inhibitor types by means of protein X-ray crystallography and the identification of novel stabilizers of inactive conformations of p38α MAP kinase and of inhibitors of several phosphatases.</p>

<p>Temperature sensing is essential for the survival of living cells. A major challenge is to understand how a biological thermometer processes thermal information to optimize cellular functions. Using structural and biochemical approaches, we show that the thermosensitive histidine kinase, DesK, from Bacillus subtilis is cold-activated through specific interhelical rearrangements in its central four-helix bundle domain. As revealed by the crystal structures of DesK in different functional states, the plasticity of this helical domain influences the catalytic activities of the protein, either by modifying the mobility of the ATP-binding domains for autokinase activity or by modulating binding of the cognate response regulator to sustain the phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities. The structural and biochemical data suggest a model in which the transmembrane sensor domain of DesK promotes these structural changes through conformational signals transmitted by the membrane-connecting two-helical coiled-coil, ultimately controlling the alternation between output autokinase and phosphatase activities. The structural comparison of the different DesK variants indicates that incoming signals can take the form of helix rotations and asymmetric helical bends similar to those reported for other sensing systems, suggesting that a similar switching mechanism could be operational in a wide range of sensor histidine kinases.</p>

<p>Flavonoids are known for their beneficial effects on human health, and therefore the therapeutic potential of these compounds have been extensively studied. Flavone has been previously identified as a tankyrase inhibitor, and to further elucidate whether tankyrases would be inhibited by other flavonoids, we performed a systematic screening of tankyrase 2 inhibitory activity using 500 natural and naturally derived flavonoids covering nine different flavonoid classes. All identified tankyrase inhibitors were flavones. We report crystal structures of all the hit compounds in complex with the catalytic domain of human tankyrase 2. Flavone derivatives in all 10 crystal structures bind to the nicotinamide binding site of tankyrase 2. Potencies of the active flavones toward tankyrases vary between 50 nM and 1.1 μM, and flavones show up to 200-fold selectivity for tankyrases over ARTD1. The molecular details of the interactions revealed by cocrystal structures efficiently describe the properties of potent flavone derivatives inhibiting tankyrases.</p>

<p>The activation of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) with L-adrenaline and histamine has been investigated by kinetic and X-ray crystallographic studies. L-Adrenaline behaves as a potent activator of isozyme CA I (activation constant of 90 nM), being a much weaker activator of isozyme CA II (activation constant of 96 microM). Isoforms CA IV, VA, VII, and XIV were activated by L-adrenaline with K(A)s in the range of 36-63 microM. The X-ray crystal structure of the CA II-L-adrenaline adduct revealed that the activator plugs the entrance of the active site cavity, obstructing it almost completely.</p>

<p>In this paper, we present a new class of carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor that was designed to selectively target the extracellular domains of the cancer-relevant CA isozymes. The aromatic moiety of the classical zinc binding sulfonamide CA inhibitors is absent from these compounds and instead they incorporate a hydrophilic mono- or disaccharide fragment directly attached to the sulfonamide group to give S-glycosyl primary sulfonamides (1-10). The inhibition properties of these compounds at the physiologically abundant human CA isozymes I and II and cancer-associated IX and XII were determined, and all compounds had moderate potency with K(i)s in the micromolar range. We present the crystal structures of anomeric sulfonamides 4, 7, and 10 and the sugar sulfamate drug topiramate in complex with human recombinant CA II. From these structures, we have obtained valuable insights into ligand-protein interactions of these novel carbohydrate-based sulfonamides with CA.</p>

<p>Orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase) is an interesting enzyme with an unusual catalytic activity and a potential drug target in Plasmodium falciparum, which causes malaria. ODCase has been shown to exhibit unusual and interesting interactions with a variety of nucleotide ligands. Cytidine-5'-monophosphate (CMP) is a poor ligand of ODCase, and CMP binds to the active site of ODCase with an unusual orientation and conformation. We designed N3- and N4-modified CMP derivatives as novel ligands to ODCase. These novel CMP derivatives and their corresponding nucleosides were evaluated against Plasmodium falciparum ODCase and parasitic cultures, respectively. These derivatives exhibited improved inhibition of the enzyme catalytic activity, displayed interesting binding conformations and unusual molecular rearrangements of the ligands. These findings with the modified CMP nucleotides underscored the potential of transformation of poor ligands to ODCase into novel inhibitors of this drug target.</p>

<p>The effect of the Y108V mutation of human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (hGST P1-1) on the binding of the diuretic drug ethacrynic acid (EA) and its glutathione conjugate (EASG) was investigated by calorimetric, spectrofluorimetric, and crystallographic studies. The mutation Tyr 108 --&gt; Val resulted in a 3D-structure very similar to the wild type (wt) enzyme, where both the hydrophobic ligand binding site (H-site) and glutathione binding site (G-site) are unchanged except for the mutation itself. However, due to a slight increase in the hydrophobicity of the H-site, as a consequence of the mutation, an increase in the entropy was observed. The Y108V mutation does not affect the affinity of EASG for the enzyme, which has a higher affinity (K(d) approximately 0.5 microM) when compared with those of the parent compounds, K(d) (EA) approximately 13 microM, K(d) (GSH) approximately 25 microM. The EA moiety of the conjugate binds in the H-site of Y108V mutant in a fashion completely different to those observed in the crystal structures of the EA or EASG wt complex structures. We further demonstrate that the Delta C(p) values of binding can also be correlated with the potential stacking interactions between ligand and residues located in the binding sites as predicted from crystal structures. Moreover, the mutation does not significantly affect the global stability of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that calorimetric measurements maybe useful in determining the preference of binding (the binding mode) for a drug to a specific site of the enzyme, even in the absence of structural information.</p>

<p>Human factor D (FD) is a self-inhibited thrombin-like serine proteinase that is critical for amplification of the complement immune response. FD is activated by its substrate through interactions outside the active site. The substrate-binding, or `exosite', region displays a well defined and rigid conformation in FD. In contrast, remarkable flexibility is observed in thrombin and related proteinases, in which Na(+) and ligand binding is implied in allosteric regulation of enzymatic activity through protein dynamics. Here, ensemble refinement (ER) of FD and thrombin crystal structures is used to evaluate structure and dynamics simultaneously. A comparison with previously published NMR data for thrombin supports the ER analysis. The R202A FD variant has enhanced activity towards artificial peptides and simultaneously displays active and inactive conformations of the active site. ER revealed pronounced disorder in the exosite loops for this FD variant, reminiscent of thrombin in the absence of the stabilizing Na(+) ion. These data indicate that FD exhibits conformational dynamics like thrombin, but unlike in thrombin a mechanism has evolved in FD that locks the unbound native state into an ordered inactive conformation via the self-inhibitory loop. Thus, ensemble refinement of X-ray crystal structures may represent an approach alternative to spectroscopy to explore protein dynamics in atomic detail. </p>

<p>The coding sequence of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 slr0095 gene was cloned and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. The corresponding enzyme was classified as a cation- and S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase (SynOMT), consistent with considerable amino acid sequence identities to eukaryotic O-methyltransferases (OMTs). The substrate specificity of SynOMT was similar with those of plant and mammalian CCoAOMT-like proteins accepting a variety of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids as substrates. In contrast to the known mammalian and plant enzymes, which exclusively methylate the meta-hydroxyl position of aromatic di- and trihydroxy systems, Syn-OMT also methylates the para-position of hydroxycinnamic acids like 5-hydroxyferulic and 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid, resulting in the formation of novel compounds. The x-ray structure of SynOMT indicates that the active site allows for two alternative orientations of the hydroxylated substrates in comparison to the active sites of animal and plant enzymes, consistent with the observed preferred para-methylation and position promiscuity. Lys(3) close to the N terminus of the recombinant protein appears to play a key role in the activity of the enzyme. The possible implications of these results with respect to modifications of precursors of polymers like lignin are discussed.</p>

<p>Nucleoside Monophosphate Kinases (NMPKs) family are key enzymes in nucleotide metabolism. Bacterial UMPKs depart from the main superfamily of NMPKs. Having no eukaryotic counterparts they represent attractive therapeutic targets. They are regulated by GTP and UTP, while showing different mechanisms in Gram(+), Gram(-) and archaeal bacteria. In this work, we have characterized the mycobacterial UMPK (UMPKmt) combining enzymatic and structural investigations with site-directed mutagenesis. UMPKmt exhibits cooperativity toward ATP and an allosteric regulation by GTP and UTP. The crystal structure of the complex of UMPKmt with GTP solved at 2.5 Å, was merely identical to the modelled apo-form, in agreement with SAXS experiments. Only a small stretch of residues was affected upon nucleotide binding, pointing out the role of macromolecular dynamics rather than major structural changes in the allosteric regulation of bacterial UMPKs. We further probe allosteric regulation by site-directed mutagenesis. In particular, a key residue involved in the allosteric regulation of this enzyme was identified.</p>

<p>We have used chemical protein synthesis and advanced physical methods to probe dynamics-function correlations for the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme that has received considerable attention as a target for the treatment of AIDS. Chemical synthesis was used to prepare a series of unique analogues of the HIV-1 protease in which the flexibility of the "flap" structures (residues 37-61 in each monomer of the homodimeric protein molecule) was systematically varied. These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations. We show that conformational isomerization in the flaps is correlated with structural reorganization of residues in the active site, and that it is preorganization of the active site that is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis.</p>

<p>Protein tyrosine phosphatases play important roles in many signaling cascades involved in human disease. The identification of druglike inhibitors for these targets is a major challenge, and the discovery of suitable phosphotyrosine (pY) mimetics remains one of the key difficulties. Here we describe an extension of tethering technology, "breakaway tethering", which is ideally suited for discovering such new chemical entities. The approach involves first irreversibly modifying a protein with an extender that contains both a masked thiol and a known pY mimetic. The extender is then cleaved to release the pY mimetic, unmasking the thiol. The resulting protein is screened against a library of disulfide-containing small molecule fragments; any molecules with inherent affinity for the pY binding site will preferentially form disulfides with the extender, allowing for their identification by mass spectrometry. The ability to start from a known substrate mimimizes perturbation of protein structure and increases the opportunity to probe the active site using tethering. We applied this approach to the anti-diabetic protein PTP1B to discover a pY mimetic which belongs to a new molecular class and which binds in a novel fashion.</p>

<p>The pH-dependent activity of wild-type Bacillus circulans xylanase (BcX) is set by the pK(a) values of its nucleophile Glu78 and general acid/base Glu172. Herein, we examined several strategies to manipulate these pK(a) values and thereby shift the pH(opt) at which BcX is optimally active. Altering the global charge of BcX through random succinylation had no significant effect. Mutation of residues near or within the active site of BcX, but not directly contacting the catalytic carboxyls, either had little effect or reduced its pH(opt), primarily by lowering the apparent pK(a) value of Glu78. However, mutations causing the largest pK(a) changes also impaired activity. Although not found as a general acid/base in naturally occurring xylanases, substitution of Glu172 with a His lowered the pH(opt) of BcX from 5.6 to 4.7 while retaining 8% activity toward a xylobioside substrate. Mutation of Asn35, which contacts Glu172, to either His or Glu also led to a reduction in pH(opt) by ~1.2 units. Detailed pK(a) measurements by NMR spectroscopy revealed that, despite the opposite charges of the introduced residues, both the N35H and N35E forms of BcX utilize a reverse protonation mechanism. In this mechanism, the pK(a) value of the general acid is lower than that of the nucleophile, and only a small population of enzyme is in a catalytically competent ionization state. However, overall activity is maintained due to the increased strength of the general acid. This study illustrates several routes for altering the pH-dependent properties of xylanases, while also providing valuable insights into complex protein electrostatics.</p>

<p>Two new crystal structures of Bacillus stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) afford evidence that a closed interdomain hinge angle requires a covalent bond between AMP and an occupant of either pyrophosphate or tryptophan subsite. They also are within experimental error of a cluster of structures observed in a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation showing partial active-site assembly. Further, the highest energy structure in a minimum action pathway computed by using elastic network models for Open and Pretransition state (PreTS) conformations for the fully liganded TrpRS monomer is intermediate between that simulated structure and a partially disassembled structure from a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics trajectory for the unliganded PreTS. These mutual consistencies provide unexpected validation of inferences drawn from molecular simulations.</p>

<p>The disulfide bond between Cys14 and Cys38 of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor lies on the surface of the inhibitor and forms part of the protease-binding region. The functional properties of three variants lacking this disulfide, with one or both of the Cys residues replaced with Ser, were examined, and X-ray crystal structures of the complexes with bovine trypsin were determined and refined to the 1.58-A resolution limit. The crystal structure of the complex formed with the mutant with both Cys residues replaced was nearly identical with that of the complex containing the wild-type protein, with the Ser oxygen atoms positioned to replace the disulfide bond with a hydrogen bond. The two structures of the complexes with single replacements displayed small local perturbations with alternate conformations of the Ser side chains. Despite the absence of the disulfide bond, the crystallographic temperature factors show no evidence of increased flexibility in the complexes with the mutant inhibitors. All three of the variants were cleaved by trypsin more rapidly than the wild-type inhibitor, by as much as 10,000-fold, indicating that the covalent constraint normally imposed by the disulfide contributes to the remarkable resistance to hydrolysis displayed by the wild-type protein. The rates of hydrolysis display an unusual dependence on pH over the range of 3.5-8.0, decreasing at the more alkaline values, as compared with the increased hydrolysis rates for normal substrates under these conditions. These observations can be accounted for by a model for inhibition in which an acyl-enzyme intermediate forms at a significant rate but is rapidly converted back to the enzyme-inhibitor complex by nucleophilic attack by the newly created amino group. The model suggests that a lack of flexibility in the acyl-enzyme intermediate, rather than the enzyme-inhibitor complex, may be a key factor in the ability of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and similar inhibitors to resist hydrolysis.</p>

<p>Cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) is the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase initiating the major pathways of cholesterol removal from the brain, and bicalutamide (BIC) is a drug of choice for the treatment of progressive androgen-dependent prostate cancer. We evaluated the interactions of BIC with CYP46A1 by x-ray crystallography and by conducting solution and mutagenesis studies. Because BIC is administered to patients as a racemic mixture of the S and R isomers, we studied all three, racemic BIC as well as the S and R isomers. Co-crystallization of CYP46A1 with racemic BIC led to structure determinations at 2.1 Å resolution with the drug complexes exhibiting novel properties. Both BIC isomers bind to the CYP46A1 active site in very similar single orientation and adopt an energetically unfavorable folded conformation. This folded BIC conformation is correlated with drug-induced localized shifts of amino acid side chains in CYP46A1 and unusual interactions in the CYP46A1-BIC complex. One of these interactions involves a water molecule that is coordinated to the P450 heme iron and also hydrogen-bonded to the BIC nitrile. Due to polarization of the water in this environment, the heme elicits previously unreported types of P450 spectral responses. We also observed that access to the P450 active site was affected by differential recognition of S versus R isomers at the CYP46A1 surface arising from BIC conformational polymorphism.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of a recombinant form of the proteinase encoded by the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV PR) has been solved at 2 A resolution and refined to an R-factor of 0.148. The refined structure includes a peptidomimetic, statine-based inhibitor, LP-149, which is an even more potent inhibitor of HIV PR. Kinetic parameters were obtained for the cleavage of five substrates by FIV PR, and inhibition constants were measured for four inhibitors. The structure of FIV PR resembles other related retroviral enzymes although few inhibitors of HIV PR are capable of inhibiting FIV PR. The structure of FIV PR will enhance our knowledge of this class of enzymes, and will direct testing of new proteinase inhibitors in a feline animal model.</p>

<p>One of the major problems encountered in antiviral therapy against AIDS is the emergence of viral variants that exhibit drug resistance. The sequences of proteases (PRs) from related retroviruses sometimes include, at structurally equivalent positions, amino acids identical to those found in drug-resistant forms of HIV-1 PR. The statine-based inhibitor LP-130 was found to be a universal, nanomolar-range inhibitor against all tested retroviral PRs. We solved the crystal structures of LP-130 in complex with retroviral PRs from HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus, and equine infectious anemia virus and compared the structures to determine the differences in the interactions between the inhibitor and the active-site residues of the enzymes. This comparison shows an extraordinary similarity in the binding modes of the inhibitor molecules. The only exceptions are the different conformations of naphthylalanine side chains at the P3/P3' positions, which might be responsible for the variation in the Ki values. These findings indicate that successful inhibition of different retroviral PRs by LP-130 is achieved because this compound can be accommodated without serious conformational differences, despite the variations in the type of residues forming the active-site region. Although strong, specific interactions between the ligand and the enzyme might improve the potency of the inhibitor, the absence of such interactions seems to favor the universality of the compound. Hence, the ability of potential anti-AIDS drugs to inhibit multiple retroviral PRs might indicate their likelihood of not eliciting drug resistance. These studies may also contribute to the development of a small-animal model for preclinical testing of antiviral compounds.</p>

<p>Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) cleave neuronal proteins responsible for neurotransmitter release, causing the neuroparalytic disease botulism. BoNT serotypes B, D, F and G cleave and inactivate vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), each at a unique peptide bond. The specificity of BoNTs depends on the mode of substrate recognition. We have investigated the mechanism of substrate recognition of BoNT F by determining the crystal structures of its complex with two substrate-based inhibitors, VAMP 22-58/Gln58D-cysteine and 27-58/Gln58D-cysteine. The inhibitors bind to BoNT F in the canonical direction (as seen for BoNTs A and E substrates) but are positioned specifically via three major exosites away from the active site. The cysteine sulfur of the inhibitors interacts with the zinc and exists as sulfinic acid in the inhibitor VAMP 27-58/Gln58D-cysteine. Arg133 and Arg171, which form part of two separate exosites, are crucial for substrate binding and catalysis.</p>

<p>Human Hint1 suppresses specific gene transcription by interacting with the transcription factor MITF in mast cells. Hint1 activity is connected to lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), a member of the universal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase family that catalyzes specific aminoacylation of their cognate tRNAs, through an aminoacyl adenylate (aa-AMP) intermediate. During immune activation, LysRS produces a side-product diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap(4)A) from the condensation of Lys-AMP with ATP. The pleiotropic signaling molecule Ap(4)A then binds Hint1 to promote activation of MITF-target gene transcription. Earlier work showed that Hint1 can also bind and hydrolyze Lys-AMP, possibly to constrain Ap(4)A production. Because Ap(4)A can result from condensation of other aa-AMP's with ATP, the specificity of the Hint1 aa-AMP-hydrolysis activity is of interest. Here we show that Hint1 has broad specificity for adenylate hydrolysis, whose structural basis we revealed through high-resolution structures of Hint1 in complex with three different aa-AMP analogues. Hint1 recognizes only the common main chain of the aminoacyl moiety, and has no contact with the aa side chain. The α-amino group is anchored by a cation-pi interaction with Trp123 at the C-terminus of Hint1. These results reveal the structural basis for the remarkable adenylate surveillance activity of Hint1, to potentially control Ap(4)A levels in the cell.</p>

<p>Disruption of the unusual thiol-based redox homeostasis mechanisms in Staphylococcus aureus represents a unique opportunity to identify new metabolic processes and new targets for intervention. Targeting uncommon aspects of CoASH biosynthetic and redox functions in S. aureus, the antibiotic CJ-15,801 has recently been demonstrated to be an antimetabolite of the CoASH biosynthetic pathway in this organism; CoAS-mimetics containing α,β-unsaturated sulfone and carboxyl moieties have also been exploited as irreversible inhibitors of S. aureus coenzyme A-disulfide reductase (SaCoADR). In this work we have determined the crystal structures of three of these covalent SaCoADR-inhibitor complexes, prepared by inactivation of wild-type enzyme during turnover. The structures reveal the covalent linkage between the active-site Cys43-S(γ) and C(β) of the vinyl sulfone or carboxyl moiety. The full occupancy of two inhibitor molecules per enzyme dimer, together with kinetic analyses of the wild-type/C43S heterodimer, indicates that half-sites-reactivity is not a factor during normal catalytic turnover. Further, we provide the structures of SaCoADR active-site mutants; in particular, Tyr419'-OH plays dramatic roles in directing intramolecular reduction of the Cys43-SSCoA redox center, in the redox asymmetry observed for the two FAD per dimer in NADPH titrations, and in catalysis. The two conformations observed for the Ser43 side chain in the C43S mutant structure lend support to a conformational switch for Cys43-S(γ) during its catalytic Cys43-SSCoA/Cys43-SH redox cycle. Finally, the structures of the three inhibitor complexes provide a framework for design of more effective inhibitors with therapeutic potential against several major bacterial pathogens.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Cel44A, which is one of the enzymatic components of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum, was solved at a resolution of 0.96 A. This enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase family (GH family) 44. The structure reveals that Cel44A consists of a TIM-like barrel domain and a beta-sandwich domain. The wild-type and the E186Q mutant structures complexed with substrates suggest that two glutamic acid residues, Glu(186) and Glu(359), are the active residues of the enzyme. Biochemical experiments were performed to confirm this idea. The structural features indicate that GH family 44 belongs to clan GH-A and that the reaction catalyzed by Cel44A is retaining type hydrolysis. The stereochemical course of hydrolysis was confirmed by a (1)H NMR experiment using the reduced cellooligosaccharide as a substrate.</p>

<p>Starting from indole-based C-3 pyridone HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor 2, structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigations of the indole N-1 benzyl moiety were performed. This study led to the discovery of irreversible inhibitors with p-fluoro-sulfone- or p-fluoro-nitro-substituted N-1 benzyl groups which achieved breakthrough replicon assay potency (EC(50) = 1 nM). The formation of a covalent bond with adjacent cysteine-366 thiol was was proved by mass spectroscopy and X-ray crystal structure studies. The C-5 ethyl C-2 carboxylic acid derivative 47 had an excellent oral area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 18 μM·h (10 mg/kg). Its oral exposure in monkeys and dogs was also very good. The NMR ALARM assay, mass spectroscopy experiments, in vitro counter screening, and toxicology assays demonstrated that the covalent bond formation between compound 47 and the protein was highly selective and specific. The overall excellent profile of 47 made it an interesting candidate for further investigation.</p>

<p>The sulfonamide antibiotics inhibit dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), a key enzyme in the folate pathway of bacteria and primitive eukaryotes. However, resistance mutations have severely compromised the usefulness of these drugs. We report structural, computational, and mutagenesis studies on the catalytic and resistance mechanisms of DHPS. By performing the enzyme-catalyzed reaction in crystalline DHPS, we have structurally characterized key intermediates along the reaction pathway. Results support an S(N)1 reaction mechanism via formation of a novel cationic pterin intermediate. We also show that two conserved loops generate a substructure during catalysis that creates a specific binding pocket for p-aminobenzoic acid, one of the two DHPS substrates. This substructure, together with the pterin-binding pocket, explains the roles of the conserved active-site residues and reveals how sulfonamide resistance arises.</p>

<p>Activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) is a zinc-containing carboxypeptidase and significantly inhibits fibrinolysis. TAFIa inhibitors are thus expected to act as profibrinolytic agents. We recently reported the design and synthesis of selenium-containing inhibitors of TAFIa and their inhibitory activity. Here we report the crystal structures of potent selenium-, sulfur-, and phosphinic acid-containing inhibitors bound to porcine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (ppCPB). ppCPB is a TAFIa homologue and is surrogate TAFIa for crystallographic analysis. Crystal structures of ppCPB complexed with selenium compound 1a, its sulfur analogue 2, and phosphinic acid derivative EF6265 were determined at 1.70, 2.15, and 1.90 Å resolution, respectively. Each inhibitor binds to the active site of ppCPB in a similar manner to that observed for previously reported inhibitors. Thus, in complexes, selenium, sulfur, and phosphinic acid oxygen coordinate to zinc in ppCPB. This is the first observation and report of selenium coordinating to zinc in CPB. </p>

<p>3-Deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) catalyzes the first step in the shikimate pathway, the pathway responsible for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids Trp, Phe, and Tyr. Unlike many other organisms that produce up to three isozymes, each feedback-regulated by one of the aromatic amino acid pathway end products, Mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses a single DAH7PS enzyme that can be controlled by combinations of aromatic amino acids. This study shows that the synergistic inhibition of this enzyme by a combination of Trp and Phe can be significantly augmented by the addition of Tyr. We used X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and isothermal titration calorimetry studies to show that DAH7PS from M. tuberculosis possesses a Tyr-selective site in addition to the Trp and Phe sites, revealing an unusual and highly sophisticated network of three synergistic allosteric sites on one enzyme. This ternary inhibitory response, by a combination of all three aromatic amino acids, allows a tunable response of the protein to changing metabolic demands.</p>

<p>2H phosphoesterases catalyze reactions on nucleotide substrates and contain two conserved histidine residues in the active site. Very limited information is currently available on the details of the active site and substrate/product binding during the catalytic cycle of these enzymes. We performed a comprehensive X-ray crystallographic study of mouse 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a membrane-associated enzyme present at high levels in the tetrapod myelin sheath. We determined crystal structures of the CNPase phosphodiesterase domain complexed with substrate, product, and phosphorothioate analogues. The data provide detailed information on the CNPase reaction mechanism, including substrate binding mode and coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule. Linked to the reaction, an open/close motion of the β5-α7 loop is observed. The role of the N terminus of helix α7--unique for CNPase in the 2H family--during the reaction indicates that 2H phosphoesterases differ in their respective reaction mechanisms despite the conserved catalytic residues. Furthermore, based on small-angle X-ray scattering, we present a model for the full-length enzyme, indicating that the two domains of CNPase form an elongated molecule. Finally, based on our structural data and a comprehensive bioinformatics study, we discuss the conservation of CNPase in various organisms.</p>

<p>Based on the X-ray crystals of cocrystallized cyanopeptide-trypsin and cyanopeptide-thrombin-com-plexes, a rational drug design succeeded in the establishment of suitable lead structures for the development of new potential inhibitors of thrombin. This report deals with the design and X-ray crystallography data of new synthetic, low-molecular weight cyanopeptide-analogues, RA-1008 and RA-1014, complexed with human alpha-thrombin at 1.85 A resolution. The crystal structures of the complexes reveal, by analogy with modeling studies, that the salt bridge of Asp189 to this type of synthetic thrombin inhibitors leads to an almost identically binding into the S1 specificity pocket in comparison to the complex of the natural products, whereas in the overall binding modes the P2-P4 substructures differ from those of the leads. The strongest member of the second series of described thrombin inhibitors, RA-1014, shows in the crystal complex with thrombin a slightly higher affinity towards the enzyme than RA-1008 as confirmed by inhibition tests. This result and other key informations will be helpful to design a more potent series of inhibitors.</p>

<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized by two isoforms of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67). GAD67 is constitutively active and is responsible for basal GABA production. In contrast, GAD65, an autoantigen in type I diabetes, is transiently activated in response to the demand for extra GABA in neurotransmission, and cycles between an active holo form and an inactive apo form. We have determined the crystal structures of N-terminal truncations of both GAD isoforms. The structure of GAD67 shows a tethered loop covering the active site, providing a catalytic environment that sustains GABA production. In contrast, the same catalytic loop is inherently mobile in GAD65. Kinetic studies suggest that mobility in the catalytic loop promotes a side reaction that results in cofactor release and GAD65 autoinactivation. These data reveal the molecular basis for regulation of GABA homeostasis.</p>

<p>Long term survival of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans is linked to the immunomodulatory potential of its complex cell wall glycolipids, which include the phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) series as well as the related lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan glycoconjugates. PIM biosynthesis is initiated by a set of cytosolic α-mannosyltransferases, catalyzing glycosyl transfer from the activated saccharide donor GDP-α-D-mannopyranose to the acceptor phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) in an ordered and regio-specific fashion. Herein, we report the crystal structure of mannosyltransferase Corynebacterium glutamicum PimB' in complex with nucleotide to a resolution of 2.0 Å. PimB' attaches mannosyl selectively to the 6-OH of the inositol moiety of PI. Two crystal forms and GDP- versus GDP-α-d-mannopyranose-bound complexes reveal flexibility of the nucleotide conformation as well as of the structural framework of the active site. Structural comparison, docking of the saccharide acceptor, and site-directed mutagenesis pin regio-selectivity to a conserved Asp residue in the N-terminal domain that forces presentation of the correct inositol hydroxyl to the saccharide donor.</p>

<p>Inhibition of CDK2/CA (cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A complex) activity through blocking of the substrate recognition site in the cyclin A subunit has been demonstrated to be an effective method for inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. We have used the cyclin binding motif (CBM) present in the tumor suppressor proteins p21(WAF1) and p27(KIP1) as a template to optimize the minimal sequence necessary for CDK2/CA inhibition. A series of peptides were prepared, containing nonnatural amino acids, which possess nano- to micromolar CDK2-inhibitory activity. Here we present X-ray structures of the protein complex CDK2/CA, together with the cyclin groove-bound peptides H-Ala-Ala-Abu-Arg-Ser-Leu-Ile-(p-F-Phe)-NH(2) (peptide 1), H-Arg-Arg-Leu-Ile-Phe-NH(2) (peptide 2), Ac-Arg-Arg-Leu-Asn-(m-Cl-Phe)-NH(2) (peptide 3), H-Arg-Arg-Leu-Asn-(p-F-Phe)-NH(2) (peptide 4), and H-Cit-Cit-Leu-Ile-(p-F-Phe)-NH(2) (peptide 5). Some of the peptide complexes presented here were obtained through the novel technique of ligand exchange within protein crystals. This method may find general application for obtaining complex structures of proteins with surface-bound ligands.</p>

<p>Aromatic amine dehydrogenase uses a tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor to oxidatively deaminate primary aromatic amines. In the reductive half-reaction, a proton is transferred from the substrate C1 to betaAsp-128 O-2, in a reaction that proceeds by H-tunneling. Using solution studies, kinetic crystallography, and computational simulation we show that the mechanism of oxidation of aromatic carbinolamines is similar to amine oxidation, but that carbinolamine oxidation occurs at a substantially reduced rate. This has enabled us to determine for the first time the structure of the intermediate prior to the H-transfer/reduction step. The proton-betaAsp-128 O-2 distance is approximately 3.7A, in contrast to the distance of approximately 2.7A predicted for the intermediate formed with the corresponding primary amine substrate. This difference of approximately 1.0 A is due to an unexpected conformation of the substrate moiety, which is supported by molecular dynamic simulations and reflected in the approximately 10(7)-fold slower TTQ reduction rate with phenylaminoethanol compared with that with primary amines. A water molecule is observed near TTQ C-6 and is likely derived from the collapse of the preceding carbinolamine TTQ-adduct. We suggest this water molecule is involved in consecutive proton transfers following TTQ reduction, and is ultimately repositioned near the TTQ O-7 concomitant with protein rearrangement. For all carbinolamines tested, highly stable amide-TTQ adducts are formed following proton abstraction and TTQ reduction. Slow hydrolysis of the amide occurs after, rather than prior to, TTQ oxidation and leads ultimately to a carboxylic acid product.</p>

<p>The peripheral anionic site on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), located at the active center gorge entry, encompasses overlapping binding sites for allosteric activators and inhibitors; yet, the molecular mechanisms coupling this site to the active center at the gorge base to modulate catalysis remain unclear. The peripheral site has also been proposed to be involved in heterologous protein associations occurring during synaptogenesis or upon neurodegeneration. A novel crystal form of mouse AChE, combined with spectrophotometric analyses of the crystals, enabled us to solve unique structures of AChE with a free peripheral site, and as three complexes with peripheral site inhibitors: the phenylphenanthridinium ligands, decidium and propidium, and the pyrogallol ligand, gallamine, at 2.20-2.35 A resolution. Comparison with structures of AChE complexes with the peptide fasciculin or with organic bifunctional inhibitors unveils new structural determinants contributing to ligand interactions at the peripheral site, and permits a detailed topographic delineation of this site. Hence, these structures provide templates for designing compounds directed to the enzyme surface that modulate specific surface interactions controlling catalytic activity and non-catalytic heterologous protein associations.</p>

<p>Amylosucrases are sucrose-utilizing α-transglucosidases that naturally catalyze the synthesis of α-glucans, linked exclusively through α1,4-linkages. Side products and in particular sucrose isomers such as turanose and trehalulose are also produced by these enzymes. Here, we report the first structural and biophysical characterization of the most thermostable amylosucrase identified so far, the amylosucrase from Deinoccocus geothermalis (DgAS). The three-dimensional structure revealed a homodimeric quaternary organization, never reported before for other amylosucrases. A sequence signature of dimerization was identified from the analysis of the dimer interface and sequence alignments. By rigidifying the DgAS structure, the quaternary organization is likely to participate in the enhanced thermal stability of the protein. Amylosucrase specificity with respect to sucrose isomer formation (turanose or trehalulose) was also investigated. We report the first structures of the amylosucrases from Deinococcus geothermalis and Neisseria polysaccharea in complex with turanose. In the amylosucrase from N. polysaccharea (NpAS), key residues were found to force the fructosyl moiety to bind in an open state with the O3' ideally positioned to explain the preferential formation of turanose by NpAS. Such residues are either not present or not similarly placed in DgAS. As a consequence, DgAS binds the furanoid tautomers of fructose through a weak network of interactions to enable turanose formation. Such topology at subsite +1 is likely favoring other possible fructose binding modes in agreement with the higher amount of trehalulose formed by DgAS. Our findings help to understand the inter-relationships between amylosucrase structure, flexibility, function, and stability and provide new insight for amylosucrase design.</p>

<p>Phytases hydrolyse the phosphomonoesters of phytate (myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis phosphate) and thus find uses in plant and animal production through the mobilisation of phosphorus from this source. The structure of partially deglycosylated Aspergillus niger PhyA is presented in apo form and in complex with the potent inhibitor myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis sulfate, which by analogy with phytate provides a snapshot of the Michaelis complex. The structure explains the enzyme's preference for the 3'-phosphate of phytate. The apo-and inhibitor-bound forms are similar and no induced-fit mechanism operates. Furthermore the enzyme structure is apparently unaffected by the presence of glycosides on the surface. The new structures of A. niger PhyA are discussed in the context of protein engineering studies aimed at modulating pH preference and stability.</p>

<p>To optimize dual receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition, the E- and Z-isomers of 5-[2-(2-methoxyphenyl)prop-1-en-1-yl]furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamines (1a and 1b) were separated by HPLC and the X-ray crystal structures (2.0 and 1.4A, respectively) with mouse DHFR and NADPH as well as 1b with human DHFR (1.5A) were determined. The E- and Z-isomers adopt different binding modes when bound to mouse DHFR. A series of 2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidines 2-13 were designed and synthesized using the X-ray crystal structures of 1a and 1b with DHFR to increase their DHFR inhibitory activity. Wittig reactions of appropriate 2-methoxyphenyl ketones with 2,4-diamino-6-chloromethyl furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine afforded the C8-C9 unsaturated compounds 2-7 and catalytic reduction gave the saturated 8-13. Homologation of the C9-methyl analog maintains DHFR inhibitory activity. In addition, inhibition of EGFR and PDGFR-beta were discovered for saturated C9-homologated analogs 9 and 10 that were absent in the saturated C9-methyl analogs.</p>

<p>A library of 68 brominated fragments was screened against a new crystal form of inhibited HIV-1 protease in order to probe surface sites in soaking experiments. Often, fragments are weak binders with partial occupancy, resulting in weak, difficult-to-fit electron density. The use of a brominated fragment library addresses this challenge, as bromine can be located unequivocally via anomalous scattering. Data collection was carried out in an automated fashion using AutoDrug at SSRL. Novel hits were identified in the known surface sites: 3-bromo-2,6-dimethoxybenzoic acid (Br6) in the flap site and 1-bromo-2-naphthoic acid (Br27) in the exosite, expanding the chemistry of known fragments for development of higher affinity potential allosteric inhibitors. At the same time, mapping the binding sites of a number of weaker binding Br-fragments provides further insight into the nature of these surface pockets. </p>

<p>As part of our studies on the nitric oxide-related pathology of cerebral malaria, we show that the antioxidative enzyme glutathione reductase (GR) is inactivated by peroxynitrite, with GR from the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum being more sensitive than human GR. The crystal structure of modified human GR at 1.9-A resolution provides the first picture of protein inactivation by peroxynitrite and reveals that this is due to the exclusive nitration of 2 Tyr residues (residues 106 and 114) at the glutathione disulfide-binding site. The selective nitration explains the impairment of binding the peptide substrate and thus the nearly 1000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of glutathione reductase observed at physiologic pH. By oxidizing the catalytic dithiol to a disulfide, peroxynitrite itself can act as a substrate of unmodified and bisnitrated P. falciparum glutathione reductase.</p>

<p>We report the x-ray crystal structure of human topoisomerase I covalently joined to double-stranded DNA and bound to the clinically approved anticancer agent Topotecan. Topotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (-1) and downstream (+1) base pairs. Intercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing religation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the enzyme-substrate complex, Topotecan acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor. The structure can explain several of the known structure-activity relationships of the camptothecin family of anticancer drugs and suggests that there are at least two classes of mutations that can produce a drug-resistant enzyme. The first class includes changes to residues that contribute to direct interactions with the drug, whereas a second class would alter interactions with the DNA and thereby destabilize the drug-binding site.</p>

<p>Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor mediating innate antimicrobial immunity. It catalyzes the synthesis of a noncanonical cyclic dinucleotide, 2',5' cGAMP, that binds to STING and mediates the activation of TBK1 and IRF-3. Activated IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus and initiates the transcription of the IFN-β gene. The structure of mouse cGAS bound to an 18 bp dsDNA revealed that cGAS interacts with dsDNA through two binding sites, forming a 2:2 complex. Enzyme assays and IFN-β reporter assays of cGAS mutants demonstrated that interactions at both DNA binding sites are essential for cGAS activation. Mutagenesis and DNA binding studies showed that the two sites bind dsDNA cooperatively and that site B plays a critical role in DNA binding. The structure of mouse cGAS bound to dsDNA and 2',5' cGAMP provided insight into the catalytic mechanism of cGAS. These results demonstrated that cGAS is activated by dsDNA-induced oligomerization.</p>

<p>We describe herein a highly proficient class A beta-lactamase OIH-1 from the bacterium Oceanobacillus iheyensis, whose habitat is the sediment at a depth of 1050 m in the Pacific Ocean. The OIH-1 structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 1.25 A resolution. OIH-1 has evolved to be an extremely halotolerant beta-lactamase capable of hydrolyzing its substrates in the presence of NaCl at saturating concentration. Not only is this the most highly halotolerant bacterial enzyme structure known to date, it is also the highest resolution halophilic protein structure yet determined. Evolution of OIH-1 in the salinity of the ocean has resulted in a molecular surface that is coated with acidic residues, a marked difference from beta-lactamases of terrestrial sources. OIH-1 is the first example of an antibiotic-resistance enzyme that has evolved in the depths of the ocean in isolation from clinical selection and gives us an extraordinary glimpse into protein evolution under extreme conditions. It represents evidence for the existence of a reservoir of antibiotic-resistance enzymes in nature among microbial populations from deep oceanic sources.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of human group X (hGX) secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) has been solved to a resolution of 1.97 A. As expected the protein fold is similar to previously reported sPLA2 structures. The active site architecture, including the positions of the catalytic residues and the first and second shell water around the Ca2+ cofactor, are highly conserved and remarkably similar to the group IB and group IIA enzymes. Differences are seen in the structures following the (1-12)-N-terminal helix and at the C terminus. These regions are proposed to interact with the substrate membrane surface. The opening to the active site slot is considerably larger in hGX than in human group IIA sPLA2. Furthermore, the electrostatic surface potential of the hGX interfacial-binding surface does not resemble that of the human group IIA sPLA2; the former is highly neutral, whereas the latter is highly cationic. The cationic residues on this face of group IB and IIA enzymes have been implicated in membrane binding and in k(cat*) allostery. In contrast, hGX does not show activation by the anionic charge at the lipid interface when acting on phospholipid vesicles or short-chain phospholipid micelles. Together, the crystal structure and kinetic results of hGX supports the conclusion that it is as active on zwitterionic as on anionic interfaces, and thus it is predicted to target the zwitterionic membrane surfaces of mammalian cells.</p>

<p>The flavoprotein nitroalkane oxidase (NAO) from Fusarium oxysporum catalyzes the oxidation of primary and secondary nitroalkanes to their respective aldehydes and ketones. Structurally, the enzyme is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily. To date no enzymes other than that from F. oxysporum have been annotated as NAOs. To identify additional potential NAOs, the available database was searched for enzymes in which the active site residues Asp402, Arg409, and Ser276 were conserved. Of the several fungal enzymes identified in this fashion, PODANSg2158 from Podospora anserina was selected for expression and characterization. The recombinant enzyme is a flavoprotein with activity on nitroalkanes comparable to the F. oxysporum NAO, although the substrate specificity is somewhat different. Asp399, Arg406, and Ser273 in PODANSg2158 correspond to the active site triad in F. oxysporum NAO. The k(cat)/K(M)-pH profile with nitroethane shows a pK(a) of 5.9 that is assigned to Asp399 as the active site base. Mutation of Asp399 to asparagine decreases the k(cat)/K(M) value for nitroethane over 2 orders of magnitude. The R406K and S373A mutations decrease this kinetic parameter by 64- and 3-fold, respectively. The structure of PODANSg2158 has been determined at a resolution of 2.0 A, confirming its identification as an NAO.</p>

<p>Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) catalyzes the interconversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Photosynthetic organisms generally contain two isoforms of TPI located in both cytoplasm and chloroplasts. While the cytoplasmic TPI is involved in the glycolysis, the chloroplastic isoform participates in the Calvin-Benson cycle, a key photosynthetic process responsible for carbon fixation. Compared with its cytoplasmic counterpart, the functional features of chloroplastic TPI have been poorly investigated and its three-dimensional structure has not been solved. Recently, several studies proposed TPI as a potential target of different redox modifications including dithiol/disulfide interchanges, glutathionylation, and nitrosylation. However, neither the effects on protein activity nor the molecular mechanisms underlying these redox modifications have been investigated. Here, we have produced recombinantly and purified TPI from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr). The biochemical properties of the enzyme were delineated and its crystallographic structure was determined at a resolution of 1.1 Å. CrTPI is a homodimer with subunits containing the typical (β/α)8-barrel fold. Although no evidence for TRX regulation was obtained, CrTPI was found to undergo glutathionylation by oxidized glutathione and trans-nitrosylation by nitrosoglutathione, confirming its sensitivity to multiple redox modifications. </p>

<p>Leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase (LTA4H) is a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the committed step in the formation of the proinflammatory mediator LTB4. Recently, the chemotactic tripeptide Pro-Gly-Pro was identified as an endogenous aminopeptidase substrate for LTA4 hydrolase. Here, we determined the crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase in complex with a Pro-Gly-Pro analog at 1.72 Å. From the structure, which includes the catalytic water, and mass spectrometric analysis of enzymatic hydrolysis products of Pro-Gly-Pro, it could be inferred that LTA4 hydrolase cleaves at the N terminus of the palindromic tripeptide. Furthermore, we designed a small molecule, 4-(4-benzylphenyl)thiazol-2-amine, denoted ARM1, that inhibits LTB4 synthesis in human neutrophils (IC50 of ∼0.5 μM) and conversion of LTA4 into LTB4 by purified LTA4H with a Ki of 2.3 μM. In contrast, 50- to 100-fold higher concentrations of ARM1 did not significantly affect hydrolysis of Pro-Gly-Pro. A 1.62-Å crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase in a dual complex with ARM1 and the Pro-Gly-Pro analog revealed that ARM1 binds in the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the ω-end of LTA4, distant from the aminopeptidase active site, thus providing a molecular basis for its inhibitory profile. Hence, ARM1 selectively blocks conversion of LTA4 into LTB4, although sparing the enzyme's anti-inflammatory aminopeptidase activity (i.e., degradation and inactivation of Pro-Gly-Pro). ARM1 represents a new class of LTA4 hydrolase inhibitor that holds promise for improved anti-inflammatory properties. </p>

<p>Biotin-dependent enzymes catalyze carboxyl transfer reactions by efficiently coordinating multiple reactions between spatially distinct active sites. Pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a multifunctional biotin-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the bicarbonate- and MgATP-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, an important anaplerotic reaction in mammalian tissues. To complete the overall reaction, the tethered biotin prosthetic group must first gain access to the biotin carboxylase domain and become carboxylated and then translocate to the carboxyltransferase domain, where the carboxyl group is transferred from biotin to pyruvate. Here, we report structural and kinetic evidence for the formation of a substrate-induced biotin binding pocket in the carboxyltransferase domain of PC from Rhizobium etli. Structures of the carboxyltransferase domain reveal that R. etli PC occupies a symmetrical conformation in the absence of the biotin carboxylase domain and that the carboxyltransferase domain active site is conformationally rearranged upon pyruvate binding. This conformational change is stabilized by the interaction of the conserved residues Asp(590) and Tyr(628) and results in the formation of the biotin binding pocket. Site-directed mutations at these residues reduce the rate of biotin-dependent reactions but have no effect on the rate of biotin-independent oxaloacetate decarboxylation. Given the conservation with carboxyltransferase domains in oxaloacetate decarboxylase and transcarboxylase, the structure-based mechanism described for PC may be applicable to the larger family of biotin-dependent enzymes. </p>

<p>Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) is a DinB homolog that belongs to the recently described Y-family of DNA polymerases, which are best characterized by their low-fidelity synthesis on undamaged DNA templates and propensity to traverse normally replication-blocking lesions. Crystal structures of Dpo4 in ternary complexes with DNA and an incoming nucleotide, either correct or incorrect, have been solved at 1.7 A and 2.1 A resolution, respectively. Despite a conserved active site and a hand-like configuration similar to all known polymerases, Dpo4 makes limited and nonspecific contacts with the replicating base pair, thus relaxing base selection. Dpo4 is also captured in the crystal translocating two template bases to the active site at once, suggesting a possible mechanism for bypassing thymine dimers.</p>

<p>The use of third generation synchrotron sources has led to renewed concern about the effect of ionizing radiation on crystalline biological samples. In general, the problem is seen as one to be avoided. However, in this paper, it is shown that, far from being a hindrance to successful structure determination, radiation damage provides an opportunity for phasing macromolecular structures. This is successfully demonstrated for both a protein and an oligonucleotide, by way of which complete models were built automatically. The possibility that, through the exploitation of radiation damage, the phase problem could become less of a barrier to macromolecular crystal structure determination is discussed.</p>

<p>Serine acetyltransferase (SAT) catalyzes the limiting reaction in plant and microbial biosynthesis of cysteine. In addition to its enzymatic function, SAT forms a macromolecular complex with O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. Formation of the cysteine regulatory complex (CRC) is a critical biochemical control feature in plant sulfur metabolism. Here we present the 1.75-3.0 Å resolution x-ray crystal structures of soybean (Glycine max) SAT (GmSAT) in apoenzyme, serine-bound, and CoA-bound forms. The GmSAT-serine and GmSAT-CoA structures provide new details on substrate interactions in the active site. The crystal structures and analysis of site-directed mutants suggest that His(169) and Asp(154) form a catalytic dyad for general base catalysis and that His(189) may stabilize the oxyanion reaction intermediate. Glu(177) helps to position Arg(203) and His(204) and the β1c-β2c loop for serine binding. A similar role for ionic interactions formed by Lys(230) is required for CoA binding. The GmSAT structures also identify Arg(253) as important for the enhanced catalytic efficiency of SAT in the CRC and suggest that movement of the residue may stabilize CoA binding in the macromolecular complex. Differences in the effect of cold on GmSAT activity in the isolated enzyme versus the enzyme in the CRC were also observed. A role for CRC formation as a molecular chaperone to maintain SAT activity in response to an environmental stress is proposed for this multienzyme complex in plants. </p>

<p>In previous studies [Delker, S. L., et al. (2010), J. Am. Chem. Soc. 132, 5437-5442], we determined the crystal structures of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in complex with nNOS-selective chiral pyrrolidine inhibitors, designed to have an aminopyridine group bound over the heme where it can electrostatically interact with the conserved active site Glu residue. However, in addition to the expected binding mode with the (S,S)-cis inhibitors, an unexpected "flipped" orientation was observed for the (R,R)-cis enantiomers. In the flipped mode, the aminopyridine extends out of the active site where it interacts with one heme propionate. This prompted us to design and synthesize symmetric "double-headed" inhibitors with an aminopyridine at each end of a bridging ring structure [Xue, F., Delker, S. L., Li, H., Fang, J., Jamal, J., Martásek, P., Roman, L. J., Poulos, T. L., and Silverman, R. B. Symmetric double-headed aminopyridines, a novel strategy for potent and membrane-permeable inhibitors of neuronal nitric oxide synthase. J. Med. Chem. (submitted for publication)]. One aminopyridine should interact with the active site Glu and the other with the heme propionate. Crystal structures of these double-headed aminopyridine inhibitors in complexes with nNOS show unexpected and significant protein and heme conformational changes induced by inhibitor binding that result in removal of the tetrahydrobiopterin (H(4)B) cofactor and creation of a new Zn(2+) site. These changes are due to binding of a second inhibitor molecule that results in the displacement of H(4)B and the placement of the inhibitor pyridine group in position to serve as a Zn(2+) ligand together with Asp, His, and a chloride ion. Binding of the second inhibitor molecule and generation of the Zn(2+) site do not occur in eNOS. Structural requirements for creation of the new Zn(2+) site in nNOS were analyzed in detail. These observations open the way for the potential design of novel inhibitors selective for nNOS.</p>

<p>Water is ubiquitously present in any biological system and has therefore to be regarded as an additional binding partner in the protein-ligand binding process. Upon complex formation, a new solvent-exposed surface is generated and water molecules from the first solvation layer will arrange around this newly formed surface. So far, the influence of such water arrangements on the ligand binding properties is unknown. In this study, the binding modes of nine congeneric phosphonamidate-type inhibitors with systematically varied, size-increasing hydrophobic P2 ' substituents (from methyl to phenylethyl) addressing the hydrophobic, solvent-exposed S2 ' pocket of thermolysin were analyzed by high-resolution crystal structures and correlated with their thermodynamic binding profiles as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Overall, ΔΔG spreads over 7.0 kJ mol(-1) , ΔΔH varies by 15.8 kJ mol(-1) , and -TΔΔS by 12.1 kJ mol(-1) . Throughout the series, these changes correlate remarkably well with the geometric differences of water molecules arranged adjacent to the P2 ' substituents. Ligands with medium-sized P2 ' substituents exhibit highest affinities, presumably because of their optimal solvation patterns around these complexes. The addition, removal, or rearrangement of even a single methyl group can result in a strong modulation of the adjacent water network pattern shifting from enthalpy to entropy-driven binding. In conclusion, the quality of a water network assembled around a protein-ligand complex influences the enthalpy/entropy signature and can even modulate affinity to a surprising extent. </p>

<p>The crystal structure of the thioacylenzyme intermediate of the phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been solved at 1.8A resolution. Formation of the intermediate was obtained by diffusion of the natural substrate within the crystal of the holoenzyme in the absence of inorganic phosphate. To define the soaking conditions suitable for the isolation and accumulation of the intermediate, a microspectrophotometric characterization of the reaction of GAPDH in single crystals was carried out, following NADH formation at 340 nm. When compared with the structure of the Michaelis complex (Didierjean, C., Corbier, C., Fatih, M., Favier, F., Boschi-Muller, S., Branlant, G., and Aubry, A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 12968-12976) the 206-210 loop is shifted and now forms part of the so-called "new P(i)" site. The locations of both the O1 atom and the C3-phosphate group of the substrate are also changed. Altogether, the results provide evidence for the flipping of the C3-phosphate group occurring concomitantly or after the redox step.</p>

<p>During the last decade the use of transaminases for the production of pharmaceutical and fine chemical intermediates has attracted a great deal of attention. Transaminases are versatile biocatalysts for the efficient production of amine intermediates and many have (S)-enantiospecificity. Transaminases with (R)-specificity are needed to expand the applications of these enzymes in biocatalysis. In this work we have identified a fungal putative (R)-specific transaminase from the Eurotiomycetes Nectria haematococca, cloned a synthetic version of this gene, demonstrated (R)-selective deamination of several substrates including (R)-α-methylbenzylamine, as well as production of (R)-amines, and determined its crystal structure. The crystal structures of the holoenzyme and the complex with an inhibitor gabaculine offer the first detailed insight into the structural basis for substrate specificity and enantioselectivity of the industrially important class of (R)-selective amine : pyruvate transaminases.</p>

<p>cAMP is an evolutionary conserved, prototypic second messenger regulating numerous cellular functions. In mammals, cAMP is synthesized by one of 10 homologous adenylyl cyclases (ACs): nine transmembrane enzymes and one soluble AC (sAC). Among these, only sAC is directly activated by bicarbonate (HCO3(-)); it thereby serves as a cellular sensor for HCO3(-), carbon dioxide (CO2), and pH in physiological functions, such as sperm activation, aqueous humor formation, and metabolic regulation. Here, we describe crystal structures of human sAC catalytic domains in the apo state and in complex with substrate analog, products, and regulators. The activator HCO3(-) binds adjacent to Arg176, which acts as a switch that enables formation of the catalytic cation sites. An anionic inhibitor, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, inhibits sAC through binding to the active site entrance, which blocks HCO3(-) activation through steric hindrance and trapping of the Arg176 side chain. Finally, product complexes reveal small, local rearrangements that facilitate catalysis. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for sAC catalysis and cellular HCO3(-) sensing and a basis for targeting this system with drugs. </p>

<p>Chalcone synthase (CHS) is pivotal for the biosynthesis of flavonoid antimicrobial phytoalexins and anthocyanin pigments in plants. It produces chalcone by condensing one p-coumaroyl- and three malonyl-coenzyme A thioesters into a polyketide reaction intermediate that cyclizes. The crystal structures of CHS alone and complexed with substrate and product analogs reveal the active site architecture that defines the sequence and chemistry of multiple decarboxylation and condensation reactions and provides a molecular understanding of the cyclization reaction leading to chalcone synthesis. The structure of CHS complexed with resveratrol also suggests how stilbene synthase, a related enzyme, uses the same substrates and an alternate cyclization pathway to form resveratrol. By using the three-dimensional structure and the large database of CHS-like sequences, we can identify proteins likely to possess novel substrate and product specificity. The structure elucidates the chemical basis of plant polyketide biosynthesis and provides a framework for engineering CHS-like enzymes to produce new products.</p>

<p>We have previously proposed triosephosphate isomerase of Giardia lamblia (GlTIM) as a target for rational drug design against giardiasis, one of the most common parasitic infections in humans. Since the enzyme exists in the parasite and the host, selective inhibition is a major challenge because essential regions that could be considered molecular targets are highly conserved. Previous biochemical evidence showed that chemical modification of the non-conserved non-catalytic cysteine 222 (C222) inactivates specifically GlTIM. The inactivation correlates with the physicochemical properties of the modifying agent: addition of a non-polar, small chemical group at C222 reduces the enzyme activity by one half, whereas negatively charged, large chemical groups cause full inactivation.</p>

<p>Pyridomycin, a natural product with potent antituberculosis activity, inhibits a major drug target, the InhA enoyl reductase. Here, we unveil the co-crystal structure and unique ability of pyridomycin to block both the NADH cofactor- and lipid substrate-binding pockets of InhA. This is to our knowledge a first-of-a-kind binding mode that discloses a new means of InhA inhibition. Proof-of-principle studies show how structure-assisted drug design can improve the activity of new pyridomycin derivatives. </p>

<p>Prokaryotic glutathione S-transferases are as diverse as their eukaryotic counterparts but are much less well characterized. BphK from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 consumes two GSH molecules to reductively dehalogenate chlorinated 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-2,4-dienoates (HOPDAs), inhibitory polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites. Crystallographic structures of two ternary complexes of BphK were solved to a resolution of 2.1A. In the BphK-GSH-HOPDA complex, GSH and HOPDA molecules occupy the G- and H-subsites, respectively. The thiol nucleophile of the GSH molecule is positioned for SN2 attack at carbon 3 of the bound HOPDA. The respective sulfur atoms of conserved Cys-10 and the bound GSH are within 3.0A, consistent with product release and the formation of a mixed disulfide intermediate. In the BphK-(GSH)2 complex, a GSH molecule occupies each of the two subsites. The three sulfur atoms of the two GSH molecules and Cys-10 are aligned suitably for a disulfide exchange reaction that would regenerate the resting enzyme and yield disulfide-linked GSH molecules. A second conserved residue, His-106, is adjacent to the thiols of Cys-10 and the GSH bound to the G-subsite and thus may stabilize a transition state in the disulfide exchange reaction. Overall, the structures support and elaborate a proposed dehalogenation mechanism for BphK and provide insight into the plasticity of the H-subsite.</p>

<p>UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM) plays an essential role in galactofuranose biosynthesis in microorganisms by catalyzing the conversion of UDP-galactopyranose to UDP-galactofuranose. The enzyme has gained attention recently as a promising target for the design of new antifungal, antitrypanosomal, and antileishmanial agents. Here we report the first crystal structure of UGM complexed with its redox partner NAD(P)H. Kinetic protein crystallography was used to obtain structures of oxidized Aspergillus fumigatus UGM (AfUGM) complexed with NADPH and NADH, as well as reduced AfUGM after dissociation of NADP(+). NAD(P)H binds with the nicotinamide near the FAD isoalloxazine and the ADP moiety extending toward the mobile 200s active site flap. The nicotinamide riboside binding site overlaps that of the substrate galactopyranose moiety, and thus NADPH and substrate binding are mutually exclusive. On the other hand, the pockets for the adenine of NADPH and uracil of the substrate are distinct and separated by only 6 Å, which raises the possibility of designing novel inhibitors that bind both sites. All 12 residues that contact NADP(H) are conserved among eukaryotic UGMs. Residues that form the AMP pocket are absent in bacterial UGMs, which suggests that eukaryotic and bacterial UGMs have different NADP(H) binding sites. The structures address the longstanding question of how UGM binds NAD(P)H and provide new opportunities for drug discovery.</p>

<p>The anticancer activities and SARs of estradiol-17-O-sulfamates and estradiol 3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamates (E2bisMATEs) as steroid sulfatase (STS) inhibitors and antiproliferative agents are discussed. Estradiol 3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamates 20 and 21, in contrast to the 17-O-monosulfamate 11, proved to be excellent STS inhibitors. 2-Substituted E2bisMATEs 21 and 23 additionally exhibited potent antiproliferative activity with mean graph midpoint values of 18-87 nM in the NCI 60-cell-line panel. 21 Exhibited antiangiogenic in vitro and in vivo activity in an early-stage Lewis lung model, and 23 dosed p.o. caused marked growth inhibition in a nude mouse xenograft tumor model. Modeling studies suggest that the E2bisMATEs and 2-MeOE2 share a common mode of binding to tubulin, though COMPARE analysis of activity profiles was negative. 21 was cocrystallized with carbonic anhydrase II, and X-ray crystallography revealed unexpected coordination of the 17-O-sulfamate of 21 to the active site zinc and a probable additional lower affinity binding site. 2-Substituted E2bisMATEs are attractive candidates for further development as multitargeted anticancer agents.</p>

<p>Organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents are potent toxins that inhibit cholinesterases and produce a rapid and lethal cholinergic crisis. Development of protein-based therapeutics is being pursued with the goal of preventing nerve agent toxicity and protecting against the long-term side effects of these agents. The drug-metabolizing enzyme human carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1) is a candidate protein-based therapeutic because of its similarity in structure and function to the cholinesterase targets of nerve agent poisoning. However, the ability of wild-type hCE1 to process the G-type nerve agents sarin and cyclosarin has not been determined. We report the crystal structure of hCE1 in complex with the nerve agent cyclosarin. We further use stereoselective nerve agent analogs to establish that hCE1 exhibits a 1700- and 2900-fold preference for the P(R) enantiomers of analogs of soman and cyclosarin, respectively, and a 5-fold preference for the P(S) isomer of a sarin analog. Finally, we show that for enzyme inhibited by racemic mixtures of bona fide nerve agents, hCE1 spontaneously reactivates in the presence of sarin but not soman or cyclosarin. The addition of the neutral oxime 2,3-butanedione monoxime increases the rate of reactivation of hCE1 from sarin inhibition by more than 60-fold but has no effect on reactivation with the other agents examined. Taken together, these data demonstrate that hCE1 is only reactivated after inhibition with the more toxic P(S) isomer of sarin. These results provide important insights toward the long-term goal of designing novel forms of hCE1 to act as protein-based therapeutics for nerve agent detoxification.</p>

<p>Alpha-glucuronidases cleave the alpha-1,2-glycosidic bond between 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid and short xylooligomers as part of the hemicellulose degradation system. To date, all of the alpha-glucuronidases are classified as family 67 glycosidases, which catalyze the hydrolysis via the investing mechanism. Here we describe several high resolution crystal structures of the alpha-glucuronidase (AguA) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, in complex with its substrate and products. In the complex of AguA with the intact substrate, the 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid sugar ring is distorted into a half-chair conformation, which is closer to the planar conformation required for the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state structure. In the active site, a water molecule is coordinated between two carboxylic acids, in an appropriate position to act as a nucleophile. From the structural data it is likely that two carboxylic acids, Asp(364) and Glu(392), activate together the nucleophilic water molecule. The loop carrying the catalytic general acid Glu(285) cannot be resolved in some of the structures but could be visualized in its "open" and "closed" (catalytic) conformations in other structures. The protonated state of Glu(285) is presumably stabilized by its proximity to the negative charge of the substrate, representing a new variation of substrate-assisted catalysis mechanism.</p>

<p>The key step in the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL) is reversible cleavage of the Cβ-Cγ bond of L-tyrosine. Here, we present X-ray structures for two enzymatic states that form just before and after the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond. As for most other pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes, the first state, a quinonoid intermediate, is central for the catalysis. We captured this relatively unstable intermediate in the crystalline state by introducing substitutions Y71F or F448H in Citrobacter freundii TPL and briefly soaking crystals of the mutant enzymes with a substrate 3-fluoro-L-tyrosine followed by flash-cooling. The X-ray structures, determined at ~2.0 Å resolution, reveal two quinonoid geometries: "relaxed" in the open and "tense" in the closed state of the active site. The "tense" state is characterized by changes in enzyme contacts made with the substrate's phenolic moiety, which result in significantly strained conformation at Cβ and Cγ positions. We also captured, at 2.25 Å resolution, the X-ray structure for the state just after the substrate's Cβ-Cγ bond cleavage by preparing the ternary complex between TPL, alanine quinonoid and pyridine N-oxide, which mimics the α-aminoacrylate intermediate with bound phenol. In this state, the enzyme-ligand contacts remain almost exactly the same as in the "tense" quinonoid, indicating that the strain induced by the closure of the active site facilitates elimination of phenol. Taken together, structural observations demonstrate that the enzyme serves not only to stabilize the transition state but also to destabilize the ground state.</p>

<p>Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) is a flavoprotein with homologues in all domains of life except plants. It plays a physiological role both in sulfide detoxification and in energy transduction. We isolated the protein from native membranes of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, and we determined its X-ray structure in the "as-purified," substrate-bound, and inhibitor-bound forms at resolutions of 2.3, 2.0, and 2.9 A, respectively. The structure is composed of 2 Rossmann domains and 1 attachment domain, with an overall monomeric architecture typical of disulfide oxidoreductase flavoproteins. A. aeolicus SQR is a surprisingly trimeric, periplasmic integral monotopic membrane protein that inserts about 12 A into the lipidic bilayer through an amphipathic helix-turn-helix tripodal motif. The quinone is located in a channel that extends from the si side of the FAD to the membrane. The quinone ring is sandwiched between the conserved amino acids Phe-385 and Ile-346, and it is possibly protonated upon reduction via Glu-318 and/or neighboring water molecules. Sulfide polymerization occurs on the re side of FAD, where the invariant Cys-156 and Cys-347 appear to be covalently bound to polysulfur fragments. The structure suggests that FAD is covalently linked to the polypeptide in an unusual way, via a disulfide bridge between the 8-methyl group and Cys-124. The applicability of this disulfide bridge for transferring electrons from sulfide to FAD, 2 mechanisms for sulfide polymerization and channeling of the substrate, S(2-), and of the product, S(n), in and out of the active site are discussed.</p>

<p>Mistranslation arising from confusion of serine for alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetases (AlaRSs) has profound functional consequences. Throughout evolution, two editing checkpoints prevent disease-causing mistranslation from confusing glycine or serine for alanine at the active site of AlaRS. In both bacteria and mice, Ser poses a bigger challenge than Gly. One checkpoint is the AlaRS editing centre, and the other is from widely distributed AlaXps-free-standing, genome-encoded editing proteins that clear Ser-tRNA(Ala). The paradox of misincorporating both a smaller (glycine) and a larger (serine) amino acid suggests a deep conflict for nature-designed AlaRS. Here we show the chemical basis for this conflict. Nine crystal structures, together with kinetic and mutational analysis, provided snapshots of adenylate formation for each amino acid. An inherent dilemma is posed by constraints of a structural design that pins down the alpha-amino group of the bound amino acid by using an acidic residue. This design, dating back more than 3 billion years, creates a serendipitous interaction with the serine OH that is difficult to avoid. Apparently because no better architecture for the recognition of alanine could be found, the serine misactivation problem was solved through free-standing AlaXps, which appeared contemporaneously with early AlaRSs. The results reveal unconventional problems and solutions arising from the historical design of the protein synthesis machinery.</p>

<p>The MJ0490 gene, one of the only two genes of Methanococcus jannaschii showing sequence similarity to the lactate/malate family of dehydrogenases, was classified initially as coding for a putative l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). It has been re-classified as a malate dehydrogenase (MDH) gene, because it shows significant sequence similarity to MT0188, MDH II from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum strain DeltaH. The three-dimensional structure of its gene product has been determined in two crystal forms: a "dimeric" structure in the orthorhombic crystal at 1.9 A resolution and a "tetrameric" structure in the tetragonal crystal at 2.8 A. These structures share a similar subunit fold with other LDHs and MDHs. The tetrameric structure resembles typical tetrameric LDHs. The dimeric structure is equivalent to the P-dimer of tetrameric LDHs, unlike dimeric MDHs, which correspond to the Q-dimer. The structure reveals that the cofactor NADP(H) is bound at the active site, despite the fact that it was not intentionally added during protein purification and crystallization. The preference of NADP(H) over NAD(H) has been supported by activity assays. The cofactor preference is explained by the presence of a glycine residue in the cofactor binding pocket (Gly33), which replaces a conserved aspartate (or glutamate) residue in other NAD-dependent LDHs or MDHs. Preference for NADP(H) is contributed by hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms of the monophosphate group and the ribose sugar of adenosine in NADP(H) and the side-chains of Ser9, Arg34, His36, and Ser37. The MDH activity of MJ0490 is made possible by Arg86, which is conserved in MDHs but not in LDHs. The enzymatic assay showed that the MJ0490 protein possesses the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-activated LDH activity (reduction). Thus the MJ0490 gene product appears to be a novel member of the lactate/malate dehydrogenase family, displaying an LDH scaffold and exhibiting a relaxed substrate and cofactor specificities in NADP(H) and NAD(H)-dependent malate and lactate dehydrogenase reactions.</p>

<p>Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) is a flavoprotein with homologues in all domains of life except plants. It plays a physiological role both in sulfide detoxification and in energy transduction. We isolated the protein from native membranes of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, and we determined its X-ray structure in the "as-purified," substrate-bound, and inhibitor-bound forms at resolutions of 2.3, 2.0, and 2.9 A, respectively. The structure is composed of 2 Rossmann domains and 1 attachment domain, with an overall monomeric architecture typical of disulfide oxidoreductase flavoproteins. A. aeolicus SQR is a surprisingly trimeric, periplasmic integral monotopic membrane protein that inserts about 12 A into the lipidic bilayer through an amphipathic helix-turn-helix tripodal motif. The quinone is located in a channel that extends from the si side of the FAD to the membrane. The quinone ring is sandwiched between the conserved amino acids Phe-385 and Ile-346, and it is possibly protonated upon reduction via Glu-318 and/or neighboring water molecules. Sulfide polymerization occurs on the re side of FAD, where the invariant Cys-156 and Cys-347 appear to be covalently bound to polysulfur fragments. The structure suggests that FAD is covalently linked to the polypeptide in an unusual way, via a disulfide bridge between the 8-methyl group and Cys-124. The applicability of this disulfide bridge for transferring electrons from sulfide to FAD, 2 mechanisms for sulfide polymerization and channeling of the substrate, S(2-), and of the product, S(n), in and out of the active site are discussed.</p>

<p>Mutations in pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase are known to cause neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. This disorder has no cure or effective treatment and is often fatal. Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the active cofactor form of vitamin B(6) required by more than 140 different catalytic activities, including enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. Our aim is to elucidate the mechanism by which a homozygous missense mutation (R229W) in the oxidase, linked to neonatal epileptic encephalopathy, leads to reduced oxidase activity. The R229W variant is approximately 850-fold less efficient than the wild-type enzyme due to an approximately 192-fold decrease in pyridoxine 5'-phosphate affinity and an approximately 4.5-fold decrease in catalytic activity. There is also an approximately 50-fold reduction in the affinity of the R229W variant for the FMN cofactor. A 2.5 A crystal structure of the R229W variant shows that the substitution of Arg-229 at the FMN binding site has led to a loss of hydrogen-bond and/or salt-bridge interactions between FMN and Arg-229 and Ser-175. Additionally, the mutation has led to an alteration of the configuration of a beta-strand-loop-beta-strand structure at the active site, resulting in loss of two critical hydrogen-bond interactions involving residues His-227 and Arg-225, which are important for substrate binding and orientation for catalysis. These results provide a molecular basis for the phenotype associated with the R229W mutation, as well as providing a foundation for understanding the pathophysiological consequences of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase mutations.</p>

<p>Some bacterial type II fatty-acid synthesis (FAS II) enzymes have been shown to be important candidates for drug discovery. The scientific and medical quest for new FAS II protein targets continues to stimulate research in this field. One of the possible additional candidates is the acyl-carrier-protein synthase (AcpS) enzyme. Its holo form post-translationally modifies the apo form of an acyl carrier protein (ACP), which assures the constant delivery of thioester intermediates to the discrete enzymes of FAS II. At the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases (CSGID), AcpSs from Staphylococcus aureus (AcpS(SA)), Vibrio cholerae (AcpS(VC)) and Bacillus anthracis (AcpS(BA)) have been structurally characterized in their apo, holo and product-bound forms, respectively. The structure of AcpS(BA) is emphasized because of the two 3',5'-adenosine diphosphate (3',5'-ADP) product molecules that are found in each of the three coenzyme A (CoA) binding sites of the trimeric protein. One 3',5'-ADP is bound as the 3',5'-ADP part of CoA in the known structures of the CoA-AcpS and 3',5'-ADP-AcpS binary complexes. The position of the second 3',5'-ADP has never been described before. It is in close proximity to the first 3',5'-ADP and the ACP-binding site. The coordination of two ADPs in AcpS(BA) may possibly be exploited for the design of AcpS inhibitors that can block binding of both CoA and ACP.</p>

<p>Integration of the reverse-transcribed HIV cDNA into the host DNA is a required step in viral replication. The virus-encoded integrase protein catalyzes the initial DNA breaking and joining reactions that mediate cDNA integration. Here, the identification by X-ray crystallography of a small-molecule binding site on the integrase catalytic domain is reported. The small-molecule family studied consists of a core of arsenic or phosphorus surrounded by four aromatic groups. Two arsenic derivatives were visualized bound to integrase. In each case, two molecules bound at symmetry-related sites on the catalytic domain dimer interface. The first compound studied, tetraphenyl arsonium, did not inhibit integrase. However, a synthetic compound substituting a catechol for one of the phenyl rings, dihydroxyphenyltriphenylarsonium, bound to the same site and did inhibit the enzyme. Changes in the vicinity of the catalytic site were seen with the inhibitory compound only, potentially explaining its mechanism of action. Further substituting phosphonium for arsonium yielded a compound with an IC(50) in the low micromolar range. These findings may be useful in designing new inhibitors of integrase, which is at present the only one of the three HIV enzymes for which clinically useful inhibitors are not available.</p>

<p>After the disappointment of clinical trials with early broad spectrum synthetic inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the field is now resurging with a new focus on the development of selective inhibitors that fully discriminate between different members of the MMP family with several therapeutic applications in perspective. Here, we report a novel class of highly selective MMP-12 inhibitors, without a phosphinic zinc-binding group, designed to plunge deeper into the S(1)' cavity of the enzyme. The best inhibitor from this series, identified through a systematic chemical exploration, displays nanomolar potency toward MMP-12 and selectivity factors that range between 2 and 4 orders of magnitude toward a large set of MMPs. Comparison of the high resolution x-ray structures of MMP-12 in free state or bound to this new MMP-12 selective inhibitor reveals that this compound fits deeply within the S(1)' specificity cavity, maximizing surface/volume ratios, without perturbing the S(1)' loop conformation. This is in contrast with highly selective MMP-13 inhibitors that were shown to select a particular S(1)' loop conformation. The search for such compounds that fit precisely to preponderant S(1)' loop conformation of a particular MMP may prove to be an alternative effective strategy for developing selective inhibitors of MMPs.</p>

<p>A bacterial response to the clinical use of class A beta-lactamase inhibitors such as tazobactam and clavulanic acid is the expression of variant beta-lactamases with weaker binding affinities for these mechanism-based inhibitors. Some of these inhibitor-resistant variants contain a glycine mutation at Ser130, a conserved active site residue known to be adventitiously involved in the inhibition mechanism. The crystallographic structure of a complex of tazobactam with the Ser130Gly variant of the class A SHV-1 beta-lactamase has been determined to 1.8 A resolution. Two reaction intermediates are observed. The primary intermediate is an acyclic species bound to the reactive Ser70. It is poorly primed for catalytic hydrolysis because its ester carbonyl group is completely displaced from the enzyme's oxyanion hole. A smaller fraction of the enzyme contains a Ser70-bound aldehyde resulting from hydrolytic loss of the triazoyl-sulfinyl amino acid moiety from the primary species. This first structure of a class A beta-lactamase lacking Ser130, the side chain of which functions in beta-lactam binding and possibly in catalysis, gives crystallographic evidence that the acylation step of beta-lactam turnover can occur without Ser130. Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of the uncomplexed Ser130Gly enzyme, also determined to 1.8 A resolution, shows that a critical Glu166-activated water molecule is missing from the catalytic site. Comparison of this uncomplexed variant with the wild-type structure reveals that Ser130 is required for orienting the side chain of Ser70 and ensuring the hydrogen bonding of Ser70 to both Lys73 and the catalytic water molecule.</p>

<p>The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is incapable of synthesizing purine nucleotides de novo and relies completely on purines salvaged from the host cells. Adenosine is the preferred precursor and is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase (AK), the most active enzyme in adenosine metabolism in T. gondii. AK thus represents a potential chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of T. gondii infections. The previously solved structures of unliganded AK and AK in complex with adenosine (or 7-iodotubercidin) and an ATP analog revealed a novel catalytic mechanism. A domain closure triggered by a GG switch upon adenosine binding sequesters the adenosine and gamma-phosphate of ATP from the solvent. The formation of the anion hole induced by the ATP binding completes the structural requirements for catalysis. In the current study, the structure of a binary complex of AK and the non-hydrolysable ATP analog AMP-PCP was determined to 1.1 angstroms resolution. The overall structure is similar to the apoenzyme, with an open conformation. AMP-PCP is bound in two relaxed conformations and without anchoring by Arg136. The induced anion hole is the same as that in the ternary complex AK-adenosine-AMP-PCP. This structure provides direct evidence that ATP binding at millimolar concentrations does not require adenosine binding as a prerequisite.</p>

<p>The structures of 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) complexed with substrate (5-aminolaevulinic acid) and three inhibitors: laevulinic acid, succinylacetone and 4-keto-5-aminolaevulinic acid, have been solved at high resolution. The ligands all bind by forming a covalent link with Lys263 at the active site. The structures define the interactions made by one of the two substrate moieties that bind to the enzyme during catalysis. All of the inhibitors induce a significant ordering of the flap covering the active site. Succinylacetone appears to be unique by inducing a number of conformational changes in loops covering the active site, which may be important for understanding the co-operative properties of ALAD enzymes. Succinylacetone is produced in large amounts by patients suffering from the hereditary disease type I tyrosinaemia and its potent inhibition of ALAD also has implications for the pathology of this disease. The most intriguing result is that obtained with 4-keto-5-amino-hexanoic acid, which seems to form a stable carbinolamine intermediate with Lys263. It appears that we have defined the structure of an intermediate of Schiff base formation that the substrate forms upon binding to the P-site of the enzyme.</p>

<p>The specificity of ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) toward their four substrates is governed by the binding of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to the allosteric specificity site. Similar patterns in the kinetics of allosteric regulation have been a strong argument for a common evolutionary origin of the three otherwise widely divergent RNR classes. Recent structural information settled the case for divergent evolution; however, the structural basis for transmission of the allosteric signal is currently poorly understood. A comparative study of the conformational effects of the binding of different effectors has not yet been possible; in addition, only one RNR class has been studied.</p>

<p>L-pyrrolysine, the 22(nd) genetically encoded amino acid, was previously deduced to be (4R, 5R)-4-substituted-pyrroline-5-carboxylate attached to the epsilon-nitrogen of lysine based on the crystal structure of the M. barkeri monomethylamine methyltransferase (MtmB). To confirm L-pyrrolysine's identity, structures of MtmB have been determined following treatment with hydroxylamine, N-methylhydroxylamine, or dithionite. Analysis of these structures has provided additional support for the presence of the pyrroline ring and, together with previous mass spectroscopy data, has led us to assign the C(4)-substituent to a methyl group. Based on this assignment, synthetic L-pyrrolysine was prepared by chemical methods. Detailed study of this chemically synthesized L-pyrrolysine has allowed us to characterize its physical properties, to study its chemical stability, and to elucidate the role of its C(4) substituent. Future applications of this synthetic L-pyrrolysine include its in vivo incorporation into recombinant proteins.</p>

<p>Variants of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) with amino acid replacements at residues in contact with water molecules in the active-site cavity have provided insights into the proton transfer rates in this protein environment. X-ray crystallography and (18)O exchange measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry have been used to investigate structural and catalytic properties of variants of HCA II containing replacements of Tyr7 with Phe (Y7F) and Asn67 with Gln (N67Q). The rate constants for transfer of a proton from His64 to the zinc-bound hydroxide during catalysis were 4 and 9 μs(-1) for Y7F and Y7F/N67Q, respectively, compared with a value of 0.8 μs(-1) for wild-type HCA II. These higher values observed for Y7F and Y7F/N67Q HCA II could not be explained by differences in the values of the pK(a) of the proton donor (His64) and acceptor (zinc-bound hydroxide) or by the orientation of the side chain of the proton shuttle residue His64. They appeared to be associated with a reduced level of branching in the networks of hydrogen-bonded water molecules between proton shuttle residue His64 and the zinc-bound solvent molecule as observed in crystal structures at 1.5-1.6 Å resolution. Moreover, Y7F/N67Q HCA II is unique among the variants studied in having a direct, hydrogen-bonded chain of water molecules between the zinc-bound solvent and N(ε) of His64. This study provides the clearest example to date of the relevance of ordered water structure to rate constants for proton transfer in catalysis by carbonic anhydrase.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of D-lactate dehydrogenase from Aquifex aeolicus (aq_727) was determined to 2.12 A resolution in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 90.94, b = 94.43, c = 188.85 A. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coenzyme-binding domain of Lactobacillus helveticus D-lactate dehydrogenase and contained two homodimers in the asymmetric unit. Each subunit of the homodimer was found to be in a ;closed' conformation with the NADH cofactor bound to the coenzyme-binding domain and with a lactate (or pyruvate) molecule bound at the interdomain active-site cleft.</p>

<p>The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of HIV-1 protease inhibitors incorporating stereochemically defined fused tricyclic P2 ligands are described. Various substituent effects were investigated to maximize the ligand-binding site interactions in the protease active site. Inhibitors 16a and 16f showed excellent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activity, although the incorporation of sulfone functionality resulted in a decrease in potency. Both inhibitors 16a and 16f maintained activity against a panel of multidrug resistant HIV-1 variants. A high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of 16a-bound HIV-1 protease revealed important molecular insights into the ligand-binding site interactions, which may account for the inhibitor's potent antiviral activity and excellent resistance profiles. </p>

<p>The X-ray crystal structure of recombinant epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS), a sesquiterpene cyclase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), has been determined at 1.60 A resolution. Specifically, the structure of wild-type EIZS is that of its closed conformation in complex with three Mg(2+) ions, inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)), and the benzyltriethylammonium cation (BTAC). Additionally, the structure of D99N EIZS has been determined in an open, ligand-free conformation at 1.90 A resolution. Comparison of these two structures provides the first view of conformational changes required for substrate binding and catalysis in a bacterial terpenoid cyclase. Moreover, the binding interactions of BTAC may mimic those of a carbocation intermediate in catalysis. Accordingly, the aromatic rings of F95, F96, and F198 appear to be well-oriented to stabilize carbocation intermediates in the cyclization cascade through cation-pi interactions. Mutagenesis of aromatic residues in the enzyme active site results in the production of alternative sesquiterpene product arrays due to altered modes of stabilization of carbocation intermediates as well as altered templates for the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate. Accordingly, the 1.64 A resolution crystal structure of F198A EIZS in a complex with three Mg(2+) ions, PP(i), and BTAC reveals an alternative binding orientation of BTAC; alternative binding orientations of a carbocation intermediate could lead to the formation of alternative products. Finally, the crystal structure of wild-type EIZS in a complex with four Hg(2+) ions has been determined at 1.90 A resolution, showing that metal binding triggers a significant conformational change of helix G to cap the active site.</p>

<p>The structure of TM1254, a putative beta-phosphoglucomutase from T. maritima, was determined to 1.74 A resolution in a high-throughput structural genomics programme. Diffraction data were obtained from crystals belonging to space group P22(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 48.16, b = 66.70, c = 83.80 A, and were refined to an R factor of 19.2%. The asymmetric unit contained one protein molecule which is comprised of two domains. Structural homologues were found from protein databases that confirmed a strong resemblance between TM1254 and members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) hydrolase family.</p>

<p>ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferases (ACAs) catalyze the transfer of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety from ATP to the upper axial ligand position of cobalamin in the synthesis of coenzyme B 12. For the ACA-catalyzed reaction to proceed, cob(II)alamin must be reduced to cob(I)alamin in the enzyme active site. This reduction is facilitated through the generation of a four-coordinate cob(II)alamin intermediate on the enzyme. We have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of a human-type ACA from Lactobacillus reuteri with a four-coordinate cob(II)alamin bound in the enzyme active site and with the product, adenosylcobalamin, partially occupied in the active site. The assembled structures represent snapshots of the steps in the ACA-catalyzed formation of the cobalt-carbon bond of coenzyme B 12. The structures define the corrinoid binding site and provide visual evidence for a base-off, four-coordinate cob(II)alamin intermediate. The complete structural description of ACA-mediated catalysis reveals the molecular features of four-coordinate cob(II)alamin stabilization and provides additional insights into the molecular basis for dysfunction in human patients suffering from methylmalonic aciduria.</p>

<p>Chloroperoxidase (CPO) is a heme-thiolate enzyme that catalyzes hydrogen peroxide-dependent halogenation reactions. Structural data on substrate binding have not been available so far. CPO was therefore crystallized in the presence of iodide or bromide. One halide binding site was identified at the surface near a narrow channel that connects the surface with the heme. Two other halide binding sites were identified within and at the other end of this channel. Together, these sites suggest a pathway for access of halide anions to the active site. The structure of CPO complexed with its natural substrate cyclopentanedione was determined at a resolution of 1.8 A. This is the first example of a CPO structure with a bound organic substrate. In addition, structures of CPO bound with nitrate, acetate, and formate and of a ternary complex with dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and cyanide were determined. These structures have implications for the mechanism of compound I formation. Before binding to the heme, the incoming hydrogen peroxide first interacts with Glu-183. The deprotonated Glu-183 abstracts a proton from hydrogen peroxide. The hydroperoxo-anion then binds at the heme, yielding compound 0. Glu-183 protonates the distal oxygen of compound 0, water is released, and compound I is formed.</p>

<p>Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) is involved in the regulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by metabolizing the free endogenous arginine derivatives N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine (MMA) and N(omega),N(omega)-dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA), which are competitive inhibitors of NOS. Here, we present high-resolution crystal structures of DDAH isoform 1 (DDAH-1) isolated from bovine brain in complex with different inhibitors, including S-nitroso-L-homocysteine and Zn2+, a regulator of this mammalian enzyme. The structure of DDAH-1 consists of a propeller-like fold similar to other arginine-modifying enzymes and a flexible loop, which adopts different conformations and acts as a lid at the entrance of the active site. The orientation and interaction mode of inhibitors in the active site give insight into the regulation and the molecular mechanism of the enzyme. The presented structures provide a basis for the structure-based development of specific DDAH-1 inhibitors that might be useful in the therapeutic treatment of NOS dysfunction-related diseases.</p>

<p>Non-nucleoside inhibitors of HCV NS5b RNA polymerase were discovered by a fragment-based lead discovery approach, beginning with crystallographic fragment screening. The NS5b binding affinity and biochemical activity of fragment hits and inhibitors was determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) and an enzyme inhibition assay, respectively. Crystallographic fragment screening hits with approximately 1-10mM binding affinity (K(D)) were iteratively optimized to give leads with approximately 200nM biochemical activity and low microM cellular activity in a Replicon assay.</p>

<p>Ferritins are a family of proteins distributed widely in nature. In bacterial, plant, and animal cells, ferritin appears to serve as a soluble, bioavailable, and non-toxic form of iron provider. Ferritins from animal sources are heteropolymers composed of two types of subunit, H and L, which differ mainly by the presence (H) or absence (L) of active ferroxidase centres. We report the crystallographic structures of four human H apoferritin variants at a resolution of up to 1.5 Angstrom. Crystal derivatives using Zn(II) as redox-stable alternative for Fe(II), allows us to characterize the different metal-binding sites. The ferroxidase centre, which is composed of sites A and B, binds metal with a preference for the A site. In addition, distinct Zn(II)-binding sites were found in the 3-fold axes, 4-fold axes and on the cavity surface near the ferroxidase centre. To study the importance of the distance of the two metal atoms in the ferroxidase centre, single and double replacement of glutamate 27 (site A) and glutamate 107 (site B), the two axial ligands, by aspartate residues have been carried out. The consequences for metal binding and the correlation with Fe(II) oxidation rates are discussed.</p>

<p>Peroxiredoxin IV (PrxIV) is an endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzyme that metabolizes the hydrogen peroxide produced by endoplasmic reticulum oxidase 1 (Ero1). It has been shown to play a role in de novo disulfide formation, oxidizing members of the protein disulfide isomerase family of enzymes, and is a member of the typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin family. We have determined the crystal structure of both reduced and disulfide-bonded, as well as a resolving cysteine mutant of human PrxIV. We show that PrxIV has a similar structure to other typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins and undergoes a conformational change from a fully folded to a locally unfolded form following the formation of a disulfide between the peroxidatic and resolving cysteine residues. Unlike other mammalian typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, we show that human PrxIV forms a stable decameric structure even in its disulfide-bonded state. In addition, the structure of a resolving cysteine mutant reveals an intermediate in the reaction cycle that adopts the locally unfolded conformation. Interestingly the peroxidatic cysteine in the crystal structure is sulfenylated rather than sulfinylated or sulfonylated. In addition, the peroxidatic cysteine in the resolving cysteine mutant is resistant to hyper-oxidation following incubation with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. These results highlight some unique properties of PrxIV and suggest that the equilibrium between the fully folded and locally unfolded forms favors the locally unfolded conformation upon sulfenylation of the peroxidatic cysteine residue.</p>

<p>The homotrimeric human serine protease HtrA1 is homologous to bacterial HtrA proteases regarding the trypsin-like catalytic and PDZ domains but differs by the presence of an N-terminal domain with IGFBP and Kazal homology. The crystal structures and SAXS analysis presented herein reveal the rare tandem of IGFBP- and Kazal-like modules, a protease active site that adopts a competent conformation in the absence of substrate or inhibitor and a model for the intact protein in solution. Highly sensitive enzymatic assays and binding studies demonstrate that the N-terminal tandem has no apparent effect on protease activity, and in accordance with the structure-based predictions, neither the IGFBP- nor Kazal-like module retains the function of their prototype proteins. Our structures of the unliganded HtrA1 active site suggest two-state equilibrium and a "conformational selection" model, in which substrate binds to the active conformer.</p>

<p>1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme catalyzing the opening of the cyclopropane ring of ACC to give alpha-ketobutyric acid and ammonia as the products. This ring cleavage reaction is unusual because the substrate, ACC, contains no abstractable alpha-proton and the carboxyl group is retained in the product. How the reaction is initiated to generate an alpha-carbanionic intermediate, which is the common entry for most PLP-dependent reactions, is not obvious. To gain insight into this unusual ring-opening reaction, we have solved the crystal structures of ACC deaminase from Pseudomonas sp. ACP in complex with substrate ACC, an inhibitor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-phosphonate (ACP), the product alpha-ketobutyrate, and two d-amino acids. Several notable observations of these structural studies include the following: (1) a typically elusive gem-diamine intermediate is trapped in the enzyme complex with ACC or ACP; (2) Tyr294 is in close proximity (3.0 A) to the pro-S methylene carbon of ACC in the gem-diamine complexes, implicating a direct role of this residue in the ring-opening reaction; (3) Tyr294 may also be responsible for the abstraction of the alpha-proton from d-amino acids, a prelude to the subsequent deamination reaction; (4) the steric hindrance precludes accessibility of active site functional groups to the l-amino acid substrates and may account for the stereospecificity of this enzyme toward d-amino acids. These structural data provide evidence favoring a mechanism in which the ring cleavage is induced by a nucleophilic attack at the pro-S beta-methylene carbon of ACC, with Tyr294 as the nucleophile. However, these observations are also consistent with an alternative mechanistic possibility in which the ring opening is acid-catalyzed and may be facilitated by charge relay through PLP, where Tyr294 functions as a general acid. The results of mutagenesis studies corroborated the assigned critical role for Tyr294 in the catalysis.</p>

<p>The enzyme norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes the stereospecific Pictet-Spengler cyclization between dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, the key step in the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. The crystallographic structure of norcoclaurine synthase from Thalictrum flavum in its complex with dopamine substrate and the nonreactive substrate analogue 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde has been solved at 2.1A resolution. NCS shares no common features with the functionally correlated "Pictet-Spenglerases" that catalyze the first step of the indole alkaloids pathways and conforms to the overall fold of the Bet v1-like protein. The active site of NCS is located within a 20-A-long catalytic tunnel and is shaped by the side chains of a tyrosine, a lysine, an aspartic, and a glutamic acid. The geometry of the amino acid side chains with respect to the substrates reveals the structural determinants that govern the mechanism of the stereoselective Pictet-Spengler cyclization, thus establishing an excellent foundation for the understanding of the finer details of the catalytic process. Site-directed mutations of the relevant residues confirm the assignment based on crystallographic findings.</p>

<p>Bcps constitute a group of antioxidant enzymes, belonging to the Prx family, that are widely distributed in bacteria, plants, and fungi. These proteins can contain two conserved cysteines within the CXXXXC motif. Recent studies demonstrated that though the role of the first cysteine is well defined, being the catalytic peroxidatic cysteine in all the members of this protein family, data on the function of the second cysteine are controversial and require further investigation. In this article, we report on the functional and structural characterization of Bcp1, an archaeal Bcp isolated from Sulfolobus solfataricus, which presents two conserved cysteine residues at positions 45 and 50. Functional studies revealed that this enzyme performs the catalytic reaction using an atypical 2-Cys mechanism, where Cys45 is the peroxidatic and Cys50 is the resolving cysteine. The X-ray structure of the double mutant C45S/C50S, representative of the fully reduced enzyme state, was determined at a resolution of 2.15 A, showing a Trx fold similar to that of other Prxs. Superposition with a structural homologue in the oxidized state provided, for the first time, a detailed description of the structural rearrangement necessary for a member of the Bcp family to perform the catalytic reaction. From this structural analysis, it emerges that a significant conformational change from a fully folded, to a locally unfolded form is required to form the intramolecular disulfide bond upon oxidation, according to the proposed reaction mechanism. Two residues, namely Arg53 and Asp54, which could play a role in this rearrangement, were also identified.</p>

<p>A family of 4-heteroaryl-2-amino-pyrimidine CDK2 inhibitor lead compounds was discovered with the new database-mining program LIDAEUS through in silico screening. Four compounds with IC(50) values ranging from 17 to 0.9 microM were selected for X-ray crystal analysis. Two distinct binding modes are observed, one of which resembles the hydrogen bonding pattern of bound ATP. In the second binding mode, the ligands trigger a conformational change in the activation T loop by inducing movement of Lys(33) and Asp(145) side chains. The family of molecules discovered provides an excellent starting point for the design and synthesis of tight binding inhibitors, which may lead to a new class of antiproliferative drugs.</p>

<p>N(2)-(2-Carboxyethyl)arginine synthase (CEAS), an unusual thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme, catalyses the committed step in the biosynthesis of the b-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid in Streptomyces clavuligerus. Crystal structures of tetrameric CEAS-ThDP in complex with the substrate analogues 5-guanidinovaleric acid (GVA) and tartrate, and a structure reflecting a possible enol(ate)-ThDP reaction intermediate are described. The structures suggest overlapping binding sites for the substrates D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (D-G3P) and L-arginine, and are consistent with the proposed CEAS mechanism in which D-G3P binds at the active site and reacts to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated intermediate,which subsequently undergoes (1,4)-Michael addition with the alpha-amino group of L-arginine. Additional solution studies are presented which probe the amino acid substrate tolerance of CEAS, providing further insight into the L-arginine binding site. These findings may facilitate the engineering of CEAS towards the synthesis of alternative beta-amino acid products.</p>

<p>Acyl carrier protein represents one of the most highly conserved proteins across all domains of life and is nature's way of transporting hydrocarbon chains in vivo. Notably, type II acyl carrier proteins serve as a crucial interaction hub in primary cellular metabolism by communicating transiently between partner enzymes of the numerous biosynthetic pathways. However, the highly transient nature of such interactions and the inherent conformational mobility of acyl carrier protein have stymied previous attempts to visualize structurally acyl carrier protein tied to an overall catalytic cycle. This is essential to understanding a fundamental aspect of cellular metabolism leading to compounds that are not only useful to the cell, but also of therapeutic value. For example, acyl carrier protein is central to the biosynthesis of the lipid A (endotoxin) component of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative microorganisms, which is required for their growth and survival, and is an activator of the mammalian host's immune system, thus emerging as an important therapeutic target. During lipid A synthesis (Raetz pathway), acyl carrier protein shuttles acyl intermediates linked to its prosthetic 4'-phosphopantetheine group among four acyltransferases, including LpxD. Here we report the crystal structures of three forms of Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein engaging LpxD, which represent stalled substrate and liberated products along the reaction coordinate. The structures show the intricate interactions at the interface that optimally position acyl carrier protein for acyl delivery and that directly involve the pantetheinyl group. Conformational differences among the stalled acyl carrier proteins provide the molecular basis for the association-dissociation process. An unanticipated conformational shift of 4'-phosphopantetheine groups within the LpxD catalytic chamber shows an unprecedented role of acyl carrier protein in product release. </p>

<p>Superfamily ATPases in type IV pili, type 2 secretion, and archaella (formerly archaeal flagella) employ similar sequences for distinct biological processes. Here, we structurally and functionally characterize prototypical superfamily ATPase FlaI in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, showing FlaI activities in archaeal swimming-organelle assembly and movement. X-ray scattering data of FlaI in solution and crystal structures with and without nucleotide reveal a hexameric crown assembly with key cross-subunit interactions. Rigid building blocks form between N-terminal domains (points) and neighboring subunit C-terminal domains (crown ring). Upon nucleotide binding, these six cross-subunit blocks move with respect to each other and distinctly from secretion and pilus ATPases. Crown interactions and conformations regulate assembly, motility, and force direction via a basic-clamp switching mechanism driving conformational changes between stable, backbone-interconnected moving blocks. Collective structural and mutational results identify in vivo functional components for assembly and motility, phosphate-triggered rearrangements by ATP hydrolysis, and molecular predictors for distinct ATPase superfamily functions.</p>

<p>N(2)-(2-Carboxyethyl)arginine synthase (CEAS), an unusual thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme, catalyses the committed step in the biosynthesis of the b-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid in Streptomyces clavuligerus.

<p>The metal-dependent deacetylase LpxC catalyzes the first committed step of lipid A biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria. Accordingly, LpxC is an attractive target for the development of inhibitors that may serve as potential new antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Here, we report the 2.7 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of LpxC complexed with the substrate analogue inhibitor TU-514 and the 2.0 A resolution structure of LpxC complexed with imidazole. The X-ray crystal structure of LpxC complexed with TU-514 allows for a detailed examination of the coordination geometry of the catalytic zinc ion and other enzyme-inhibitor interactions in the active site. The hydroxamate group of TU-514 forms a bidentate chelate complex with the zinc ion and makes hydrogen bond interactions with conserved active site residues E78, H265, and T191. The inhibitor C-4 hydroxyl group makes direct hydrogen bond interactions with E197 and H58. Finally, the C-3 myristate moiety of the inhibitor binds in the hydrophobic tunnel of the active site. These intermolecular interactions provide a foundation for understanding structural aspects of enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor affinity. Comparison of the TU-514 complex with cacodylate and imidazole complexes suggests a possible substrate diphosphate binding site and highlights residues that may stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate and its flanking transition states in catalysis. Evidence of a catalytic zinc ion in the native zinc enzyme coordinated by H79, H238, D242, and two water molecules with square pyramidal geometry is also presented. These results suggest that the native state of this metallohydrolase may contain a pentacoordinate zinc ion, which contrasts with the native states of archetypical zinc hydrolases such as thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A.</p>

<p>Octahaem cytochrome c nitrite reductase from Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens (TvNiR), like the previously characterized pentahaem nitrite reductases (NrfAs), catalyzes the six-electron reductions of nitrite to ammonia and of sulfite to sulfide. The active site of both TvNiR and NrfAs is formed by the lysine-coordinated haem and His, Tyr and Arg residues. The distinguishing structural feature of TvNiR is the presence of a covalent bond between the CE2 atom of the catalytic Tyr303 and the S atom of Cys305, which might be responsible for the higher nitrite reductase activity of TvNiR compared with NrfAs. In the present study, a new modified form of the enzyme (TvNiRb) that contains an additional covalent bond between Tyr303 CE1 and Gln360 CG is reported. Structures of TvNiRb in complexes with phosphate (1.45 Å resolution) and sulfite (1.8 Å resolution), the structure of TvNiR in a complex with nitrite (1.83 Å resolution) and several additional structures were determined. The formation of the second covalent bond by Tyr303 leads to a decrease in both the nitrite and sulfite reductase activities of the enzyme. Tyr303 is located at the exit from the putative proton-transport channel to the active site, which is absent in NrfAs. This is an additional argument in favour of the involvement of Tyr303 as a proton donor in catalysis. The changes in the activity of cytochrome c nitrite reductases owing to the formation of Tyr-Cys and Tyr-Gln bonds may be associated with changes in the pK(a) value of the catalytic tyrosine.</p>

<p>Glutamate carboxypeptidase III (GCPIII) is a metalloenzyme that belongs to the transferrin receptor/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII; EC 3.4.17.21) superfamily. GCPIII has been studied mainly because of its evolutionary relationship to GCPII, an enzyme involved in a variety of neuropathologies and malignancies, such as glutamatergic neurotoxicity and prostate cancer. Given the potential functional and pharmacological overlap between GCPIII and GCPII, studies addressing the structural and physiological properties of GCPIII are crucial for obtaining a deeper understanding of the GCPII/GCPIII system. In the present study, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the human GCPIII ectodomain in a 'pseudo-unliganded' state and in a complex with: (a) L-glutamate (a product of hydrolysis); (b) a phosphapeptide transition state mimetic, namely (2S,3'S)-{[(3'-amino-3'-carboxy-propyl)-hydroxyphosphinoyl]methyl}-pentanedioic acid; and (c) quisqualic acid, a glutamate biostere. Our data reveal the overall fold and quaternary arrangement of the GCPIII molecule, define the architecture of the GCPIII substrate-binding cavity, and offer an experimental evidence for the presence of Zn(2+) ions in the bimetallic active site. Furthermore, the structures allow us to detail interactions between the enzyme and its ligands and to characterize the functional flexibility of GCPIII, which is essential for substrate recognition. A comparison of these GCPIII structures with the equivalent GCPII complexes reveals differences in the organization of specificity pockets, in surface charge distribution, and in the occupancy of the co-catalytic zinc sites. The data presented here provide information that should prove to be essential for the structurally-aided design of GCPIII-specific inhibitors and might comprise guidelines for future comparative GCPII/GCPIII studies.</p>

<p>Beta-lactamases confer bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins. The characteristic class C beta-lactamase AmpC catalyzes the reaction with several key residues including Ser64, Tyr150, and Lys67. Here, we describe a 1.07 A X-ray crystallographic structure of AmpC beta-lactamase in complex with a boronic acid deacylation transition-state analogue. The high quality of the electron density map allows the determination of many proton positions. The proton on the Tyr150 hydroxyl group is clearly visible and is donated to the boronic oxygen mimicking the deacylation water. Meanwhile, Lys67 hydrogen bonds with Ser64Ogamma, Asn152Odelta1, and the backbone oxygen of Ala220. This suggests that this residue is positively charged and has relinquished the hydrogen bond with Tyr150 observed in acyl-enzyme complex structures. Together with previous biochemical and NMR studies, these observations indicate that Tyr150 is protonated throughout the reaction coordinate, disfavoring mechanisms that involve a stable tyrosinate as the general base for deacylation. Rather, the hydroxyl of Tyr150 appears to be well positioned to electrostatically stabilize the negative charge buildup in the tetrahedral high-energy intermediate. This structure, in itself, appears consistent with a mechanism involving either Tyr150 acting as a transient catalytic base in conjunction with a neutral Lys67 or the lactam nitrogen as the general base. Whereas mutagenesis studies suggest that Lys67 may be replaced by an arginine, disfavoring the conjugate base mechanism, distinguishing between these two hypotheses may ultimately depend on direct determination of the pK(a) of Lys67 along the reaction coordinate.</p>

<p>Kinetic and structural data are presented on the interaction with Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE) of (+)-huperzine A, a synthetic enantiomer of the anti-Alzheimer drug, (-)-huperzine A, and of its natural homologue (-)-huperzine B. (+)-Huperzine A and (-)-huperzine B bind to the enzyme with dissociation constants of 4.30 and 0.33 microM, respectively, compared to 0.18 microM for (-)-huperzine A. The X-ray structures of the complexes of (+)-huperzine A and (-)-huperzine B with TcAChE were determined to 2.1 and 2.35 A resolution, respectively, and compared to the previously determined structure of the (-)-huperzine A complex. All three interact with the "anionic" subsite of the active site, primarily through pi-pi stacking and through van der Waals or C-H.pi interactions with Trp84 and Phe330. Since their alpha-pyridone moieties are responsible for their key interactions with the active site via hydrogen bonding, and possibly via C-H.pi interactions, all three maintain similar positions and orientations with respect to it. The carbonyl oxygens of all three appear to repel the carbonyl oxygen of Gly117, thus causing the peptide bond between Gly117 and Gly118 to undergo a peptide flip. As a consequence, the position of the main chain nitrogen of Gly118 in the "oxyanion" hole in the native enzyme becomes occupied by the carbonyl of Gly117. Furthermore, the flipped conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of Gly117O to Gly119N and Ala201N, the other two functional elements of the three-pronged "oxyanion hole" characteristic of cholinesterases. All three inhibitors thus would be expected to abolish hydrolysis of all ester substrates, whether charged or neutral.</p>

<p>The analysis of the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus genome revealed the first virus-encoded nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), an enzyme that is central to the synthesis of RNA and DNA, ubiquitous in cellular organisms, and well conserved among the three domains of life. In contrast with the broad specificity of cellular NDKs for all types of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides, the mimivirus enzyme exhibits a strongly preferential affinity for deoxypyrimidines. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of this unique substrate specificity, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus NDK alone and in complex with various nucleotides. As predicted from a sequence comparison with cellular NDKs, the 3D structure of the mimivirus enzyme exhibits a shorter Kpn loop, previously recognized as a main feature of the NDK active site. The structure of the viral enzyme in complex with various nucleotides also pinpointed two residue changes, both located near the active site and specific to the viral NDK, which could explain its stronger affinity for deoxynucleotides and pyrimidine nucleotides. The role of these residues was explored by building a set of viral NDK variants, assaying their enzymatic activities, and determining their 3D structures in complex with various nucleotides. A total of 26 crystallographic structures were determined at resolutions ranging from 2.8 A to 1.5 A. Our results suggest that the mimivirus enzyme progressively evolved from an ancestral NDK under the constraints of optimizing its efficiency for the replication of an AT-rich (73%) viral genome in a thymidine-limited host environment.</p>

<p>Water is ubiquitously present in any biological system and has therefore to be regarded as an additional binding partner in the protein-ligand binding process. Upon complex formation, a new solvent-exposed surface is generated and water molecules from the first solvation layer will arrange around this newly formed surface. So far, the influence of such water arrangements on the ligand binding properties is unknown. In this study, the binding modes of nine congeneric phosphonamidate-type inhibitors with systematically varied, size-increasing hydrophobic P2 ' substituents (from methyl to phenylethyl) addressing the hydrophobic, solvent-exposed S2 ' pocket of thermolysin were analyzed by high-resolution crystal structures and correlated with their thermodynamic binding profiles as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Overall, ΔΔG spreads over 7.0 kJ mol(-1) , ΔΔH varies by 15.8 kJ mol(-1) , and -TΔΔS by 12.1 kJ mol(-1) . Throughout the series, these changes correlate remarkably well with the geometric differences of water molecules arranged adjacent to the P2 ' substituents. Ligands with medium-sized P2 ' substituents exhibit highest affinities, presumably because of their optimal solvation patterns around these complexes. The addition, removal, or rearrangement of even a single methyl group can result in a strong modulation of the adjacent water network pattern shifting from enthalpy to entropy-driven binding. In conclusion, the quality of a water network assembled around a protein-ligand complex influences the enthalpy/entropy signature and can even modulate affinity to a surprising extent. </p>

<p>The mature protease from Group N human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1) (PR1(N)) differs in 20 amino acids from the extensively studied Group M protease (PR1(M)) at positions corresponding to minor drug-resistance mutations (DRMs). The first crystal structure (1.09 Å resolution) of PR1(N) with the clinical inhibitor darunavir (DRV) reveals the same overall structure as PR1(M), but with a slightly larger inhibitor-binding cavity. Changes in the 10s loop and the flap hinge propagate to shift one flap away from the inhibitor, whereas L89F and substitutions in the 60s loop perturb inhibitor-binding residues 29-32. However, kinetic parameters of PR1(N) closely resemble those of PR1(M), and calorimetric results are consistent with similar binding affinities for DRV and two other clinical PIs, suggesting that minor DRMs coevolve to compensate for the detrimental effects of drug-specific major DRMs. A miniprecursor (TFR 1-61-PR1(N)) comprising the transframe region (TFR) fused to the N-terminus of PR1(N) undergoes autocatalytic cleavage at the TFR/PR1(N) site concomitant with the appearance of catalytic activity characteristic of the dimeric, mature enzyme. This cleavage is inhibited at an equimolar ratio of precursor to DRV (∼6 μM), which partially stabilizes the precursor dimer from a monomer. However, cleavage at L34/W35 within the TFR, which precedes the TFR 1-61/PR1(N) cleavage at pH ≤ 5, is only partially inhibited. Favorable properties of PR1(N) relative to PR1(M) include its suitability for column fractionation by size under native conditions and &gt;10-fold higher dimer dissociation constant (150 nM). Exploiting these properties may facilitate testing of potential dimerization inhibitors that perturb early precursor processing steps.</p>

<p>Chemical reactions inside single crystals are quite rare because crystallinity is difficult to retain owing to atomic rearrangements. Protein crystals in general have a high solvent content. This allows for some molecular flexibility, which makes it possible to trap reaction intermediates of enzymatic reactions without disrupting the crystal lattice. A similar approach has not yet been fully implemented in the field of inorganic chemistry. Here, we have combined model chemistry and protein X-ray crystallography to study the intramolecular aromatic dihydroxylation by an arene-containing protein-bound iron complex. The bound complex was able to activate dioxygen in the presence of a reductant, leading to the formation of catechol as the sole product. The structure determination of four of the catalytic cycle intermediates and the end product showed that the hydroxylation reaction implicates an iron peroxo, generated by reductive O(2) activation, an intermediate already observed in iron monooxygenases. This strategy also provided unexpected mechanistic details such as the rearrangement of the iron coordination sphere on metal reduction.</p>

<p>Kinetic analyses led to the discovery that N-acetylated tripeptides with polar residues at P3 are inhibitors of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) that form unusually stable acyl-enzyme complexes. Peptides terminating in a C-terminal carboxylate were more potent than those terminating in a C-terminal amide, suggesting recognition by the oxy-anion hole is important in binding. X-ray diffraction data were recorded to 0.95-A resolution for an acyl-enzyme complex formed between PPE and N-acetyl-Asn-Pro-Ile-CO2H at approximately pH 5. The accuracy of the crystallographic coordinates allows structural issues concerning the mechanism of serine proteases to be addressed. Significantly, the ester bond of the acyl-enzyme showed a high level of planarity, suggesting geometric strain of the ester link is not important during catalysis. Several hydrogen atoms could be clearly identified and were included within the model. In keeping with a recent x-ray structure of subtilisin at 0.78 A (1), limited electron density is visible consistent with the putative location of a hydrogen atom approximately equidistant between the histidine and aspartate residues of the catalytic triad. Comparison of this high resolution crystal structure of the acyl-enzyme complex with that of native elastase at 1.1 A (2) showed that binding of the N-terminal part of the substrate can be accommodated with negligible structural rearrangements. In contrast, comparison with structures obtained as part of "time-resolved" studies on the reacting acyl-enzyme complex at &gt;pH 7 (3) indicate small but significant structural differences, consistent with the proposed synchronization of ester hydrolysis and substrate release.</p>

<p>Arginine kinase catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphoryl group between ATP and l-arginine and is a monomeric homolog of the human enzyme creatine kinase. Arginine and creatine kinases belongs to the phosphagen kinase family of enzymes, which consists of eight known members, each of which is specific for its own phosphagen. Here, the source of phosphagen specificity in arginine kinase is investigated through the use of phosphagen analogs. Crystal structures have been determined for Limulus polyphemus arginine kinase with one of four arginine analogs bound in a transition state analog complex: l-ornithine, l-citrulline, imino-l-ornithine, and d-arginine. In all complexes, the enzyme achieves a closed conformation very similar to that of the cognate transition state analog complex, but differences are observed in the configurations of bound ligands. Arginine kinase exhibits no detectable activity towards ornithine, citrulline, or imino-l-ornithine, and only trace activity towards d-arginine. The crystal structures presented here demonstrate that phosphagen specificity is derived neither from a lock-and-key mechanism nor a modulation of induced-fit conformational changes, but potentially from subtle distortions in bound substrate configurations.</p>

<p>Human DNA polymerase iota (pol iota) is a unique member of Y-family polymerases, which preferentially misincorporates nucleotides opposite thymines (T) and halts replication at T bases. The structural basis of the high error rates remains elusive. We present three crystal structures of pol complexed with DNA containing a thymine base, paired with correct or incorrect incoming nucleotides. A narrowed active site supports a pyrimidine to pyrimidine mismatch and excludes Watson-Crick base pairing by pol. The template thymine remains in an anti conformation irrespective of incoming nucleotides. Incoming ddATP adopts a syn conformation with reduced base stacking, whereas incorrect dGTP and dTTP maintain anti conformations with normal base stacking. Further stabilization of dGTP by H-bonding with Gln59 of the finger domain explains the preferential T to G mismatch. A template 'U-turn' is stabilized by pol and the methyl group of the thymine template, revealing the structural basis of T stalling. Our structural and domain-swapping experiments indicate that the finger domain is responsible for pol's high error rates on pyrimidines and determines the incorporation specificity.</p>

<p>Fragment screens for new ligands have had wide success, notwithstanding their constraint to libraries of 1,000-10,000 molecules. Larger libraries would be addressable were molecular docking reliable for fragment screens, but this has not been widely accepted. To investigate docking's ability to prioritize fragments, a library of &gt;137,000 such molecules were docked against the structure of beta-lactamase. Forty-eight fragments highly ranked by docking were acquired and tested; 23 had K(i) values ranging from 0.7 to 9.2 mM. X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme-bound complexes were determined for 8 of the fragments. For 4, the correspondence between the predicted and experimental structures was high (RMSD between 1.2 and 1.4 A), whereas for another 2, the fidelity was lower but retained most key interactions (RMSD 2.4-2.6 A). Two of the 8 fragments adopted very different poses in the active site owing to enzyme conformational changes. The 48% hit rate of the fragment docking compares very favorably with "lead-like" docking and high-throughput screening against the same enzyme. To understand this, we investigated the occurrence of the fragment scaffolds among larger, lead-like molecules. Approximately 1% of commercially available fragments contain these inhibitors whereas only 10(-7)% of lead-like molecules do. This suggests that many more chemotypes and combinations of chemotypes are present among fragments than are available among lead-like molecules, contributing to the higher hit rates.

<p>NagZ is a glycoside hydrolase that participates in peptidoglycan (PG) recycling by removing β-N-acetylglucosamine from PG fragments that are excised from the bacterial cell wall during growth. Notably, the products formed by NagZ, 1,6-anhydroMurNAc-peptides, activate β-lactam resistance in many Gram-negative bacteria, making this enzyme of interest as a potential therapeutic target. Crystal structure determinations of NagZ from Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis in complex with natural substrate, trapped as a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, and bound to product, define the reaction coordinate of the NagZ family of enzymes. The structures, combined with kinetic studies, reveal an uncommon degree of structural plasticity within the active site of a glycoside hydrolase, and unveil how NagZ drives substrate distortion using a highly mobile loop that contains a conserved histidine that has been proposed as the general acid/base.</p>

<p>An alpha-2,8-linked polysialic acid (polySia) capsule confers immune tolerance to neuroinvasive, pathogenic prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli K1 and Neisseria meningitidis and supports host infection by means of molecular mimicry. Bacteriophages of the K1 family, infecting E. coli K1, specifically recognize and degrade this polySia capsule utilizing tailspike endosialidases. While the crystal structure for the catalytic domain of the endosialidase of bacteriophage K1F (endoNF) has been solved, there is yet no structural information on the mode of polySia binding and cleavage available. The crystal structure of activity deficient active-site mutants of the homotrimeric endoNF cocrystallized with oligomeric sialic acid identified three independent polySia binding sites in each endoNF monomer. The bound oligomeric sialic acid displays distinct conformations at each site. In the active site, a Sia(3) molecule is bound in an extended conformation representing the enzyme-product complex. Structural and biochemical data supported by molecular modeling enable to propose a reaction mechanism for polySia cleavage by endoNF.</p>

<p>Fragment screens for new ligands have had wide success, notwithstanding their constraint to libraries of 1,000-10,000 molecules. Larger libraries would be addressable were molecular docking reliable for fragment screens, but this has not been widely accepted. To investigate docking's ability to prioritize fragments, a library of &gt;137,000 such molecules were docked against the structure of beta-lactamase. Forty-eight fragments highly ranked by docking were acquired and tested; 23 had K(i) values ranging from 0.7 to 9.2 mM. X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme-bound complexes were determined for 8 of the fragments. For 4, the correspondence between the predicted and experimental structures was high (RMSD between 1.2 and 1.4 A), whereas for another 2, the fidelity was lower but retained most key interactions (RMSD 2.4-2.6 A). Two of the 8 fragments adopted very different poses in the active site owing to enzyme conformational changes. The 48% hit rate of the fragment docking compares very favorably with "lead-like" docking and high-throughput screening against the same enzyme. To understand this, we investigated the occurrence of the fragment scaffolds among larger, lead-like molecules. Approximately 1% of commercially available fragments contain these inhibitors whereas only 10(-7)% of lead-like molecules do. This suggests that many more chemotypes and combinations of chemotypes are present among fragments than are available among lead-like molecules, contributing to the higher hit rates. The ability of docking to prioritize these fragments suggests that the technique can be used to exploit the better chemotype coverage that exists at the fragment level.</p>

<p>A wide range of organophosphorus nerve agents, including Soman, Sarin, and Tabun is efficiently hydrolyzed by the phosphotriesterase enzyme diisopropyl fluorophosphatase (DFPase) from Loligo vulgaris. To date, the lack of available inhibitors of DFPase has limited studies on its mechanism. The de novo design, synthesis, and characterization of substrate analogues acting as competitive inhibitors of DFPase are reported. The 1.73 A crystal structure of O,O-dicyclopentylphosphoroamidate (DcPPA) bound to DFPase shows a direct coordination of the phosphoryl oxygen by the catalytic calcium ion. The binding mode of this substrate analogue suggests a crucial role for electrostatics in the orientation of the ligand in the active site. This interpretation is further supported by the crystal structures of double mutants D229N/N120D and D229N/N175D, designed to reorient the electrostatic environment around the catalytic calcium. The structures show no differences in their calcium coordinating environment, although they are enzymatically inactive. Additional double mutants E21Q/N120D and E21Q/N175D are also inactive. On the basis of these crystal structures and kinetic and mutagenesis data as well as isotope labeling we propose a new mechanism for DFPase activity. Calcium coordinating residue D229, in concert with direct substrate activation by the metal ion, renders the phosphorus atom of the substrate susceptible for attack of water, through generation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate. Our proposed mechanism may be applicable to the structurally related enzyme paraoxonase (PON), a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL).</p>

<p>Ultrahigh-resolution (&lt; 1.0 Å) structures have revealed unprecedented and unexpected details of molecular geometry, such as the deformation of aromatic rings from planarity. However, the functional utility of such energetically costly strain is unknown. The 0.83 Å structure of α-lytic protease (αLP) indicated that residues surrounding a conserved Phe side-chain dictate a rotamer which results in a ~6° distortion along the side-chain, estimated to cost 4 kcal/mol. By contrast, in the closely related protease Streptomyces griseus Protease B (SGPB), the equivalent Phe adopts a different rotamer and is undistorted. Here, we report that the αLP Phe side-chain distortion is both functional and conserved in proteases with large pro regions. Sequence analysis of the αLP serine protease family reveals a bifurcation separating those sequences expected to induce distortion and those that would not, which correlates with the extent of kinetic stability. Structural and folding kinetics analyses of family members suggest that distortion of this side-chain plays a role in increasing kinetic stability within the αLP family members that use a large Pro region. Additionally, structural and kinetic folding studies of mutants demonstrate that strain alters the folding free energy landscape by destabilizing the transition state (TS) relative to the native state (N). Although side-chain distortion comes at a cost of foldability, it suppresses the rate of unfolding, thereby enhancing kinetic stability and increasing protein longevity under harsh extracellular conditions. This ability of a structural distortion to enhance function is unlikely to be unique to αLP family members and may be relevant in other proteins exhibiting side-chain distortions.</p>

<p>Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) from the moderately thermophilic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus (CaMDH) is a tetrameric enzyme, while MDHs from mesophilic organisms usually are dimers. To investigate the potential contribution of the extra dimer-dimer interface in CaMDH with respect to thermal stability, we have engineered an intersubunit disulfide bridge designed to strengthen dimer-dimer interactions. The resulting mutant (T187C, containing two 187-187 disulfide bridges in the tetramer) showed a 200-fold increase in half-life at 75 degrees C and an increase of 15 deg. C in apparent melting temperature compared to the wild-type. The crystal structure of the mutant (solved at 1.75 A resolution) was essentially identical with that of the wild-type, with the exception of the added inter-dimer disulfide bridge and the loss of an aromatic intra-dimer contact. Remarkably, the mutant and the wild-type had similar temperature optima and activities at their temperature optima, thus providing a clear case of uncoupling of thermal stability and thermoactivity. The results show that tetramerization may contribute to MDH stability to an extent that depends strongly on the number of stabilizing interactions in the dimer-dimer interface.</p>

<p>Agarose is a gel-forming polysaccharide with an alpha-L(1,4)-3,6-anhydro-galactose, beta-D(1,3)-galactose repeat unit, from the cell walls of marine red algae. beta-agarase A, from the Gram-negative bacterium Zobellia galactanivorans, is secreted to the external medium and degrades agarose with an endo-mechanism. The structure of the inactive mutant beta-agarase A-E147S in complex with agaro-octaose has been solved at 1.7 A resolution. Two oligosaccharide chains are bound to the protein. The first one resides in the active site channel, spanning subsites -4 to -1. A second oligosaccharide binding site, on the opposite side of the protein, was filled with eight sugar units, parallel to the active site. The crystal structure of the beta-agarase A with agaro-octaose provides detailed information on agarose recognition in the catalytic site. The presence of the second, parallel, binding site suggests that the enzyme might be able to unwind the double-helical structure of agarose prior to the catalytic cleavage.</p>

<p>Endo-beta-1,4-xylanases (xylanases), which cleave beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds in the xylan backbone, are important components of the repertoire of enzymes that catalyze plant cell wall degradation. The mechanism by which these enzymes are able to hydrolyze a range of decorated xylans remains unclear. Here we reveal the three-dimensional structure, determined by x-ray crystallography, and the catalytic properties of the Cellvibrio mixtus enzyme Xyn10B (CmXyn10B), the most active GH10 xylanase described to date. The crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with xylopentaose reveals that at the +1 subsite the xylose moiety is sandwiched between hydrophobic residues, which is likely to mediate tighter binding than in other GH10 xylanases. The crystal structure of the xylanase in complex with a range of decorated xylooligosaccharides reveals how this enzyme is able to hydrolyze substituted xylan. Solvent exposure of the O-2 groups of xylose at the +4, +3, +1, and -3 subsites may allow accommodation of the alpha-1,2-linked 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid side chain in glucuronoxylan at these locations. Furthermore, the uronic acid makes hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme at the +1 subsite, indicating that the sugar decorations in glucuronoxylan are targeted to this proximal aglycone binding site. Accommodation of 3'-linked l-arabinofuranoside decorations is observed in the -2 subsite and could, most likely, be tolerated when bound to xylosides in -3 and +4. A notable feature of the binding mode of decorated substrates is the way in which the subsite specificities are tailored both to prevent the formation of "dead-end" reaction products and to facilitate synergy with the xylan degradation-accessory enzymes such as alpha-glucuronidase. The data described in this report and in the accompanying paper indicate that the complementarity in the binding of decorated substrates between the glycone and aglycone regions appears to be a conserved feature of GH10 xylanases.</p>

<p>HIV-1 protease (PR) and two drug-resistant variants--PR with the V82A mutation (PR(V82A)) and PR with the I84V mutation (PR(I84V))--were studied using reduced peptide analogs of five natural cleavage sites (CA-p2, p2-NC, p6pol-PR, p1-p6 and NC-p1) to understand the structural and kinetic changes. The common drug-resistant mutations V82A and I84V alter residues forming the substrate-binding site. Eight crystal structures were refined at resolutions of 1.10-1.60 A. Differences in the PR-analog interactions depended on the peptide sequence and were consistent with the relative inhibition. Analog p6(pol)-PR formed more hydrogen bonds of P2 Asn with PR and fewer van der Waals contacts at P1' Pro compared with those formed by CA-p2 or p2-NC in PR complexes. The P3 Gly in p1-p6 provided fewer van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds at P2-P3 and more water-mediated interactions. PR(I84V) showed reduced van der Waals interactions with inhibitor compared with PR, which was consistent with kinetic data. The structures suggest that the binding affinity for mutants is modulated by the conformational flexibility of the substrate analogs. The complexes of PR(V82A) showed smaller shifts of the main chain atoms of Ala82 relative to PR, but more movement of the peptide analog, compared to complexes with clinical inhibitors. PR(V82A) was able to compensate for the loss of interaction with inhibitor caused by mutation, in agreement with kinetic data, but substrate analogs have more flexibility than the drugs to accommodate the structural changes caused by mutation. Hence, these structures help to explain how HIV can develop drug resistance while retaining the ability of PR to hydrolyze natural substrates.</p>

<p>In recent decades, several canonical serine protease inhibitor families have been classified and characterized. In contrast to most trypsin inhibitors, those from garden four o'clock (Mirabilis jalapa) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) do not share sequence similarity and have been proposed to form the new Mirabilis serine protease inhibitor family. These 30-40-amino-acid inhibitors possess a defined disulfide-bridge topology and belong to the cystine-knot miniproteins (knottins). To date, no atomic structure of this inhibitor family has been solved. Here, the first structure of S. oleracea trypsin inhibitor III (SOTI-III), in complex with bovine pancreatic trypsin, is reported. The inhibitor was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis on a multi-milligram scale and was assayed to test its inhibitory activity and binding properties. The structure confirmed the proposed cystine-bridge topology. The structural features of SOTI-III suggest that it belongs to a new canonical serine protease inhibitor family with promising properties for use in protein-engineering and medical applications.</p>

<p>Chorismate mutase catalyzes the first committed step toward the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine. While this biosynthetic pathway exists exclusively in the cell cytoplasm, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme has been shown to be secreted into the extracellular medium. The secretory nature of the enzyme and its existence in M. tuberculosis as a duplicated gene are suggestive of its role in host-pathogen interactions. We report here the crystal structure of homodimeric chorismate mutase (Rv1885c) from M. tuberculosis determined at 2.15 A resolution. The structure suggests possible gene duplication within each subunit of the dimer (residues 35-119 and 130-199) and reveals an interesting proline-rich region on the protein surface (residues 119-130), which might act as a recognition site for protein-protein interactions. The structure also offers an explanation for its regulation by small ligands, such as tryptophan, a feature previously unknown in the prototypical Escherichia coli chorismate mutase. The tryptophan ligand is found to be sandwiched between the two monomers in a dimer contacting residues 66-68. The active site in the "gene-duplicated" monomer is occupied by a sulfate ion and is located in the first half of the polypeptide, unlike in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) enzyme, where it is located in the later half. We hypothesize that the M. tuberculosis chorismate mutase might have a role to play in host-pathogen interactions, making it an important target for designing inhibitor molecules against the deadly pathogen.</p>

<p>The hyperthermophilic endoglucanase Cel5A from Thermotoga maritima can find applications in lignocellulosic biofuel production, because it catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucan- and mannan-based polysaccharides. Here, we report the crystal structures in apo-form and in complex with three ligands, cellotetraose, cellobiose and mannotriose, at 1.29Å to 2.40Å resolution. The open carbohydrate-binding cavity which can accommodate oligosaccharide substrates with extensively branched chains explained the dual specificity of the enzyme. Combining our structural information and the previous kinetic data, it is suggested that this enzyme prefers β-glucosyl and β-mannosyl moieties at the reducing end and uses two conserved catalytic residues, E253 (nucleophile) and E136 (general acid/base), to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds. Moreover, our results also suggest that the wide spectrum of Tm_Cel5A substrates might be due to the lack of steric hindrance around the C2-hydroxyl group of the glucose or mannose unit from active-site residues.</p>

<p>Pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase (PvlArgDC) catalyzes the first step of the polyamine-biosynthetic pathway in plants and some archaebacteria.

Based on the native structure of PvlArgDC from Methanococcus jannaschii, the conserved residues Asn47 and Glu109 were proposed to be involved in the decarboxylation and autoprocessing reactions. N47A and E109Q mutant proteins were prepared and the three-dimensional structure of each protein was determined at 2.0 A resolution. The N47A and E109Q mutant proteins showed reduced decarboxylation activity compared with the wild-type PvlArgDC. These residues may also be important for the autoprocessing reaction, which utilizes a mechanism similar to that of the decarboxylation reaction.</p>

<p>Anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (AnPRT, EC 2.4.2.18) is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reaction between 5'-phosphoribosyl 1'-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and anthranilate, as part of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. Here we present the results of the first chemical screen for inhibitors against Mycobacterium tuberculosis AnPRT (Mtb-AnPRT), along with crystal structures of Mtb-AnPRT in complex with PRPP and several inhibitors. Previous work revealed that PRPP is bound at the base of a deep cleft in Mtb-AnPRT and predicted two anthranilate binding sites along the tunnel leading to the PRPP binding site. Unexpectedly, the inhibitors presented here almost exclusively bound at the entrance of the tunnel, in the presumed noncatalytic anthranilate binding site, previously hypothesized to have a role in substrate capture. The potencies of the inhibitors were measured, yielding Ki values of 1.5-119 μM, with the strongest inhibition displayed by a bianthranilate compound that makes hydrogen bond and salt bridge contacts with Mtb-AnPRT via its carboxyl groups. Our results reveal how the substrate capture mechanism of AnPRT can be exploited to inhibit the enzyme's activity and provide a scaffold for the design of improved Mtb-AnPRT inhibitors that may ultimately form the basis of new antituberculosis drugs with a novel mode of action. </p>

<p>The Sir2 family of proteins consists of broadly conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases that are implicated in diverse biological processes, including DNA regulation, metabolism, and longevity. Sir2 proteins are regulated in part by the cellular concentrations of a noncompetitive inhibitor, nicotinamide, that reacts with a Sir2 reaction intermediate via a base-exchange reaction to reform NAD(+) at the expense of deacetylation. To gain a mechanistic understanding of nicotinamide inhibition in Sir2 enzymes, we captured the structure of nicotinamide bound to a Sir2 homolog, yeast Hst2, in complex with its acetyl-lysine 16 histone H4 substrate and a reaction intermediate analog, ADP-HPD. Together with related biochemical studies and structures, we identify a nicotinamide inhibition and base-exchange site that is distinct from the so-called "C pocket" binding site for the nicotinamide group of NAD(+). These results provide insights into the Sir2 mechanism of nicotinamide inhibition and have important implications for the development of Sir2-specific effectors.</p>

<p>The identity of the interstitial light atom in the center of the FeMo cofactor of nitrogenase has been enigmatic since its discovery. Atomic-resolution x-ray diffraction data and an electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) analysis now provide direct evidence that the ligand is a carbon species.</p>

<p>Darunavir is the most recently approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease (PR) inhibitor (PI) and is active against many HIV type 1 PR variants resistant to earlier-generation PIs. Darunavir shows a high genetic barrier to resistance development, and virus strains with lower sensitivity to darunavir have a higher number of PI resistance-associated mutations than viruses resistant to other PIs. In this work, we have enzymologically and structurally characterized a number of highly mutated clinically derived PRs with high levels of phenotypic resistance to darunavir. With 18 to 21 amino acid residue changes, the PR variants studied in this work are the most highly mutated HIV PR species ever studied by means of enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography. The recombinant proteins showed major defects in substrate binding, while the substrate turnover was less affected. Remarkably, the overall catalytic efficiency of the recombinant PRs (5% that of the wild-type enzyme) is still sufficient to support polyprotein processing and particle maturation in the corresponding viruses. The X-ray structures of drug-resistant PRs complexed with darunavir suggest that the impaired inhibitor binding could be explained by change in the PR-inhibitor hydrogen bond pattern in the P2' binding pocket due to a substantial shift of the aminophenyl moiety of the inhibitor. Recombinant virus phenotypic characterization, enzyme kinetics, and X-ray structural analysis thus help to explain darunavir resistance development in HIV-positive patients.</p>

<p>Structural data are reported to 2.5 A resolution for the first full analysis of the methotrexate-resistant Leu22Arg (L22R) variant of mouse dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR) crystallized as a ternary complex with methotrexate (MTX) and the cofactor NADPH. These results are compared with the MTX and NADPH ternary complexes of L22R human DHFR (hDHFR) and those of mouse and human wild-type DHFR enzymes. The conformation of mDHFR Arg22 is such that it makes hydrogen-bonding contacts with Asp21, Trp24 and a structural water molecule, observations which were not made in the L22R hDHFR ternary complex. These data show that there is little difference between the structures of the wild type and L22R variant for either mouse or human DHFR; however, there are significant differences between the species. Comparison of these structures reveals that the active site of mDHFR is larger than that in the hDHFR structure. In mDHFR, the position of MTX is shifted 0.6 A toward helix C (residues 59-65), which in turn is shifted 1.2 A away from the active site relative to that observed in the hDHFR ternary complexes. In the L22R variant mDHFR structure, MTX makes shorter contacts to the conserved residues Ile7, Val115 and Tyr121 than in the L22R variant human DHFR structure. These contacts are comparable in both wild-type enzymes. The unexpected results from this comparison of the mouse and human DHFR complexes bound with the same ligand and cofactor illustrate the importance of detailed study of several species of enzyme, even when there is a high sequence homology between them. These data suggest that the differences in binding interactions of the L22R variant are in agreement with the weaker binding affinity for MTX in the variant enzymes; the larger size of the binding site in mDHFR supports the observation that the binding affinity of MTX for L22R mDHFR is significantly weaker than that of the L22R hDHFR enzyme.</p>

<p>A series of compounds incorporating both sulfonamide and sulfamide as zinc-binding groups (ZBGs) are reported as inhibitors of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1). Crystallographic studies on the complex of hCA II with the lead compound of this series, namely, 4-sulfamido-benzenesulfonamide, revealed the binding of two molecules in the enzyme active site cavity, the first one canonically coordinated to the zinc ion by means of the sulfonamide group and the second one located at the entrance of the cavity. This observation led to the design of elongated molecules incorporating these two ZBGs, separated by a linker of proper length, to allow the simultaneous binding to these different sites. The "long" inhibitors indeed showed around 10 times better enzyme inhibitory properties as compared to the shorter molecules against four physiologically relevant human (h) isoforms, hCA I, II, IX, and XII.</p>

<p>Unlike most DNA viruses, poxviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells. They encode enzymes needed for genome replication and transcription, including their own thymidine and thymidylate kinases. Some herpes viruses encode only 1 enzyme catalyzing both reactions, a peculiarity used for prodrug activation to obtain maximum specificity. We have solved the crystal structures of vaccinia virus thymidylate kinase bound to TDP or brivudin monophosphate. Although the viral and human enzymes have similar sequences (42% identity), they differ in their homodimeric association and active-site geometry. The vaccinia TMP kinase dimer arrangement is orthogonal and not antiparallel as in human enzyme. This different monomer orientation is related to the presence of a canal connecting the edge of the dimer interface to the TMP base binding pocket. Consequently, the pox enzyme accommodates nucleotides with bulkier bases, like brivudin monophosphate and dGMP; these are efficiently phosphorylated and stabilize the enzyme. The brivudin monophosphate-bound structure explains the structural basis for this specificity, opening the way to the rational development of specific antipox agents that may also be suitable for poxvirus TMP kinase gene-based chemotherapy of cancer.</p>

<p>Fragment screens for new ligands have had wide success, notwithstanding their constraint to libraries of 1,000-10,000 molecules. Larger libraries would be addressable were molecular docking reliable for fragment screens, but this has not been widely accepted. To investigate docking's ability to prioritize fragments, a library of &gt;137,000 such molecules were docked against the structure of beta-lactamase. Forty-eight fragments highly ranked by docking were acquired and tested; 23 had K(i) values ranging from 0.7 to 9.2 mM. X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme-bound complexes were determined for 8 of the fragments. For 4, the correspondence between the predicted and experimental structures was high (RMSD between 1.2 and 1.4 A), whereas for another 2, the fidelity was lower but retained most key interactions (RMSD 2.4-2.6 A). Two of the 8 fragments adopted very different poses in the active site owing to enzyme conformational changes. The 48% hit rate of the fragment docking compares very favorably with "lead-like" docking and high-throughput screening against the same enzyme. To understand this, we investigated the occurrence of the fragment scaffolds among larger, lead-like molecules. Approximately 1% of commercially available fragments contain these inhibitors whereas only 10(-7)% of lead-like molecules do. This suggests that many more chemotypes and combinations of chemotypes are present among fragments than are available among lead-like molecules, contributing to the higher hit rates. The ability of docking to prioritize these fragments suggests that the technique can be used to exploit the better chemotype coverage that exists at the fragment level.</p>

<p>PabB, aminodeoxychorismate synthase, is the chorismic acid binding component of the heterodimeric PabA-PabB complex that converts chorismic acid to 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate, a precursor of p-aminobenzoate and folic acid in microorganisms. The second component, a glutamine amidotransferase subunit, PabA, generates ammonia that is channeled to the PabB active site where it attacks C4 of a chorismate-derived intermediate that is covalently bound, through C2, to an active site lysine residue. The presence of a PIKGT motif was, until recently, believed to allow discrimination of PabB enzymes from the closely related enzyme anthranilate synthase, which typically contains a PIAGT active site motif and does not form a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate with chorismate. A subclass of PabB enzymes that employ an alternative mechanism requiring 2 equiv of ammonia from glutamine and that feature a noncovalently bound 2-amino-2-deoxyisochorismate intermediate was recently identified. Here we report the 2.25 Å crystal structure of PabB from the emerging pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. It is the first reported structure of a PabB that features the PIAGT motif. Surprisingly, no dedicated pabA is evident in the genome of S. maltophilia, suggesting that another cellular amidotransferase is able to fulfill the role of PabA in this organism. Evaluation of the ammonia-dependent aminodeoxychorismate synthase activity of S. maltophilia PabB alone revealed that it is virtually inactive. However, in the presence of a heterologous PabA surrogate, typical levels of activity were observed using either glutamine or ammonia as the nitrogen source. Additionally, the structure suggests that a key segment of the polypeptide can remodel itself to interact with a nonspecialized or shared amidotransferase partner in vivo. The structure and mass spectral analysis further suggest that S. maltophilia PabB, like Escherichia coli PabB, binds tryptophan in a vestigial regulatory site. The observation that the binding site is unoccupied in the crystal structure, however, suggests the affinity may be low relative to that of E. coli PabB.</p>

<p>A key enzyme in the biosynthesis of clinically important aminoglycoside antibiotics is 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase (DOIS), which catalyzes carbocycle formation from D-glucose-6-phosphate to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose through a multistep reaction. This reaction mechanism is similar to the catalysis by dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) of the cyclization of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heputulosonate-7-phosphate to dehydroquinate in the shikimate pathway, but significant dissimilarity between these enzymes is also known, particularly in the stereochemistry of the phosphate elimination reaction and the cyclization. Here, the crystal structures of DOIS from Bacillus circulans and its complex with the substrate analog inhibitor carbaglucose-6-phosphate, NAD+, and Co2+ have been determined to provide structural insights into the reaction mechanism. The complex structure shows that an active site exists between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains and that the inhibitor coordinates a cobalt ion in this site. Two subunits exist as a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The two active sites of the dimer were observed to be different. One contains a dephosphorylated compound derived from the inhibitor and the other includes the inhibitor without change. The present study suggested that phosphate elimination proceeds through syn-elimination assisted by Glu 243 and the aldol condensation proceeds via a boat conformation. Also discussed are significant similarities and dissimilarities between DOIS and DHQS, particularly in terms of the structure at the active site and the reaction mechanism.</p>

<p>The structure of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (also known as arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; AANAT) bound to a potent bisubstrate analog inhibitor has been determined at 2.0 A resolution using a two-edge (Se, Br) multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiment. This acetyl-CoA dependent enzyme is a member of the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases (GNATs), which share four conserved sequence motifs (A-D). In serotonin N-acetyltransferase, motif A adopts an alpha/beta conformation characteristic of the phylogenetically invariant cofactor binding site seen in all previously characterized GNATs. Motif B displays a significantly lower level of conservation among family members, giving rise to a novel alpha/beta structure for the serotonin binding slot. Utilization of a brominated CoA-S-acetyl-tryptamine-bisubstrate analog inhibitor and the MAD method permitted conclusive identification of two radically different conformations for the tryptamine moiety in the catalytic site (cis and trans). A second high-resolution X-ray structure of the enzyme bound to a bisubstrate analog inhibitor, with a longer tether between the acetyl-CoA and tryptamine moieties, demonstrates only the trans conformation. Given a previous proposal that AANAT can catalyze an alkyltransferase reaction in a conformationally altered active site relative to its acetyltransferase activity, it is possible that the two conformations of the bisubstrate analog observed crystallographically correspond to these alternative reaction pathways. Our findings may ultimately lead to the design of analogs with improved AANAT inhibitory properties for in vivo applications.</p>

<p>Structure-based design (SBD) can be used for the design and/or optimization of new inhibitors for a biological target. Whereas de novo SBD is rarely used, most reports on SBD are dealing with the optimization of an initial hit. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) has emerged as a powerful strategy to identify bioactive ligands given that it enables the target to direct the synthesis of its strongest binder. We have designed a library of potential inhibitors (acylhydrazones) generated from five aldehydes and five hydrazides and used DCC to identify the best binder(s). After addition of the aspartic protease endothiapepsin, we characterized the protein-bound library member(s) by saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. Cocrystallization experiments validated the predicted binding mode of the two most potent inhibitors, thus demonstrating that the combination of de novo SBD and DCC constitutes an efficient starting point for hit identification and optimization. </p>

<p>The 70 kDa soluble lytic transglycosylase (Slt70) from Escherichia coli is an exo-muramidase, that catalyses the cleavage of the glycosidic bonds between N -acetylmuramic acid and N -acetylglucosamine residues in peptidoglycan, the main structural component of the bacterial cell wall. This cleavage is accompanied by the formation of a 1,6-anhydro bond between the C1 and O6 atoms in the N -acetylmuramic acid residue (anhMurNAc). Crystallographic studies at medium resolution revealed that Slt70 is a multi-domain protein consisting of a large ring-shaped alpha-superhelix with on top a catalytic domain, which resembles the fold of goose-type lysozyme. Here we report the crystal structures of native Slt70 and of its complex with a 1,6-anhydromuropeptide solved at nominal resolutions of 1.65 A and 1.90 A, respectively. The high resolution native structure reveals the details on the hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that stabilise the catalytic domain and the alpha-superhelix. The building-block of the alpha-superhelix is an "up-down-up-down" four-alpha-helix bundle involving both parallel and antiparallel helix pairs. Stabilisation of the fold is provided through an extensive packing of apolar atoms, mostly from leucine and alanine residues. It lacks, however, an internal consensus sequence that characterises other super-secondary helical folds like the beta-helix in pectate lyase or the (beta-alpha)-helix in the ribonuclease inhibitor. The 1, 6-anhydromuropeptide product binds in a shallow groove adjacent to the peptidoglycan-binding groove of the catalytic domain. The groove is formed by conserved residues at the interface of the catalytic domain and the alpha-superhelix. The structure of the Slt70-1, 6-anhydromuropeptide complex confirms the presence of a specific binding-site for the peptide moieties of the peptidoglycan and it substantiates the notion that Slt70 starts the cleavage reaction at the anhMurNAc end of the peptidoglycan.</p>

<p>F(420)-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin (methylene-H(4)MPT) dehydrogenase (Mtd) of Methanopyrus kandleri is an enzyme of the methanogenic energy metabolism that catalyzes the reversible hydride transfer between methenyl-H(4)MPT(+) and methylene-H(4)MPT using coenzyme F(420) as hydride carrier. We determined the structures of the Mtd-methylene-H(4)MPT, Mtd-methenyl-H(4)MPT(+), and the Mtd-methenyl-H(4)MPT(+)-F(420)H(2) complexes at 2.1, 2.0, and 1.8 A resolution, respectively. The pterin-imidazolidine-phenyl ring system is present in a new extended but not planar conformation which is virtually identical in methenyl-H(4)MPT(+) and methylene-H(4)MPT at the current resolution. Both substrates methenyl-H(4)MPT(+) and F(420)H(2) bind in a face to face arrangement to an active site cleft, thereby ensuring a direct hydride transfer between their C14a and C5 atoms, respectively. The polypeptide scaffold does not reveal any significant conformational change upon binding of the bulky substrates but in turn changes the conformations of the substrate rings either to avoid clashes between certain ring atoms or to adjust the rings involved in hydride transfer for providing an optimal catalytic efficiency.</p>

<p>Cytochrome P450 CYP121 is essential for the viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Studies in vitro show that it can use the cyclodipeptide cyclo(l-Tyr-l-Tyr) (cYY) as a substrate. We report an investigation of the substrate and reaction specificities of CYP121 involving analysis of the interaction between CYP121 and 14 cYY analogues with various modifications of the side chains or the diketopiperazine (DKP) ring. Spectral titration experiments show that CYP121 significantly bound only cyclodipeptides with a conserved DKP ring carrying two aryl side chains in l-configuration. CYP121 did not efficiently or selectively transform any of the cYY analogues tested, indicating a high specificity for cYY. The molecular determinants of this specificity were inferred from both crystal structures of CYP121-analog complexes solved at high resolution and solution NMR spectroscopy of the analogues. Bound cYY or its analogues all displayed a similar set of contacts with CYP121 residues Asn(85), Phe(168), and Trp(182). The propensity of the cYY tyrosyl to point toward Arg(386) was dependent on the presence of the DKP ring that limits the conformational freedom of the ligand. The correct positioning of the hydroxyl of this tyrosyl was essential for conversion of cYY. Thus, the specificity of CYP121 results from both a restricted binding specificity and a fine-tuned P450 substrate relationship. These results document the catalytic mechanism of CYP121 and improve our understanding of its function in vivo. This work contributes to progress toward the design of inhibitors of this essential protein of M. tuberculosis that could be used for antituberculosis therapy.</p>

<p>Terminal deoxynucletidyl transferase (TdT) is overexpressed in some cancer types, where it might compete with pol μ during the mutagenic repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) through the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Here we report the discovery and characterization of pyrrolyl and indolyl diketo acids that specifically target TdT and behave as nucleotide-competitive inhibitors. These compounds show a selective toxicity toward MOLT-4 compared to HeLa cells that correlate well with in vitro selectivity for TdT. The binding site of two of these inhibitors was determined by cocrystallization with TdT, explaining why these compounds are competitive inhibitors of the deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP). In addition, because of the observed dual localization of the phenyl substituent, these studies open the possibility of rationally designing more potent compounds. </p>

<p>Octopine dehydrogenase (OcDH) from the adductor muscle of the great scallop, Pecten maximus, catalyzes the NADH dependent, reductive condensation of L-arginine and pyruvate to octopine, NAD(+), and water during escape swimming and/or subsequent recovery. The structure of OcDH was recently solved and a reaction mechanism was proposed which implied an ordered binding of NADH, L-arginine and finally pyruvate. Here, the order of substrate binding as well as the underlying conformational changes were investigated by NMR confirming the model derived from the crystal structures. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the OcDH/NADH/agmatine complex was determined which suggests a key role of the side chain of L-arginine in protein cataylsis. Thus, the order of substrate binding to OcDH as well as the molecular signals involved in octopine formation can now be described in molecular detail.</p>

<p>Beta-lactamases hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics and are the leading cause of bacterial resistance to these drugs. Although beta-lactamases have been extensively studied, structures of the substrate-enzyme and product-enzyme complexes have proven elusive. Here, the structure of a mutant AmpC in complex with the beta-lactam cephalothin in its substrate and product forms was determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.53 A resolution. The acyl-enzyme intermediate between AmpC and cephalothin was determined to 2.06 A resolution. The ligand undergoes a dramatic conformational change as the reaction progresses, with the characteristic six-membered dihydrothiazine ring of cephalothin rotating by 109 degrees. These structures correspond to all three intermediates along the reaction path and provide insight into substrate recognition, catalysis, and product expulsion.</p>

<p>The formation of carbon-carbon bonds via an acyl-enzyme intermediate plays a central role in fatty acid, polyketide, and isoprenoid biosynthesis. Uniquely among condensing enzymes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGS) catalyzes the formation of a carbon-carbon bond by activating the methyl group of an acetylated cysteine. This reaction is essential in Gram-positive bacteria, and represents the first committed step in human cholesterol biosynthesis. Reaction kinetics, isotope exchange, and mass spectroscopy suggest surprisingly that HMGS is able to catalyze the "backwards" reaction in solution, where HMG-CoA is cleaved to form acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAc-CoA) and acetate. Here, we trap a complex of acetylated HMGS from Staphylococcus aureus and bound acetoacetyl-CoA by cryo-cooling enzyme crystals at three different times during the course of its back-reaction with its physiological product (HMG-CoA). This nonphysiological "backwards" reaction is used to understand the details of the physiological reaction with regards to individual residues involved in catalysis and substrate/product binding. The structures suggest that an active-site glutamic acid (Glu-79) acts as a general base both in the condensation between acetoacetyl-CoA and the acetylated enzyme, and the hydrolytic release of HMG-CoA from the enzyme. The ability to trap this enzyme-intermediate complex may suggest a role for protein dynamics and the interplay between protomers during the normal course of catalysis.</p>

The structures suggest that an active-site glutamic acid (Glu-79) acts as a general base both in the condensation between acetoacetyl-CoA and the acetylated enzyme, and the hydrolytic release of HMG-CoA from the enzyme. The ability to trap this enzyme-intermediate complex may suggest a role for protein dynamics and the interplay between protomers during the normal course of catalysis.</p>

<p>The formation of carbon-carbon bonds via an acyl-enzyme intermediate plays a central role in fatty acid, polyketide, and isoprenoid biosynthesis. Uniquely among condensing enzymes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGS) catalyzes the formation of a carbon-carbon bond by activating the methyl group of an acetylated cysteine. This reaction is essential in Gram-positive bacteria, and represents the first committed step in human cholesterol biosynthesis. Reaction kinetics, isotope exchange, and mass spectroscopy suggest surprisingly that HMGS is able to catalyze the "backwards" reaction in solution, where HMG-CoA is cleaved to form acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAc-CoA) and acetate. Here, we trap a complex of acetylated HMGS from Staphylococcus aureus and bound acetoacetyl-CoA by cryo-cooling enzyme crystals at three different times during the course of its back-reaction with its physiological product (HMG-CoA).

<p>Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of guanine in the wobble position of particular tRNAs by the modified base preQ(1). In vitro, however, the enzyme is also able to insert the immediate biosynthetic precursor, preQ(0), into those tRNAs. This substrate promiscuity is based on a peptide switch in the active site, gated by the general acid/base Glu235. The switch alters the properties of the binding pocket to allow either the accommodation of guanine or preQ(1). The peptide conformer recognising guanine, however, is also able to bind preQ(0). To investigate selectivity regulation, kinetic data for Zymomonas mobilis Tgt were recorded. They show that selectivity in favour of the actual substrate preQ(1) over preQ(0) is not achieved by a difference in affinity but via a higher turnover rate. Moreover, a Tgt(Glu235Gln) variant was constructed. The mutation was intended to stabilise the peptide switch in the conformation favouring guanine and preQ(0) binding. Kinetic characterisation of the mutated enzyme revealed that the Glu235Gln exchange has, with respect to all substrate bases, no significant influence on k(cat). In contrast, K(M)(preQ(1)) is drastically increased, while K(M)(preQ(0)) seems to be decreased. Hence, regarding k(cat)/K(M) as an indicator for catalytic efficiency, selectivity of Tgt in favour of preQ(1) is abolished or even inverted in favour of preQ(0) for Tgt(Glu235Gln). Crystal structures of the mutated enzyme confirm that the mutation strongly favours the binding pocket conformation required for the accommodation of guanine and preQ(0). The way this is achieved, however, significantly differs from that predicted based on crystal structures of wild-type Tgt.</p>

<p>Human coilin interacting nuclear ATPase protein (hCINAP) directly interacts with coilin, a marker protein of Cajal Bodies (CBs), nuclear organelles involved in the maturation of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins UsnRNPs and snoRNPs. hCINAP has previously been designated as an adenylate kinase (AK6), but is very atypical as it exhibits unusually broad substrate specificity, structural features characteristic of ATPase/GTPase proteins (Walker motifs A and B) and also intrinsic ATPase activity. Despite its intriguing structure, unique properties and cellular localization, the enzymatic mechanism and biological function of hCINAP have remained poorly characterized. Here, we offer the first high-resolution structure of hCINAP in complex with the substrate ADP (and dADP), the structure of hCINAP with a sulfate ion bound at the AMP binding site, and the structure of the ternary complex hCINAP-Mg(2+) ADP-Pi. Induced fit docking calculations are used to predict the structure of the hCINAP-Mg(2+) ATP-AMP ternary complex. Structural analysis suggested a functional role for His79 in the Walker B motif. Kinetic analysis of mutant hCINAP-H79G indicates that His79 affects both AK and ATPase catalytic efficiency and induces homodimer formation. Finally, we show that in vivo expression of hCINAP-H79G in human cells is toxic and drastically deregulates the number and appearance of CBs in the cell nucleus. Our findings suggest that hCINAP may not simply regulate nucleotide homeostasis, but may have broader functionality, including control of CB assembly and disassembly in the nucleus of human cells.</p>

<p>DNA polymerase (pol) β is a model polymerase involved in gap-filling DNA synthesis utilizing two metals to facilitate nucleotidyl transfer. Previous structural studies have trapped catalytic intermediates by utilizing substrate analogs (dideoxy-terminated primer or nonhydrolysable incoming nucleotide). To identify additional intermediates during catalysis, we now employ natural substrates (correct and incorrect nucleotides) and follow product formation in real time with 15 different crystal structures. We are able to observe molecular adjustments at the active site that hasten correct nucleotide insertion and deter incorrect insertion not appreciated previously. A third metal binding site is transiently formed during correct, but not incorrect, nucleotide insertion. Additionally, long incubations indicate that pyrophosphate more easily dissociates after incorrect, compared to correct, nucleotide insertion. This appears to be coupled to subdomain repositioning that is required for catalytic activation/deactivation. The structures provide insights into a fundamental chemical reaction that impacts polymerase fidelity and genome stability. </p>

<p>Photosynthetic organisms adopt two different strategies for the reduction of the C17 = C18 double bond of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to form chlorophyllide a, the direct precursor of chlorophyll a (refs 1-4). The first involves the activity of the light-dependent Pchlide oxidoreductase, and the second involves the light-independent (dark-operative) Pchlide oxidoreductase (DPOR). DPOR is a nitrogenase-like enzyme consisting of two components, L-protein (a BchL dimer) and NB-protein (a BchN-BchB heterotetramer), which are structurally related to nitrogenase Fe protein and MoFe protein, respectively. Here we report the crystal structure of the NB-protein of DPOR from Rhodobacter capsulatus at a resolution of 2.3A. As expected, the overall structure is similar to that of nitrogenase MoFe protein: each catalytic BchN-BchB unit contains one Pchlide and one iron-sulphur cluster (NB-cluster) coordinated uniquely by one aspartate and three cysteines. Unique aspartate ligation is not necessarily needed for the cluster assembly but is essential for the catalytic activity. Specific Pchlide-binding accompanies the partial unwinding of an alpha-helix that belongs to the next catalytic BchN-BchB unit. We propose a unique trans-specific reduction mechanism in which the distorted C17-propionate of Pchlide and an aspartate from BchB serve as proton donors for C18 and C17 of Pchlide, respectively. Intriguingly, the spatial arrangement of the NB-cluster and Pchlide is almost identical to that of the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase MoFe-protein, illustrating that a common architecture exists to reduce chemically stable multibonds of porphyrin and dinitrogen.</p>

<p>Kinetics, thermodynamics and structural aspects of human alpha-thrombin (thrombin) inhibition by newly synthesized low molecular weight derivatives of alpha-azalysine have been investigated. The thrombin catalyzed hydrolysis of N-ethoxycarbonyl-D-Phe-Pro-alpha-azaLys p-nitrophenyl ester (Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-azaLys-ONp) and N-carbobenzoxy-Pro-alpha-azaLys p-nitrophenyl ester (Cbz-Pro-azaLys-ONp) was investigated at pH 6.2 and 21.0 degrees C, and analyzed in parallel with that of N-alpha-(N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl)-alpha-azalysine p-nitrophenyl ester (Dmc-azaLys-ONp). Decarboxylation following the enzymatic hydrolysis of these p-nitrophenyl esters gave the corresponding 1-peptidyl-2(4-aminobutyl) hydrazines (peptidyl-Abh) showing properties of thrombin competitive inhibitors. Therefore, thermodynamics for the reversible binding of D-Phe-Pro-Abh, Cbz-Pro-Abh and Dmc-Abh to thrombin was examined. These results are consistent with the minimum four-step catalytic mechanism for product inhibition of serine proteinases. Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-azaLys-ONp and Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-Abh display a sub-micromolar affinity for thrombin together with a high selectivity versus homologous plasmatic and pancreatic serine proteinases acting on cationic substrates. The three-dimensional structures of the reversible non-covalent thrombin:Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-Abh and thrombin:Cbz-Pro-Abh complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.0 A resolution (R-factor = 0.169 and 0.179, respectively), and analyzed in parallel with that of the thrombin:Dmc-azaLys acyl-enzyme adduct. Both Eoc-D-Phe-Pro-Abh and Cbz-Pro-Abh competitive inhibitors are accommodated in the thrombin active center, spanning the region between the aryl binding site and the S1 primary specificity subsite.</p>

<p>beta-1,4-Galactosyltransferase-I (beta4Gal-T1) transfers galactose from UDP-galactose to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues of the branched N-linked oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins. In an N-linked biantennary oligosaccharide chain, one antenna is attached to the 3-hydroxyl-(1,3-arm), and the other to the 6-hydroxyl-(1,6-arm) group of mannose, which is beta-1,4-linked to an N-linked chitobiose, attached to the aspargine residue of a protein. For a better understanding of the branch specificity of beta4Gal-T1 towards the GlcNAc residues of N-glycans, we have carried out kinetic and crystallographic studies with the wild-type human beta4Gal-T1 (h-beta4Gal-T1) and the mutant Met340His-beta4Gal-T1 (h-M340H-beta4Gal-T1) in complex with a GlcNAc-containing pentasaccharide and several GlcNAc-containing trisaccharides present in N-glycans. The oligosaccharides used were: pentasaccharide GlcNAcbeta1,2-Manalpha1,6 (GlcNAcbeta1,2-Manalpha1,3)Man; the 1,6-arm trisaccharide, GlcNAcbeta1,2-Manalpha1,6-Manbeta-OR (1,2-1,6-arm); the 1,3-arm trisaccharides, GlcNAcbeta1,2-Manalpha1,3-Manbeta-OR (1,2-1,3-arm) and GlcNAcbeta1,4-Manalpha1,3-Manbeta-OR (1,4-1,3-arm); and the trisaccharide GlcNAcbeta1,4-GlcNAcbeta1,4-GlcNAc (chitotriose). With the wild-type h-beta4Gal-T1, the K(m) of 1,2-1,6-arm is approximately tenfold lower than for 1,2-1,3-arm and 1,4-1,3-arm, and 22-fold lower than for chitotriose. Crystal structures of h-M340H-beta4Gal-T1 in complex with the pentasaccharide and various trisaccharides at 1.9-2.0A resolution showed that beta4Gal-T1 is in a closed conformation with the oligosaccharide bound to the enzyme, and the 1,2-1,6-arm trisaccharide makes the maximum number of interactions with the enzyme, which is in concurrence with the lowest K(m) for the trisaccharide. Present studies suggest that beta4Gal-T1 interacts preferentially with the 1,2-1,6-arm trisaccharide rather than with the 1,2-1,3-arm or 1,4-1,3-arm of a bi- or tri-antennary oligosaccharide chain of N-glycan.</p>

<p>Rice Os7BGlu26 is a GH1 family glycoside hydrolase with a threefold higher kcat/Km value for 4-nitrophenyl β-D-mannoside (4NPMan) compared with 4-nitrophenyl β-D-glucoside (4NPGlc). To investigate its selectivity for β-D-mannoside and β-D-glucoside substrates, the structures of apo Os7BGlu26 at a resolution of 2.20 Å and of Os7BGlu26 with mannose at a resolution of 2.45 Å were elucidated from isomorphous crystals in space group P212121. The (β/α)8-barrel structure is similar to other GH1 family structures, but with a narrower active-site cleft. The Os7BGlu26 structure with D-mannose corresponds to a product complex, with β-D-mannose in the (1)S5 skew-boat conformation. Docking of the (1)S3, (1)S5, (2)SO and (3)S1 pyranose-ring conformations of 4NPMan and 4NPGlc substrates into the active site of Os7BGlu26 indicated that the lowest energies were in the (1)S5 and (1)S3 skew-boat conformations. Comparison of these docked conformers with other rice GH1 structures revealed differences in the residues interacting with the catalytic acid/base between enzymes with and without β-D-mannosidase activity. The mutation of Tyr134 to Trp in Os7BGlu26 resulted in similar kcat/Km values for 4NPMan and 4NPGlc, while mutation of Tyr134 to Phe resulted in a 37-fold higher kcat/Km for 4NPMan than 4NPGlc. Mutation of Cys182 to Thr decreased both the activity and the selectivity for β-D-mannoside. It was concluded that interactions with the catalytic acid/base play a significant role in glycon selection. </p>

<p>The use of substrate analogues as inhibitors provides a way to understand and manipulate enzyme function. Here we report two 1 A resolution crystal structures of liver alcohol dehydrogenase in complex with NADH and two inhibitors: dimethyl sulfoxide and isobutyramide. Both structures present a dynamic state of inhibition. In the dimethyl sulfoxide complex structure, the inhibitor is caught in transition on its way to the active site using a flash-freezing protocol and a cadmium-substituted enzyme. One inhibitor molecule is partly located in the first and partly in the second coordination sphere of the active site metal. A hydroxide ion bound to the active site metal lies close to the pyridine ring of NADH, which is puckered in a twisted boat conformation. The cadmium ion is coordinated by both the hydroxide ion and the inhibitor molecule, providing structural evidence of a coordination switch at the active site metal ion. The structure of the isobutyramide complex reveals the partial formation of an adduct between the isobutyramide inhibitor and NADH. It provides evidence of the contribution of a shift from the keto to the enol tautomer during aldehyde reduction. The different positions of the inhibitors further refine the knowledge of the dynamics of the enzyme mechanism and explain how the crowded active site can facilitate the presence of a substrate and a metal-bound hydroxide ion.</p>

<p>Bacterial β-glucuronidases expressed by the symbiotic intestinal microbiota appear to play important roles in drug-induced epithelial cell toxicity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. For the anticancer drug CPT-11 (irinotecan) and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, it has been shown that removal of the glucuronide moieties from drug metabolites by bacterial β-glucuronidases in the GI lumen can significantly damage the intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, selective disruption of bacterial β-glucuronidases by small molecule inhibitors alleviates these side effects, which, for CPT-11 {7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]}, can be dose limiting. Here we characterize novel microbial β-glucuronidase inhibitors that inhibit Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase in vitro with Ki values between 180 nM and 2 μM, and disrupt the enzyme in E. coli cells, with EC50 values as low as 300 nM. All compounds are selective for E. coli β-glucuronidase without inhibiting purified mammalian β-glucuronidase, and they do not impact the survival of either bacterial or mammalian cells. The 2.8 Å resolution crystal structure of one inhibitor bound to E. coli β-glucuronidase demonstrates that it contacts and orders only a portion of the "bacterial loop" present in microbial, but not mammalian, β-glucuronidases. The most potent compound examined in this group was found to protect mice against CPT-11-induced diarrhea. Taken together, these data advance our understanding of the chemical and structural basis of selective microbial β-glucuronidase inhibition, which may improve human drug efficacy and toxicity. </p>

<p>The crystal structure of the semireduced form of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CPDase) from Arabidopsis thaliana has been solved by molecular replacement and refined at the resolution of 1.8 A. We have previously reported the crystal structure of the native form of this enzyme, whose main target is ADP-ribose 1",2"-cyclic phosphate, a product of the tRNA splicing reaction. CPDase possesses six cysteine residues, four of which are involved in forming two intra-molecular disulfide bridges. One of these bridges, between Cys-104 and Cys-110, is opened in the semireduced CPDase, whereas the other remains intact. This change of the redox state leads to a conformational rearrangement in the loop covering the active site of the protein. While the native structure shows this partially disordered loop in a coil conformation, in the semireduced enzyme the N-terminal lobe of this loop winds up and elongates the preceding alpha-helix. The semireduced state of CPDase also enabled co-crystallization with a putative inhibitor of its enzymatic activity, 2',3'-cyclic uridine vanadate. The ligand is bound within the active site, and the mode of binding is in agreement with the previously proposed enzymatic mechanism. Selected biophysical properties of the oxidized and the semireduced CPDase are also discussed.</p>

<p>N(1)-methyladenine (m(1)A) and N(3)-methylcytosine (m(3)C) are major toxic and mutagenic lesions induced by alkylation in single-stranded DNA. In bacteria and mammals, m(1)A and m(3)C were recently shown to be repaired by AlkB-mediated oxidative demethylation, a direct DNA damage reversal mechanism. No AlkB gene homologues have been identified in Archaea. We report that m(1)A and m(3)C are repaired by the AfAlkA base excision repair glycosylase of Archaeoglobus fulgidus, suggesting a different repair mechanism for these lesions in the third domain of life. In addition, AfAlkA was found to effect a robust excision of 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine. We present a high-resolution crystal structure of AfAlkA, which, together with the characterization of several site-directed mutants, forms a molecular rationalization for the newly discovered base excision activity.</p>

<p>The commitment step to the aspartate pathway of amino acid biosynthesis is the phosphorylation of aspartic acid catalyzed by aspartokinase (AK). Most microorganisms and plants have multiple forms of this enzyme, and many of these isofunctional enzymes are subject to feedback regulation by the end products of the pathway. However, the archeal species Methanococcus jannaschii has only a single, monofunctional form of AK. The substrate l-aspartate binds to this recombinant enzyme in two different orientations, providing the first structural evidence supporting the relaxed regiospecificity previously observed with several alternative substrates of Escherichia coli AK ( Angeles, T. S., Hunsley, J. R., and Viola, R. E. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 799-805 ). Binding of the nucleotide substrate triggers significant domain movements that result in a more compact quaternary structure. In contrast, the highly cooperative binding of the allosteric regulator l-threonine to multiple sites on this dimer of dimers leads to an open enzyme structure. A comparison of these structures supports a mechanism for allosteric regulation in which the domain movements induced by threonine binding causes displacement of the substrates from the enzyme, resulting in a relaxed, inactive conformation.</p>

<p>Many serine proteases are targets for therapeutic intervention because they often play key roles in disease. Small molecule inhibitors of serine proteases with high affinity are especially interesting as they could be used as scaffolds from which to develop drugs selective for protease targets. One such inhibitor is bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane (BABIM), standing out as the best inhibitor of trypsin (by a factor of over 100) in a series of over 60 relatively closely related analogues. By probing the structural basis of inhibition, we discovered, using crystallographic methods, a new mode of high-affinity binding in which a Zn2+ ion is tetrahedrally coordinated between two chelating nitrogens of BABIM and two active site residues, His57 and Ser 195. Zn2+, at subphysiological levels, enhances inhibition by over 10(3)-fold. The distinct Zn2+ coordination geometry implies a strong dependence of affinity on substituents. This unique structural paradigm has enabled development of potent, highly selective, Zn2+-dependent inhibitors of several therapeutically important serine proteases, using a physiologically ubiquitous metal ion.</p>

<p>Many proteins adopt homomeric quaternary structures to support their biological function, including the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway that is ultimately responsible for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids in plants and microorganisms. This enzyme, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS), adopts a variety of different quaternary structures depending on the organism in which it is found. The DAH7PS from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus was previously shown to be tetrameric in its crystalline form, and this quaternary association is confirmed in an improved structure in a different crystal system. This tetramer is also present in solution as revealed by small-angle X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation. This homotetrameric form has two distinct interfaces, both of which bury over 10% each of the surface area of a single monomer. Substitution of Ile for Asp in the hydrophobic region of one interface gives a protein with a remarkable 4-fold higher maximum catalytic rate than the wild-type enzyme. Analytical ultracentrifugation at pH7.5 reveals that the tetrameric form is destabilized; although the protein crystallizes as a tetramer, equilibrium exists between tetrameric and dimeric forms with a dissociation constant of 22 μM. Thus, under the conditions of kinetic assay, the enzyme is primarily dimeric, revealing that the dimeric form is a fully functional catalyst. However, in comparison to the wild-type protein, the thermal stability of the dimeric protein is significantly compromised. Thus, an unusual compromise of enzymatic activity versus stability is observed for this DAH7PS from an organism that favors a hyperthermophilic environment.</p>

<p>Porphobilinogen synthase catalyzes the first committed step of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. In an aldol-like condensation, two molecules of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) form the first pyrrole, porphobilinogen. Newly synthesized analogues of a reaction intermediate of porphobilinogen synthase have been employed in studying the active site and the catalytic mechanism of this early enzyme of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. This study combines structural and kinetic evaluation of the inhibition potency of these inhibitors. In addition, one of the determined protein structures provides for the first time structural evidence of a magnesium ion in the active site. From these results, we can corroborate an earlier postulated enzymatic mechanism that starts with formation of a C-C bond, linking C3 of the A-side ALA to C4 of the P-side ALA through an aldole addition. The obtained data are discussed with respect to the current literature.</p>

<p>The neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) promotes oxidative stress in numerous inflammatory pathologies by producing hypohalous acids. Its inadvertent activity is a prime target for pharmacological control. Previously, salicylhydroxamic acid was reported to be a weak reversible inhibitor of MPO. We aimed to identify related hydroxamates that are good inhibitors of the enzyme. We report on three hydroxamates as the first potent reversible inhibitors of MPO. The chlorination activity of purified MPO was inhibited by 50% by a 5 nm concentration of a trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic hydroxamate, HX1. The hydroxamates were specific for MPO in neutrophils and more potent toward MPO compared with a broad range of redox enzymes and alternative targets. Surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that the strength of binding of hydroxamates to MPO correlated with the degree of enzyme inhibition. The crystal structure of MPO-HX1 revealed that the inhibitor was bound within the active site cavity above the heme and blocked the substrate channel. HX1 was a mixed-type inhibitor of the halogenation activity of MPO with respect to both hydrogen peroxide and halide. Spectral analyses demonstrated that hydroxamates can act variably as substrates for MPO and convert the enzyme to a nitrosyl ferrous intermediate. This property was unrelated to their ability to inhibit MPO. We propose that aromatic hydroxamates bind tightly to the active site of MPO and prevent it from producing hypohalous acids. This mode of reversible inhibition has potential for blocking the activity of MPO and limiting oxidative stress during inflammation. </p>

<p>As regulators of ubiquitous biological processes, serine proteases can cause disease states when inappropriately expressed or regulated, and are thus rational targets for inhibition by drugs. Recently we described a new inhibition mechanism applicable for the development of potent, selective small molecule serine protease inhibitors that recruit physiological Zn2+ to mediate high affinity (sub-nanomolar) binding. To demonstrate some of the structural principles by which the selectivity of Zn2+-mediated serine protease inhibitors can be developed toward or against a particular target, here we determine and describe the structures of thrombin-BABIM-Zn2+, -keto-BABIM-Zn2+, and -hemi-BABIM-Zn2+ (where BABIM is bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane, keto-BABIM is bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane ketone, and hemi-BABIM is (5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)(2-benzimidazolyl)methane), and compare them with the corresponding trypsin-inhibitor-Zn2+ complexes. Inhibitor binding is mediated by a Zn ion tetrahedrally coordinated by two benzimidazole nitrogen atoms of the inhibitor, by N(epsilon2)His57, and by O(gamma)Ser195. The structures of Zn2+-free trypsin-BABIM and -hemi-BABIM were also determined at selected pH values for comparison with the corresponding Zn2+-mediated complexes. To assess some of the physiological parameters important for harnessing Zn2+ as a co-inhibitor, crystal structures at multiple pH and [Zn2+] values were determined for trypsin-keto-BABIM. The Kdvalue of Zn2+ for the binary trypsin-keto-BABIM complex was estimated to be &lt;12 nM at pH 7.06 by crystallographic determination of the occupancy of bound Zn2+ in trypsin-keto-BABIM crystals soaked at this pH in synthetic mother liquor containing inhibitor and 100 nM Zn2+. In synthetic mother liquor saturated in Zn2+, trypsin-bound keto-BABIM is unhydrated at pH 9.00 and 9.93, and has an sp2 hybridized ketone carbon bridging the 5-amidinobenzimidazoles, whereas at pH 7.00 and 8.00 it undergoes hydration and a change in geometry upon addition of water to the bridging carbonyl group. To show how Zn2+ could be recruited as a co-inhibitor of other enzymes, a method was developed for locating in protein crystals Zn2+ binding sites where design of Zn2+-mediated ligands can be attempted. Thus, by soaking trypsin crystals in high concentrations of Zn2+ in the absence of a molecular inhibitor, the site where Zn2+ mediates binding of BABIM and analogs was identified, as well as another Zn2+ binding site.</p>

From these results, we can corroborate an earlier postulated enzymatic mechanism that starts with formation of a C-C bond, linking C3 of the A-side ALA to C4 of the P-side ALA through an aldole addition. The obtained data are discussed with respect to the current literature.</p>

<p>A central challenge in structure-based ligand design is the accurate prediction of binding free energies. Here we apply alchemical free energy calculations in explicit solvent to predict ligand binding in a model cavity in T4 lysozyme. Even in this simple site, there are challenges. We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an RMS error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the RMS error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.</p>

<p>Bacterial phosphopentomutases (PPMs) are alkaline phosphatase superfamily members that interconvert α-D-ribose 5-phosphate (ribose 5-phosphate) and α-D-ribose 1-phosphate (ribose 1-phosphate). We investigated the reaction mechanism of Bacillus cereus PPM using a combination of structural and biochemical studies. Four high resolution crystal structures of B. cereus PPM revealed the active site architecture, identified binding sites for the substrate ribose 5-phosphate and the activator α-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (glucose 1,6-bisphosphate), and demonstrated that glucose 1,6-bisphosphate increased phosphorylation of the active site residue Thr-85. The phosphorylation of Thr-85 was confirmed by Western and mass spectroscopic analyses. Biochemical assays identified Mn(2+)-dependent enzyme turnover and demonstrated that glucose 1,6-bisphosphate treatment increases enzyme activity. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation activates the enzyme, which supports an intermolecular transferase mechanism. We confirmed intermolecular phosphoryl transfer using an isotope relay assay in which PPM reactions containing mixtures of ribose 5-[(18)O(3)]phosphate and [U-(13)C(5)]ribose 5-phosphate were analyzed by mass spectrometry. This intermolecular phosphoryl transfer is seemingly counter to what is anticipated from phosphomutases employing a general alkaline phosphatase reaction mechanism, which are reported to catalyze intramolecular phosphoryl transfer. However, the two mechanisms may be reconciled if substrate encounters the enzyme at a different point in the catalytic cycle.</p>

<p>Lumiracoxib is a substrate-selective inhibitor of endocannabinoid oxygenation by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We assayed a series of lumiracoxib derivatives to identify the structural determinants of substrate-selective inhibition. The hydrogen-bonding potential of the substituents at the ortho positions of the aniline ring dictated the potency and substrate selectivity of the inhibitors. The presence of a 5'-methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring increased the potency of molecules with a single ortho substituent. Des-fluorolumiracoxib (2) was the most potent and selective inhibitor of endocannabinoid oxygenation. The positioning of critical substituents in the binding site was identified from a 2.35Å crystal structure of lumiracoxib bound to COX-2. </p>

<p>C1s is the highly specific modular serine protease that mediates the proteolytic activity of the C1 complex and thereby triggers activation of the complement cascade. The crystal structure of a catalytic fragment from human C1s comprising the second complement control protein (CCP2) module and the chymotrypsin-like serine protease (SP) domain has been determined and refined to 1.7 A resolution. In the areas surrounding the active site, the SP structure reveals a restricted access to subsidiary substrate binding sites that could be responsible for the narrow specificity of C1s. The ellipsoidal CCP2 module is oriented perpendicularly to the surface of the SP domain. This arrangement is maintained through a rigid module-domain interface involving intertwined proline- and tyrosine-rich polypeptide segments. The relative orientation of SP and CCP2 is consistent with the fact that the latter provides additional substrate recognition sites for the C4 substrate. This structure provides a first example of a CCP-SP assembly that is conserved in diverse extracellular proteins. Its implications in the activation mechanism of C1 are discussed.</p>

<p>The development of HIV-1 protease inhibitors has been the historic paradigm of rational structure-based drug design, where structural and thermodynamic analyses have assisted in the discovery of novel inhibitors. While the total enthalpy and entropy change upon binding determine the affinity, often the thermodynamics are considered in terms of inhibitor properties only. In the current study, profound changes are observed in the binding thermodynamics of a drug-resistant variant compared to wild-type HIV-1 protease, irrespective of the inhibitor bound. This variant (Flap+) has a combination of flap and active site mutations and exhibits extremely large entropy-enthalpy compensation compared to wild-type protease, 5-15 kcal/mol, while losing only 1-3 kcal/mol in total binding free energy for any of six FDA-approved inhibitors. Although entropy-enthalpy compensation has been previously observed for a variety of systems, never have changes of this magnitude been reported. The co-crystal structures of Flap+ protease with four of the inhibitors were determined and compared with complexes of both the wild-type protease and another drug-resistant variant that does not exhibit this energetic compensation. Structural changes conserved across the Flap+ complexes, which are more pronounced for the flaps covering the active site, likely contribute to the thermodynamic compensation. The finding that drug-resistant mutations can profoundly modulate the relative thermodynamic properties of a therapeutic target independent of the inhibitor presents a new challenge for rational drug design.</p>

<p>Bacterial resistance to antibiotic therapies is increasing and new treatment options are badly needed. There is an overlap between these resistant bacteria and organisms classified as likely bioterror weapons. For example, Bacillus anthracis is innately resistant to the anti-folate trimethoprim due to sequence changes found in the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Development of new inhibitors provides an opportunity to enhance the current arsenal of anti-folate antibiotics while also expanding the coverage of the anti-folate class.</p>

<p>The common reactions of dioxygen, superoxide, and hydroperoxides with thiolates are thought to proceed via persulfenate intermediates, yet these have never been visualized. Here we report a 1.4 A resolution crystal structure of the Fe(2+)-dependent enzyme cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) containing this putative intermediate trapped in its active site pocket. The complex raises the possibility that, distinct from known dioxygenases and proposed CDO mechanisms, the Fe-proximal oxygen atom may be involved in the primary oxidation event yielding a unique three-membered Fe-S-O cyclic intermediate. A nonpolar environment of the distal oxygen would facilitate isomerization of the persulfenate to the sulfinate product.</p>

<p>High-throughput structure determination of protein-ligand complexes is central in drug development and structural proteomics. To facilitate such high-throughput structure determination we designed an induced replacement strategy. Crystals of a protein complex bound to a photosensitive ligand are exposed to UV light, inducing the departure of the bound ligand, allowing a new ligand to soak in. We exemplify the approach for a class of protein complexes that is especially recalcitrant to high-throughput strategies: the MHC class I proteins. We developed a UV-sensitive, "conditional", peptide ligand whose UV-induced cleavage in the crystals leads to the exchange of the low-affinity lytic fragments for full-length peptides introduced in the crystallant solution. This "in crystallo" exchange is monitored by the loss of seleno-methionine anomalous diffraction signal of the conditional peptide compared to the signal of labeled MHC beta2m subunit. This method has the potential to facilitate high-throughput crystallography in various protein families.</p>

<p>A thermostable quorum-quenching lactonase from Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426 (GI: 56420041) was used as an initial template for in vitro directed evolution experiments. This enzyme belongs to the phosphotriesterase-like lactonase (PLL) group of enzymes within the amidohydrolase superfamily that hydrolyze N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) that are involved in virulence pathways of quorum-sensing pathogenic bacteria. Here we have determined the N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone-liganded structure of the catalytically inactive D266N mutant of this enzyme to a resolution of 1.6 Å. Using a tunable, bioluminescence-based quorum-quenching molecular circuit, the catalytic efficiency was enhanced, and the AHL substrate range increased through two point mutations on the loops at the C-terminal ends of the third and seventh β-strands. This E101N/R230I mutant had an increased value of k(cat)/K(m) of 72-fold toward 3-oxo-N-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone. The evolved mutant also exhibited lactonase activity toward N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone, an AHL that was previously not hydrolyzed by the wild-type enzyme. Both the purified wild-type and mutant enzymes contain a mixture of zinc and iron and are colored purple and brown, respectively, at high concentrations. The origin of this coloration is suggested to be because of a charge transfer complex involving the β-cation and Tyr-99 within the enzyme active site. Modulation of the charge transfer complex alters the lactonase activity of the mutant enzymes and is reflected in enzyme coloration changes. We attribute the observed enhancement in catalytic reactivity of the evolved enzyme to favorable modulations of the active site architecture toward productive geometries required for chemical catalysis.</p>

<p>Aromatic amine dehydrogenase uses a tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor to oxidatively deaminate primary aromatic amines. In the reductive half-reaction, a proton is transferred from the substrate C1 to betaAsp-128 O-2, in a reaction that proceeds by H-tunneling. Using solution studies, kinetic crystallography, and computational simulation we show that the mechanism of oxidation of aromatic carbinolamines is similar to amine oxidation, but that carbinolamine oxidation occurs at a substantially reduced rate. This has enabled us to determine for the first time the structure of the intermediate prior to the H-transfer/reduction step. The proton-betaAsp-128 O-2 distance is approximately 3.7A, in contrast to the distance of approximately 2.7A predicted for the intermediate formed with the corresponding primary amine substrate. This difference of approximately 1.0 A is due to an unexpected conformation of the substrate moiety, which is supported by molecular dynamic simulations and reflected in the approximately 10(7)-fold slower TTQ reduction rate with phenylaminoethanol compared with that with primary amines. A water molecule is observed near TTQ C-6 and is likely derived from the collapse of the preceding carbinolamine TTQ-adduct. We suggest this water molecule is involved in consecutive proton transfers following TTQ reduction, and is ultimately repositioned near the TTQ O-7 concomitant with protein rearrangement. For all carbinolamines tested, highly stable amide-TTQ adducts are formed following proton abstraction and TTQ reduction. Slow hydrolysis of the amide occurs after, rather than prior to, TTQ oxidation and leads ultimately to a carboxylic acid product.</p>

<p>Numerous 2'-deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) that are functionalized with spacious modifications such as dyes and affinity tags like biotin are substrates for DNA polymerases. They are widely employed in many cutting-edge technologies like advanced DNA sequencing approaches, microarrays, and single molecule techniques. Modifications attached to the nucleobase are accepted by many DNA polymerases, and thus, dNTPs bearing nucleobase modifications are predominantly employed. When pyrimidines are used the modifications are almost exclusively at the C5 position to avoid disturbing of Watson-Crick base pairing ability. However, the detailed molecular mechanism by which C5 modifications are processed by a DNA polymerase is poorly understood. Here, we present the first crystal structures of a DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus processing two C5 modified substrates that are accepted by the enzyme with different efficiencies. The structures were obtained as ternary complex of the enzyme bound to primer/template duplex with the respective modified dNTP in position poised for catalysis leading to incorporation. Thus, the study provides insights into the incorporation mechanism of the modified nucleotides elucidating how bulky modifications are accepted by the enzyme. The structures show a varied degree of perturbation of the enzyme substrate complexes depending on the nature of the modifications suggesting design principles for future developments of modified substrates for DNA polymerases.</p>

<p>Homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase from Brevibacterium fuscum (HPCD) has an Fe(II) center in its active site that can be replaced with Mn(II) or Co(II). Whereas Mn-HPCD exhibits steady-state kinetic parameters comparable to those of Fe-HPCD, Co-HPCD behaves somewhat differently, exhibiting significantly higher [Formula: see text] and k (cat). The high activity of Co-HPCD is surprising, given that cobalt has the highest standard M(III/II) redox potential of the three metals. Comparison of the X-ray crystal structures of the resting and substrate-bound forms of Fe-HPCD, Mn-HPCD, and Co-HPCD shows that metal substitution has no effect on the local ligand environment, the conformational integrity of the active site, or the overall protein structure, suggesting that the protein structure does not differentially tune the potential of the metal center. Analysis of the steady-state kinetics of Co-HPCD suggests that the Co(II) center alters the relative rate constants for the interconversion of intermediates in the catalytic cycle but still allows the dioxygenase reaction to proceed efficiently. When compared with the kinetic data for Fe-HPCD and Mn-HPCD, these results show that dioxygenase catalysis can proceed at high rates over a wide range of metal redox potentials. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism in which the metal mediates electron transfer between the catechol substrate and O(2) to form the postulated [M(II)(semiquinone)superoxo] reactive species. These kinetic differences and the spectroscopic properties of Co-HPCD provide new tools with which to explore the unique O(2) activation mechanism associated with the extradiol dioxygenase family.</p>

<p>Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) is an essential enzyme in (S)-lysine biosynthesis and an important antibiotic target. All X-ray crystal structures solved to date reveal a homotetrameric enzyme. In order to explore the role of this quaternary structure, dimeric variants of Escherichia coli DHDPS were engineered and their properties were compared to those of the wild-type tetrameric form. X-ray crystallography reveals that the active site is not disturbed when the quaternary structure is disrupted. However, the activity of the dimeric enzymes in solution is substantially reduced, and a tetrahedral adduct of a substrate analogue is observed to be trapped at the active site in the crystal form. Remarkably, heating the dimeric enzymes increases activity. We propose that the homotetrameric structure of DHDPS reduces dynamic fluctuations present in the dimeric forms and increases specificity for the first substrate, pyruvate. By restricting motion in a key catalytic motif, a competing, non-productive reaction with a substrate analogue is avoided. Small-angle X-ray scattering and mutagenesis data, together with a B-factor analysis of the crystal structures, support this hypothesis and lead to the suggestion that in at least some cases, the evolution of quaternary enzyme structures might serve to optimise the dynamic properties of the protein subunits.</p>

<p>Kre2p/Mnt1p is a Golgi alpha1,2-mannosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall glycoproteins. The protein belongs to glycosyltransferase family 15, a member of which has been implicated in virulence of Candida albicans. We present the 2.0 A crystal structures of the catalytic domain of Kre2p/Mnt1p and its binary and ternary complexes with GDP/Mn(2+) and GDP/Mn(2+)/acceptor methyl-alpha-mannoside. The protein has a mixed alpha/beta fold similar to the glycosyltransferase-A (GT-A) fold. Although the GDP-mannose donor was used in the crystallization experiments and the GDP moiety is bound tightly to the active site, the mannose is not visible in the electron density. The manganese is coordinated by a modified DXD motif (EPD), with only the first glutamate involved in a direct interaction. The position of the donor mannose was modeled using the binary and ternary complexes of other GT-A enzymes. The C1" of the modeled donor mannose is within hydrogen-bonding distance of both the hydroxyl of Tyr(220) and the O2 of the acceptor mannose. The O2 of the acceptor mannose is also within hydrogen bond distance of the hydroxyl of Tyr(220). The structures, modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analysis suggest two possible catalytic mechanisms. Either a double-displacement mechanism with the hydroxyl of Tyr(220) as the potential nucleophile or alternatively, an S(N)i-like mechanism with Tyr(220) positioning the substrates for catalysis. The importance of Tyr(220) in both mechanisms is highlighted by a 3000-fold reduction in k(cat) in the Y220F mutant.</p>

<p>Clinical inhibitor amprenavir (APV) is less effective on HIV-2 protease (PR₂) than on HIV-1 protease (PR₁). We solved the crystal structure of PR₂ with APV at 1.5 Å resolution to identify structural changes associated with the lowered inhibition. Furthermore, we analyzed the PR₁ mutant (PR(1M) ) with substitutions V32I, I47V, and V82I that mimic the inhibitor binding site of PR₂. PR(1M) more closely resembled PR₂ than PR₁ in catalytic efficiency on four substrate peptides and inhibition by APV, whereas few differences were seen for two other substrates and inhibition by saquinavir (SQV) and darunavir (DRV). High resolution crystal structures of PR(1M) with APV, DRV, and SQV were compared with available PR₁ and PR₂ complexes. Val/Ile32 and Ile/Val47 showed compensating interactions with SQV in PR(1M) and PR₁, however, Ile82 interacted with a second SQV bound in an extension of the active site cavity of PR(1M). Residues 32 and 82 maintained similar interactions with DRV and APV in all the enzymes, whereas Val47 and Ile47 had opposing effects in the two subunits. Significantly diminished interactions were seen for the aniline of APV bound in PR₁ (M) and PR₂ relative to the strong hydrogen bonds observed in PR₁, consistent with 15- and 19-fold weaker inhibition, respectively. Overall, PR(1M) partially replicates the specificity of PR₂ and gives insight into drug resistant mutations at residues 32, 47, and 82. Moreover, this analysis provides a structural explanation for the weaker antiviral effects of APV on HIV-2.</p>

<p>Photosynthesis uses chlorophylls for the conversion of light into chemical energy, the driving force of life on Earth. During chlorophyll biosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, green algae and gymnosperms, dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR), a nitrogenase-like metalloenzyme, catalyzes the chemically challenging two-electron reduction of the fully conjugated ring system of protochlorophyllide a. The reduction of the C-17=C-18 double bond results in the characteristic ring architecture of all chlorophylls, thereby altering the absorption properties of the molecule and providing the basis for light-capturing and energy-transduction processes of photosynthesis. We report the X-ray crystallographic structure of the substrate-bound, ADP-aluminium fluoride-stabilized (ADP·AlF(3)-stabilized) transition state complex between the DPOR components L(2) and (NB)(2) from the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus. Our analysis permits a thorough investigation of the dynamic interplay between L(2) and (NB)(2). Upon complex formation, substantial ATP-dependent conformational rearrangements of L(2) trigger the protein-protein interactions with (NB)(2) as well as the electron transduction via redox-active [4Fe-4S] clusters. We also present the identification of artificial "small-molecule substrates" of DPOR in correlation with those of nitrogenase. The catalytic differences and similarities between DPOR and nitrogenase have broad implications for the energy transduction mechanism of related multiprotein complexes that are involved in the reduction of chemically stable double and/or triple bonds.</p>

<p>N-Acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK) catalyses the second step in the route of arginine biosynthesis. In many organisms this enzyme is inhibited by the final product of the route, arginine, and thus plays a central regulatory role. In addition, in photosynthetic organisms NAGK is the target of the nitrogen-signalling protein PII. The 3-D structure of homodimeric, arginine-insensitive, Escherichia coli NAGK, clarified substrate binding and catalysis but shed no light on arginine inhibition of NAGK. We now shed light on arginine inhibition by determining the crystal structures, at 2.75 A and 2.95 A resolution, of arginine-complexed Thermotoga maritima and arginine-free Pseudomonas aeruginosa NAGKs, respectively. Both enzymes are highly similar ring-like hexamers having a central orifice of approximately 30 A diameter. They are formed by linking three E.coli NAGK-like homodimers through the interlacing of an N-terminal mobile kinked alpha-helix, which is absent from E.coli NAGK. Arginine is bound in each subunit of T.maritima NAGK, flanking the interdimeric junction, in a site formed between the N helix and the C lobe of the subunit. This site is also present, in variable conformations, in P.aeruginosa NAGK, but is missing from E.coli NAGK. Arginine, by gluing the C lobe of each subunit to the inter-dimeric junction, may stabilize an enlarged active centre conformation, hampering catalysis. Acetylglutamate counters arginine inhibition by promoting active centre closure. The hexameric architecture justifies the observed sigmoidal arginine inhibition kinetics with a high Hill coefficient (N approximately 4), and appears essential for arginine inhibition and for NAGK-PII complex formation, since this complex may involve binding of NAGK and PII with their 3-fold axes aligned. The NAGK structures allow identification of diagnostic sequence signatures for arginine inhibition. These signatures are found also in the homologous arginine-inhibited enzyme NAG synthase. The findings on NAGK shed light on the structure, function and arginine inhibition of this synthase, for which a hexameric model is constructed.</p>

<p>The molecular interactions between the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and two compound classes consisting of N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]benzenesulfonamides and N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]benzenemethanesulfonamides have been investigated using organic synthesis, enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography, and thermodynamic profiling. The inhibitors' aromatic properties were varied to establish structure-activity relationships (SAR) between the inhibitors and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The two structurally similar compound classes proved to have distinctly divergent SARs in terms of their inhibition capacity of AChE. Eight X-ray structures revealed that the two sets have different conformations in PAS. Furthermore, thermodynamic profiles of the binding between compounds and AChE revealed class-dependent differences of the entropy/enthalpy contributions to the free energy of binding. Further development of the entropy-favored compound class resulted in the synthesis of the most potent inhibitor and an extension beyond the established SARs. The divergent SARs will be utilized to develop reversible inhibitors of AChE into reactivators of nerve agent-inhibited AChE. </p>

<p>Compound 15 (SAR107375), a novel potent dual thrombin and factor Xa inhibitor resulted from a rational optimization process. Starting from compound 14, with low factor Xa and modest anti-thrombin inhibitory activities (IC50's of 3.5 and 0.39 μM, respectively), both activities were considerably improved, notably through the incorporation of a neutral chlorothiophene P1 fragment and tuning of P2 and P3-P4 fragments. Final optimization of metabolic stability with microsomes led to the identification of 15, which displays strong activity in vitro vs factor Xa and thrombin (with Ki's of 1 and 8 nM, respectively). In addition 15 presents good selectivity versus related serine proteases (roughly 300-fold), including trypsin (1000-fold), and is very active (0.39 μM) in the thrombin generation time (TGT) coagulation assay in human platelet rich plasma (PRP). Potent in vivo activity in a rat model of venous thrombosis following iv and, more importantly, po administration was also observed (ED50 of 0.07 and 2.8 mg/kg, respectively). Bleeding liability was reduced in the rat wire coil model, more relevant to arterial thrombosis, with 15 (blood loss increase of 2-fold relative to the ED80 value) compared to rivaroxaban 2 and dabigatran etexilate 1a. </p>

<p>Crystal structures of divalent metal-dependent pyruvate aldolase, HpaI, in complex with substrate and cleavage products were determined to 1.8-2.0 Å resolution. The enzyme·substrate complex with 4-hydroxy-2-ketoheptane-1,7-dioate indicates that water molecule W2 bound to the divalent metal ion initiates C3-C4 bond cleavage. The binding mode of the aldehyde donor delineated a solvent-filled capacious binding locus lined with predominantly hydrophobic residues. The absence of direct interactions with the aldehyde aliphatic carbons accounts for the broad specificity and lack of stereospecific control by the enzyme. Enzymatic complex structures formed with keto acceptors, pyruvate, and 2-ketobutyrate revealed bidentate interaction with the divalent metal ion by C1-carboxyl and C2-carbonyl oxygens and water molecule W4 that is within close contact of the C3 carbon. Arg(70) assumes a multivalent role through its guanidinium moiety interacting with all active site enzymatic species: C2 oxygen in substrate, pyruvate, and ketobutyrate; substrate C4 hydroxyl; aldehyde C1 oxygen; and W4. The multiple interactions made by Arg(70) stabilize the negatively charged C4 oxygen following proton abstraction, the aldehyde alignment in aldol condensation, and the pyruvate enolate upon aldol cleavage as well as support proton exchange at C3. This role is corroborated by loss of aldol cleavage ability and pyruvate C3 proton exchange activity and by a 730-fold increase in the dissociation constant toward the pyruvate enolate analog oxalate in the R70A mutant. Based on the crystal structures, a mechanism is proposed involving the two enzyme-bound water molecules, W2 and W4, in acid/base catalysis that facilitates reversible aldol cleavage. The same reaction mechanism promotes decarboxylation of oxaloacetate.</p>

<p>Anaerobic CO dehydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2 at a complex Ni-, Fe-, and S-containing metal center called cluster C. We report crystal structures of CO dehydrogenase II from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans in three different states. In a reduced state, exogenous CO2 supplied in solution is bound and reductively activated by cluster C. In the intermediate structure, CO2 acts as a bridging ligand between Ni and the asymmetrically coordinated Fe, where it completes the square-planar coordination of the Ni ion. It replaces a water/hydroxo ligand bound to the Fe ion in the other two states. The structures define the mechanism of CO oxidation and CO2 reduction at the Ni-Fe site of cluster C.</p>

The multiple interactions made by Arg(70) stabilize the negatively charged C4 oxygen following proton abstraction, the aldehyde alignment in aldol condensation, and the pyruvate enolate upon aldol cleavage as well as support proton exchange at C3. This role is corroborated by loss of aldol cleavage ability and pyruvate C3 proton exchange activity and by a 730-fold increase in the dissociation constant toward the pyruvate enolate analog oxalate in the R70A mutant. Based on the crystal structures, a mechanism is proposed involving the two enzyme-bound water molecules, W2 and W4, in acid/base catalysis that facilitates reversible aldol cleavage. The same reaction mechanism promotes decarboxylation of oxaloacetate.</p>

<p>Anaerobic CO dehydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2 at a complex Ni-, Fe-, and S-containing metal center called cluster C. We report crystal structures of CO dehydrogenase II from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans in three different states. In a reduced state, exogenous CO2 supplied in solution is bound and reductively activated by cluster C. In the intermediate structure, CO2 acts as a bridging ligand between Ni and the asymmetrically coordinated Fe, where it completes the square-planar coordination of the Ni ion. It replaces a water/hydroxo ligand bound to the Fe ion in the other two states. The structures define the mechanism of CO oxidation and CO2 reduction at the Ni-Fe site of cluster C.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of divalent metal-dependent pyruvate aldolase, HpaI, in complex with substrate and cleavage products were determined to 1.8-2.0 Å resolution. The enzyme·substrate complex with 4-hydroxy-2-ketoheptane-1,7-dioate indicates that water molecule W2 bound to the divalent metal ion initiates C3-C4 bond cleavage. The binding mode of the aldehyde donor delineated a solvent-filled capacious binding locus lined with predominantly hydrophobic residues. The absence of direct interactions with the aldehyde aliphatic carbons accounts for the broad specificity and lack of stereospecific control by the enzyme. Enzymatic complex structures formed with keto acceptors, pyruvate, and 2-ketobutyrate revealed bidentate interaction with the divalent metal ion by C1-carboxyl and C2-carbonyl oxygens and water molecule W4 that is within close contact of the C3 carbon.

<p>Fructansucrases (FSs) catalyze a transfructosylation reaction with sucrose as substrate to produce fructo-oligosaccharides and fructan polymers that contain either β-2,1 glycosidic linkages (inulin) or β-2,6 linkages (levan). Levan-synthesizing FSs (levansucrases) have been most extensively investigated, while detailed information on inulosucrases is limited. Importantly, the molecular basis of the different product specificities of levansucrases and inulosucrases is poorly understood. We have elucidated the three-dimensional structure of a truncated active bacterial GH68 inulosucrase, InuJ of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC533 (residues 145-708), in its apo form, with a bound substrate (sucrose), and with a transfructosylation product. The sucrose binding pocket and the sucrose binding mode are virtually identical with those of GH68 levansucrases, confirming that both enzyme types use the same fully conserved structural framework for the binding and cleavage of the donor substrate sucrose in the active site. The binding mode of the first transfructosylation product 1-kestose (Fru-β(2-1)-Fru-α(2-1)-Glc, where Fru=fructose and Glc=glucose) in subsites -1 to +2 shows for the first time how inulin-type fructo-oligosaccharide bind in GH68 FS and how an inulin-type linkage can be formed. Surprisingly, observed interactions with the sugar in subsites +1 and +2 are provided by residues that are also present in levansucrases. The binding mode of 1-kestose and the presence of a more distant sucrose binding site suggest that residues beyond the +2 subsite, in particular residues from the nonconserved 1B-1C loop, determine product linkage type specificity in GH68 FSs.</p>

<p>α-Galactosides are non-digestible carbohydrates widely distributed in plants. They are a potential source of energy in our daily food, and their assimilation by microbiota may play a role in obesity. In the intestinal tract, they are degraded by microbial glycosidases, which are often modular enzymes with catalytic domains linked to carbohydrate-binding modules. Here we introduce a bifunctional enzyme from the human intestinal bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus E1, α-galactosidase/sucrose kinase (AgaSK). Sequence analysis showed that AgaSK is composed of two domains: one closely related to α-galactosidases from glycoside hydrolase family GH36 and the other containing a nucleotide-binding motif. Its biochemical characterization showed that AgaSK is able to hydrolyze melibiose and raffinose to galactose and either glucose or sucrose, respectively, and to specifically phosphorylate sucrose on the C6 position of glucose in the presence of ATP. The production of sucrose-6-P directly from raffinose points toward a glycolytic pathway in bacteria, not described so far. The crystal structures of the galactosidase domain in the apo form and in complex with the product shed light onto the reaction and substrate recognition mechanisms and highlight an oligomeric state necessary for efficient substrate binding and suggesting a cross-talk between the galactose and kinase domains.</p>

<p>The structural elucidation of membrane proteins continues to gather pace, but we know little about their molecular interactions with the lipid environment or how they interact with the surrounding bilayer. Here, with the aid of low-resolution X-ray crystallography, we present direct structural information on membrane interfaces as delineated by lipid phosphate groups surrounding the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in its phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Ca(2+)-free forms. The protein-lipid interactions are further analysed using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that SERCA adapts to membranes of different hydrophobic thicknesses by inducing local deformations in the lipid bilayers and by undergoing small rearrangements of the amino-acid side chains and helix tilts. These mutually adaptive interactions allow smooth transitions through large conformational changes associated with the transport cycle of SERCA, a strategy that may be of general nature for many membrane proteins.</p>

<p>Rieske-type oxygenases are promising biocatalysts for the destruction of persistent pollutants or for the synthesis of fine chemicals. In this work, we explored pathways through which Rieske-type oxygenases evolve to expand their substrate range. BphAE(p4), a variant biphenyl dioxygenase generated from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 BphAE(LB400) by the double substitution T335A/F336M, and BphAE(RR41), obtained by changing Asn(338), Ile(341), and Leu(409) of BphAE(p4) to Gln(338), Val(341), and Phe(409), metabolize dibenzofuran two and three times faster than BphAE(LB400), respectively. Steady-state kinetic measurements of single- and multiple-substitution mutants of BphAE(LB400) showed that the single T335A and the double N338Q/L409F substitutions contribute significantly to enhanced catalytic activity toward dibenzofuran. Analysis of crystal structures showed that the T335A substitution relieves constraints on a segment lining the catalytic cavity, allowing a significant displacement in response to dibenzofuran binding. The combined N338Q/L409F substitutions alter substrate-induced conformational changes of protein groups involved in subunit assembly and in the chemical steps of the reaction. This suggests a responsive induced fit mechanism that retunes the alignment of protein atoms involved in the chemical steps of the reaction. These enzymes can thus expand their substrate range through mutations that alter the constraints or plasticity of the catalytic cavity to accommodate new substrates or that alter the induced fit mechanism required to achieve proper alignment of reaction-critical atoms or groups.</p>

<p>The biphenyl dioxygenase of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (BphAE(LB400)) is a Rieske-type oxygenase that catalyzes the stereospecific oxygenation of many heterocyclic aromatics including dibenzofuran. In a previous work, we evolved BphAE(LB400) and obtained BphAE(RR41). This variant metabolizes dibenzofuran and 2-chlorodibenzofuran more efficiently than BphAE(LB400). However, the regiospecificity of BphAE(RR41) toward these substrates differs. Dibenzofuran is metabolized principally through a lateral dioxygenation whereas 2-chlorodibenzofuran is metabolized principally through an angular dioxygenation. In order to explain this difference, we examined the crystal structures of both substrate-bound forms of BphAE(RR41) obtained under anaerobic conditions. This structure analysis, in combination with biochemical data for a Ser283Gly mutant provided evidences that the substrate is compelled to move after oxygen-binding in BphAE(RR41):dibenzofuran. In BphAE(RR41):2-chlorodibenzofuran, the chlorine atom is close to the side chain of Ser283. This contact is missing in the BphAE(RR41):dibenzofuran, and strong enough in the BphAE(RR41):2-chlorodibenzofuran to help prevent substrate movement during the catalytic reaction.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of AzoR (azoreductase) has been determined in complex with FMN for two different crystal forms at 1.8 and 2.2 A resolution. AzoR is an oxidoreductase isolated from Escherichia coli as a protein responsible for the degradation of azo compounds. This enzyme is an FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase and catalyzes the reductive cleavage of azo groups by a ping-pong mechanism. The structure suggests that AzoR acts in a homodimeric state forming the two identical catalytic sites to which both monomers contribute. The structure revealed that each monomer of AzoR has a flavodoxin-like structure, without the explicit overall amino acid sequence homology. Superposition of the structures from the two different crystal forms revealed the conformational change and suggested a mechanism for accommodating substrates of different size. Furthermore, comparison of the active site structure with that of NQO1 complexed with substrates provides clues to the possible substrate-binding mechanism of AzoR.</p>

<p>Tri-o-cresyl-phosphate (TOCP) is a common additive in jet engine lubricants and hydraulic fluids suspected to have a role in aerotoxic syndrome in humans. TOCP is metabolized to cresyl saligenin phosphate (CBDP), a potent irreversible inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a natural bioscavenger present in the bloodstream, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the off-switch at cholinergic synapses. Mechanistic details of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition have, however, remained elusive. Also, the inhibition of AChE by CBDP is unexpected, from a structural standpoint, i.e., considering the narrowness of AChE active site and the bulkiness of CBDP. In the following, we report on kinetic X-ray crystallography experiments that provided 2.7-3.3 Å snapshots of the reaction of CBDP with mouse AChE and human BChE. The series of crystallographic snapshots reveals that AChE and BChE react with the opposite enantiomers and that an induced-fit rearrangement of Phe297 enlarges the active site of AChE upon CBDP binding. Mass spectrometry analysis of aging in either H(2)(16)O or H(2)(18)O furthermore allowed us to identify the inhibition steps, in which water molecules are involved, thus providing insights into the mechanistic details of inhibition. X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry show the formation of an aged end product formed in both AChE and BChE that cannot be reactivated by current oxime-based therapeutics. Our study thus shows that only prophylactic and symptomatic treatments are viable to counter the inhibition of AChE and BChE by CBDP.</p>

<p>D-Xylulokinase (XK; EC 2.7.1.17) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of d-xylulose (Xu) to produce xylulose 5-phosphate (Xu5P). In mammals, XK is the last enzyme in the glucuronate-xylulose pathway, active in the liver and kidneys, and is linked through its product Xu5P to the pentose-phosphate pathway. XK may play an important role in metabolic disease, given that Xu5P is a key regulator of glucose metabolism and lipogenesis. We have expressed the product of a putative human XK gene and identified it as the authentic human d-xylulokinase (hXK). NMR studies with a variety of sugars showed that hXK acts only on d-xylulose, and a coupled photometric assay established its key kinetic parameters as K(m)(Xu) = 24 ± 3 μm and k(cat) = 35 ± 5 s(-1). Crystal structures were determined for hXK, on its own and in complexes with Xu, ADP, and a fluorinated inhibitor. These reveal that hXK has a two-domain fold characteristic of the sugar kinase/hsp70/actin superfamily, with glycerol kinase as its closest relative. Xu binds to domain-I and ADP to domain-II, but in this open form of hXK they are 10 Å apart, implying that a large scale conformational change is required for catalysis. Xu binds in its linear keto-form, sandwiched between a Trp side chain and polar side chains that provide exquisite hydrogen bonding recognition. The hXK structure provides a basis for the design of specific inhibitors with which to probe its roles in sugar metabolism and metabolic disease.</p>

<p>The cytochrome bc1 is one of the three major respiratory enzyme complexes residing in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Cytochrome bc1 transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and uses the energy thus released to form an electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane. Our X-ray crystal structures of the complex from chicken, cow and rabbit in both the presence and absence of inhibitors of quinone oxidation, reveal two different locations for the extrinsic domain of one component of the enzyme, an iron-sulphur protein. One location is close enough to the supposed quinol oxidation site to allow reduction of the Fe-S protein by ubiquinol. The other site is close enough to cytochrome c1 to allow oxidation of the Fe-S protein by the cytochrome. As neither location will allow both reactions to proceed at a suitable rate, the reaction mechanism must involve movement of the extrinsic domain of the Fe-S component in order to shuttle electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c1. Such a mechanism has not previously been observed in redox protein complexes.</p>

<p>Cancer cells often have a high demand for antiapoptotic proteins in order to resist programmed cell death. CDK9 inhibition selectively targets survival proteins and reinstates apoptosis in cancer cells. We designed a series of 4-thiazol-2-anilinopyrimidine derivatives with functional groups attached to the C5-position of the pyrimidine or to the C4-thiazol moiety and investigated their effects on CDK9 potency and selectivity. One of the most selective compounds, 12u inhibits CDK9 with IC(50) = 7 nM and shows over 80-fold selectivity for CDK9 versus CDK2. X-ray crystal structures of 12u bound to CDK9 and CDK2 provide insights into the binding modes. This work, together with crystal structures of selected inhibitors in complex with both enzymes described in a companion paper, (34)  provides a rationale for the observed SAR. 12u demonstrates potent anticancer activity against primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with a therapeutic window 31- and 107-fold over those of normal B- and T-cells.</p>

<p>The structure of human aldose reductase in complex with the 2 S4 R stereoisomer of the potent inhibitor Fidarestat ((2 S,4 S)-6-fluoro-2',5'-dioxospiro-[chroman-4,4'-imidazoline]-2-carboxamide) was determined at 15 K and a resolution of 0.78 A. The structure of the complex provides experimental evidence for the inhibition mechanism in which Fidarestat is initially bound neutral and then becomes negatively charged by donating the proton at the 1'-position nitrogen of the cyclic imide ring to the N2 atom of the catalytic His110.</p>

<p>Using site-directed mutagenesis we have investigated the catalytic residues in a xylanase from Bacillus circulans. Analysis of the mutants E78D and E172D indicated that mutations in these conserved residues do not grossly alter the structure of the enzyme and that these residues participate in the catalytic mechanism. We have now determined the crystal structure of an enzyme-substrate complex to 108 A resolution using a catalytically incompetent mutant (E172C). In addition to the catalytic residues, Glu 78 and Glu 172, we have identified 2 tyrosine residues, Tyr 69 and Tyr 80, which likely function in substrate binding, and an arginine residue, Arg 112, which plays an important role in the active site of this enzyme. On the basis of our work we would propose that Glu 78 is the nucleophile and that Glu 172 is the acid-base catalyst in the reaction.</p>

<p>The crystal structures of the monoclinic and trigonal forms of the quadruple mutant K53,56,120,121M of recombinant bovine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) have been solved and refined at 1.9 and 1.1 A resolution, respectively. Interestingly, the monoclinic form reveals the presence of the second calcium ion. Furthermore, the surface-loop residues are ordered and the conformation of residues 62-66 is similar to that observed in other structures containing the second calcium ion. On the other hand, in the trigonal form the surface loop is disordered and the second calcium is absent. Docking studies suggest that the second calcium and residues Lys62 and Asp66 from the surface loop could be involved in the interaction with the polar head group of the membrane phospholipid. It is hypothesized that the two structures of the quadruple mutant, monoclinic and trigonal, represent the conformations of PLA2 at the lipid interface and in solution, respectively. A docked structure with a phospholipid molecule and with a transition-state analogue bound, one at the active site coordinating to the catalytic calcium and the other at the second calcium site, but both at the i-face, is presented.</p>

<p>Cyclin-dependent kinase 9/cyclin T, the protein kinase heterodimer that constitutes positive transcription elongation factor b, is a well-validated target for treatment of several diseases, including cancer and cardiac hypertrophy. In order to aid inhibitor design and rationalize the basis for CDK9 selectivity, we have studied the CDK-binding properties of six different members of a 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile series that bind to both CDK9/cyclin T and CDK2/cyclin A. We find that for a given CDK, the melting temperature of a CDK/cyclin/inhibitor complex correlates well with inhibitor potency, suggesting that differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a useful orthogonal measure of inhibitory activity for this series. We have used DSF to demonstrate that the binding of these compounds is independent of the presence or absence of the C-terminal tail region of CDK9, unlike the binding of the CDK9-selective inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazone-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (DRB). Finally, on the basis of 11 cocrystal structures bound to CDK9/cyclin T or CDK2/cyclin A, we conclude that selective inhibition of CDK9/cyclin T by members of the 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile series results from the relative malleability of the CDK9 active site rather than from the formation of specific polar contacts.</p>

<p>Argininosuccinate synthetase reversibly catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of a citrulline with an aspartate to give argininosuccinate. The structures of the enzyme from Thermus thermophilus HB8 complexed with intact ATP and substrates (citrulline and aspartate) and with AMP and product (argininosuccinate) have been determined at 2.1- and 2.0-A resolution, respectively. The enzyme does not show the ATP-induced domain rotation observed in the enzyme from Escherichia coli. In the enzyme-substrate complex, the reaction sites of ATP and the bound substrates are adjacent and are sufficiently close for the reaction to proceed without the large conformational change at the domain level. The mobility of the triphosphate group in ATP and the side chain of citrulline play an important role in the catalytic action. The protonated amino group of the bound aspartate interacts with the alpha-phosphate of ATP and the ureido group of citrulline, thus stimulating the adenylation of citrulline. The enzyme-product complex explains how the citrullyl-AMP intermediate is bound to the active site. The stereochemistry of the catalysis of the enzyme is clarified on the basis of the structures of tAsS (argininosuccinate synthetase from T. thermophilus HB8) complexes.</p>

<p>Snapshots of three consecutive steps in the proteolytic reaction of HIV-1 protease (PR) were obtained in crystal structures at resolutions of 1.2-1.4 Å. Structures of wild-type protease and two mutants (PR(V32I) and PR(I47V)) with V32I and I47V substitutions, which are common in drug resistance, reveal the gem-diol tetrahedral intermediate, the separating N- and C-terminal products, and the C-terminal product of an autoproteolytic peptide. These structures represent three stages in the reaction pathway and shed light on the reaction mechanism. The near-atomic-resolution geometric details include a short hydrogen bond between the intermediate and the outer carboxylate oxygen of one catalytic Asp25 that is conserved in all three structures. The two products in the complex with mutant PR(I47V) have a 2.2 Å separation of the amide and carboxyl carbon of the adjacent ends, suggesting partial cleavage prior to product release. The complex of mutant PR(V32I) with a single C-terminal product shows density for water molecules in the other half of the binding site, including a partial occupancy water molecule interacting with the product carboxylate end and the carbonyl oxygen of one conformation of Gly27, which suggests a potential role of Gly27 in recycling from the product complex to the ligand-free enzyme. These structural details at near-atomic resolution enhance our understanding of the reaction pathway and will assist in the design of mechanism-based inhibitors as antiviral agents.</p>

<p>Two thioesterases are commonly found in natural product biosynthetic clusters, a type I thioesterase that is responsible for removing the final product from the biosynthetic complex and a type II thioesterase that is believed to perform housekeeping functions such as removing aberrant units from carrier domains. We present the crystal structure and the kinetic analysis of RifR, a type II thioesterase from the hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetases/polyketide synthase rifamycin biosynthetic cluster of Amycolatopsis mediterranei. Steady-state kinetics show that RifR has a preference for the hydrolysis of acyl units from the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the acyl carrier domain over the hydrolysis of acyl units from the phosphopantetheinyl arm of acyl-CoAs as well as a modest preference for the decarboxylated substrate mimics acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA over malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. Multiple RifR conformations and structural similarities to other thioesterases suggest that movement of a helical lid controls access of substrates to the active site of RifR.</p>

<p>Hydroxamates (R-CONHOH) have been scarcely investigated as carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) inhibitors (CAIs). An inhibition/structural study of PhCONHOH is reported against all human isoforms. Comparing aliphatic (R = Me and CF(3)) and aromatic (R = Ph) hydroxamates as CAIs, we prove that CONHOH is a versatile zinc binding group. Depending on the nature of the R moiety, it can adopt different coordination modes to the catalytic ion within the CA active site.</p>

These structural details at near-atomic resolution enhance our understanding of the reaction pathway and will assist in the design of mechanism-based inhibitors as antiviral agents.</p>

<p>Small highly soluble probe molecules such as aniline, urea, N-methylurea, 2-bromoacetate, 1,2-propanediol, nitrous oxide, benzamidine, and phenol were soaked into crystals of various proteins to map their binding pockets and to detect hot spots of binding with respect to hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. The selected probe molecules were first tested at the zinc protease thermolysin. They were then applied to a wider range of proteins such as protein kinase A, D-xylose isomerase, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase, endothiapepsin, and secreted aspartic protease 2. The crystal structures obtained clearly show that the probe molecules populate the protein binding pockets in an ordered fashion. The thus characterized, experimentally observed hot spots of binding were subjected to computational active site mapping using HotspotsX. This approach uses knowledge-based pair potentials to detect favorable binding positions for various atom types. Good agreement between the in silico hot spot predictions and the experimentally observed positions of the polar hydrogen bond forming functional groups and hydrophobic portions was obtained. Finally, we compared the observed poses of the small-molecule probes with those of much larger structurally related ligands. They coincide remarkably well with the larger ligands, considering their spatial orientation and the experienced interaction patterns. This observation confirms the fundamental hypothesis of fragment-based lead discovery: that binding poses, even of very small molecular probes, do not significantly deviate or move once a ligand is grown further into the binding site. This underscores the fact that these probes populate given hot spots and can be regarded as relevant seeds for further design.</p>

<p>Trans-sialidases (TS) are GPI-anchored surface enzymes expressed in specific developmental stages of trypanosome parasites like Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, and T. brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness. TS catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid residues from host to parasite glycoconjugates through a transglycosidase reaction that appears to be critical for T. cruzi survival and cell invasion capability. We report here the structure of the T. cruzi trans-sialidase, alone and in complex with sugar ligands. Sialic acid binding is shown to trigger a conformational switch that modulates the affinity for the acceptor substrate and concomitantly creates the conditions for efficient transglycosylation. The structure provides a framework for the structure-based design of novel inhibitors with potential therapeutic applications.</p>

<p>Leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase (LTA4H) is a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the committed step in the formation of the proinflammatory mediator LTB4. Recently, the chemotactic tripeptide Pro-Gly-Pro was identified as an endogenous aminopeptidase substrate for LTA4 hydrolase. Here, we determined the crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase in complex with a Pro-Gly-Pro analog at 1.72 Å. From the structure, which includes the catalytic water, and mass spectrometric analysis of enzymatic hydrolysis products of Pro-Gly-Pro, it could be inferred that LTA4 hydrolase cleaves at the N terminus of the palindromic tripeptide. Furthermore, we designed a small molecule, 4-(4-benzylphenyl)thiazol-2-amine, denoted ARM1, that inhibits LTB4 synthesis in human neutrophils (IC50 of ∼0.5 μM) and conversion of LTA4 into LTB4 by purified LTA4H with a Ki of 2.3 μM. In contrast, 50- to 100-fold higher concentrations of ARM1 did not significantly affect hydrolysis of Pro-Gly-Pro. A 1.62-Å crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase in a dual complex with ARM1 and the Pro-Gly-Pro analog revealed that ARM1 binds in the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the ω-end of LTA4, distant from the aminopeptidase active site, thus providing a molecular basis for its inhibitory profile. Hence, ARM1 selectively blocks conversion of LTA4 into LTB4, although sparing the enzyme's anti-inflammatory aminopeptidase activity (i.e., degradation and inactivation of Pro-Gly-Pro). ARM1 represents a new class of LTA4 hydrolase inhibitor that holds promise for improved anti-inflammatory properties. </p>

<p>To identify specific bacterial thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors, we exploited phenolphthalein (PTH), which inhibits both bacterial and human enzymes. The X-ray crystal structure of Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS) that binds PTH showed multiple binding modes of the inhibitor, which prevented a classical structure-based drug design approach. To overcome this issue, we synthesized two phthalimidic libraries that were tested against TS enzymes and then we performed X-ray crystallographic screening of the active compounds. Compounds 6A, 8A, and 12A showed 40-fold higher affinity for bacterial TS than human TS. The X-ray crystallographic screening characterized the binding mode of six inhibitors in complexes with LcTS. Of these, 20A, 23A, and 24A showed a common unique binding mode, whereas 8A showed a different, unique binding mode. A comparative analysis of the LcTS X-ray complexes that were obtained with the pathogenic TS enabled the selection of compounds 8A and 23A as specific compounds and starting points to be exploited for the specific inhibition of pathogen enzymes.</p>

<p>Ehrlich's pioneering chemotherapeutic experiments published in 1904 (Ehrlich, P., and Shiga, K. (1904) Berlin Klin. Wochenschrift 20, 329-362) described the efficacy of a series of dye molecules including trypan blue and trypan red to eliminate trypanosome infections in mice. The molecular structures of the dyes provided a starting point for the synthesis of suramin, which was developed and used as a trypanocidal drug in 1916 and is still in clinical use. Despite the biological importance of these dye-like molecules, the mode of action on trypanosomes has remained elusive. Here we present crystal structures of suramin and three related dyes in complex with pyruvate kinases from Leishmania mexicana or from Trypanosoma cruzi. The phenyl sulfonate groups of all four molecules (suramin, Ponceau S, acid blue 80, and benzothiazole-2,5-disulfonic acid) bind in the position of ADP/ATP at the active sites of the pyruvate kinases (PYKs). The binding positions in the two different trypanosomatid PYKs are nearly identical. We show that suramin competitively inhibits PYKs from humans (muscle, tumor, and liver isoenzymes, K(i) = 1.1-17 μM), T. cruzi (K(i) = 108 μM), and L. mexicana (K(i) = 116 μM), all of which have similar active sites. Synergistic effects were observed when examining suramin inhibition in the presence of an allosteric effector molecule, whereby IC(50) values decreased up to 2-fold for both trypanosomatid and human PYKs. These kinetic and structural analyses provide insight into the promiscuous inhibition observed for suramin and into the mode of action of the dye-like molecules used in Ehrlich's original experiments.</p>

<p>The fourth reaction step of CO(2)-reduction to methane in methanogenic archaea is catalyzed by coenzyme F(420)-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Mtd). We have structurally characterized this enzyme in the selenomethionine-labelled form from the hyperthermophilic methanogenic archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri at 1.54A resolution using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method for phase determination. Mtd was found to be a homohexameric protein complex that is organized as a trimer of dimers. The fold of the individual subunits is composed of two domains: a larger alpha,beta domain and a smaller helix bundle domain with a short C-terminal beta-sheet segment. In the homohexamer the alpha,beta domains are positioned at the outside of the enzyme, whereas, the helix bundle domains assemble towards the inside to form an unusual quarternary structure with a 12-helix bundle around a 3-fold axis. No structural similarities are detectable to other enzymes with F(420) and/or substituted tetrahydropterins as substrates. The substrate binding sites of F(420) and methylenetetrahydromethanopterin are most likely embedded into a crevice between the domains of one subunit, their isoalloxazine and tetrahydropterin rings being placed inside a pocket formed by this crevice and a loop segment of the adjacent monomer of the dimer. Mtd revealed the highest stability at low salt concentrations of all structurally characterized enzymes from M.kandleri. This finding might be due to the compact quaternary structure that buries 36% of the monomer surface and to the large number of ion pairs.</p>

<p>Glycogenin initiates the synthesis of a maltosaccharide chain covalently attached to itself on Tyr195 via a stepwise glucosylation reaction, priming glycogen synthesis. We have captured crystallographic snapshots of human glycogenin during its reaction cycle, revealing a dynamic conformational switch between ground and active states mediated by the sugar donor UDP-glucose. This switch includes the ordering of a polypeptide stretch containing Tyr195, and major movement of an approximately 30-residue "lid" segment covering the active site. The rearranged lid guides the nascent maltosaccharide chain into the active site in either an intra- or intersubunit mode dependent upon chain length and steric factors and positions the donor and acceptor sugar groups for catalysis. The Thr83Met mutation, which causes glycogen storage disease XV, is conformationally locked in the ground state and catalytically inactive. Our data highlight the conformational plasticity of glycogenin and coexistence of two modes of glucosylation as integral to its catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Plasmodium and other apicomplexan parasites are deficient in purine biosynthesis, relying instead on the salvage of purines from their host environment. Therefore, interference with the purine salvage pathway is an attractive therapeutic target. The plasmodial enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) plays a central role in purine salvage and, unlike mammalian ADA homologs, has a further secondary role in methylthiopurine recycling. For this reason, plasmodial ADA accepts a wider range of substrates, as it is responsible for deamination of both adenosine and 5'-methylthioadenosine. The latter substrate is not accepted by mammalian ADA homologs. The structural basis for this natural difference in specificity between plasmodial and mammalian ADA has not been well understood. We now report crystal structures of Plasmodium vivax ADA in complex with adenosine, guanosine, and the picomolar inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin. These structures highlight a drastic conformational change in plasmodial ADA upon substrate binding that has not been observed for mammalian ADA enzymes. Further, these complexes illuminate the structural basis for the differential substrate specificity and potential drug selectivity between mammalian and parasite enzymes.</p>

<p>DNA is being constantly damaged by endo- and exogenous agents such as reactive oxygen species, chemicals, radioactivity, and ultraviolet radiation. Additionally, DNA is inherently labile, and this can result in, for example, the spontaneous hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond that connects the sugar and the nucleobase moieties in DNA; this results in abasic sites. It has long been obscure how cells achieve DNA synthesis past these lesions, and only recently has it been discovered that several specialized DNA polymerases are involved in translesion synthesis. The underlying mechanisms that render one DNA polymerase competent in translesion synthesis while another DNA polymerase fails are still indistinct. Recently two variants of Taq DNA polymerase that exhibited higher lesion bypass ability than the wild-type enzyme were identified by directed-evolution approaches. Strikingly, in both approaches it was independently found that substitution of a single nonpolar amino acid side chain by a cationic side chain increases the capability of translesion synthesis. Here, we combined both mutations in a single enzyme. We found that the KlenTaq DNA polymerase that bore both mutations superseded the wild-type as well as the respective single mutants in translesion-bypass proficiency. Further insights in the molecular basis of the detected gain of translesion-synthesis function were obtained by structural studies of DNA polymerase variants caught in processing canonical and damaged substrates. We found that increased positive charge of the surface potential in the area proximal to the negatively charged substrates promotes translesion synthesis by KlenTaq DNA polymerase, an enzyme that has very limited naturally evolved capability to perform translesion synthesis. Since expanded positively charged surface potential areas are also found in naturally evolved translesion DNA polymerases, our results underscore the impact of charge on the proficiency of naturally evolved translesion DNA polymerases.</p>

<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encodes an aspartic protease (PR) that cleaves viral polyproteins into mature proteins, thus leading to the formation of infectious particles. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are successful virostatics. However, their efficiency is compromised by antiviral resistance. In the PR sequence of viral variants resistant to the PI nelfinavir, the mutations D30N and L90M appear frequently. However, these two mutations are seldom found together in vivo, suggesting that there are two alternative evolutionary pathways leading to nelfinavir resistance. Here we analyze the proteolytic activities, X-ray structures, and thermodynamics of inhibitor binding to HIV-1 PRs harboring the D30N and L90M mutations alone and in combination with other compensatory mutations. Vitality values obtained for recombinant mutant proteases and selected PR inhibitors confirm the crucial role of mutations in positions 30 and 90 for nelfinavir resistance. The combination of the D30N and L90M mutations significantly increases the enzyme vitality in the presence of nelfinavir, without a dramatic decrease in the catalytic efficiency of the recombinant enzyme. Crystal structures, molecular dynamics simulations, and calorimetric data for four mutants (D30N, D30N/A71V, D30N/N88D, and D30N/L90M) were used to augment our kinetic data. Calorimetric analysis revealed that the entropic contribution to the mutant PR/nelfinavir interaction is less favorable than the entropic contribution to the binding of nelfinavir by wild-type PR. This finding is supported by the structural data and simulations; nelfinavir binds most strongly to the wild-type protease, which has the lowest number of protein-ligand hydrogen bonds and whose structure exhibits the greatest degree of fluctuation upon inhibitor binding.</p>

<p>dUTPases are essential to eliminate dUTP for DNA integrity and provide dUMP for thymidylate biosynthesis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis apparently lacks any other thymidylate biosynthesis pathway, therefore dUTPase is a promising antituberculotic drug target. Crystal structure of the mycobacterial enzyme in complex with the isosteric substrate analog, alpha,beta-imido-dUTP and Mg(2+) at 1.5A resolution was determined that visualizes the full-length C-terminus, previously not localized. Interactions of a conserved motif important in catalysis, the Mycobacterium-specific five-residue-loop insert and C-terminal tetrapeptide could now be described in detail. Stacking of C-terminal histidine upon the uracil moiety prompted replacement with tryptophan. The resulting sensitive fluorescent sensor enables fast screening for binding of potential inhibitors to the active site. K(d) for alpha,beta-imido-dUTP binding to mycobacterial dUTPase is determined to be 10-fold less than for human dUTPase, which is to be considered in drug optimization. A robust continuous activity assay for kinetic screening is proposed.</p>

<p>The aspartate biosynthetic pathway provides essential metabolites for many important biological functions, including the production of four essential amino acids. As this critical pathway is only present in plants and microbes, any disruptions will be fatal to these organisms. An early pathway enzyme, l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, produces a key intermediate at the first branch point of this pathway. Developing potent and selective inhibitors against several orthologs in the l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase family can serve as lead compounds for antibiotic development. Kinetic studies of two small molecule fragment libraries have identified inhibitors that show good selectivity against l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenases from two different bacterial species, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Vibrio cholerae, despite the presence of an identical constellation of active site amino acids in this homologous enzyme family. Structural characterization of enzyme-inhibitor complexes have elucidated different modes of binding between these structurally related enzymes. This information provides the basis for a structure-guided approach to the development of more potent and more selective inhibitors.</p>

<p>The protein kinase family represents an enormous opportunity for drug development. However, the current limitation in structural diversity of kinase inhibitors has complicated efforts to identify effective treatments of diseases that involve protein kinase signaling pathways. We have identified a new structural class of protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitors comprising an aminoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine nucleus. In this report, we describe the first successful use of this class of aza-heterocycles to generate potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases that compete with ATP for binding to a catalytic subunit of the protein. Co-crystal structures of CDK2 in complex with lead compounds reveal a unique mode of binding. Using this knowledge, a structure-based design approach directed this chemical scaffold toward generating potent and selective CDK2 inhibitors, which selectively inhibited the CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rb and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in HCT 116 tumor cells. The discovery of this new class of ATP-site-directed protein kinase inhibitors, aminoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, provides the basis for a new medicinal chemistry tool to be used in the search for effective treatments of cancer and other diseases that involve protein kinase signaling pathways.</p>

<p>The majority of HIV-1 infections around the world result from non-B clade HIV-1 strains. The CRF01_AE (AE) strain is seen principally in Southeast Asia. AE protease differs by approximately 10% in amino acid sequence from clade B protease and carries several naturally occurring polymorphisms that are associated with drug resistance in clade B. AE protease has been observed to develop resistance through a nonactive-site N88S mutation in response to nelfinavir (NFV) therapy, whereas clade B protease develops both the active-site mutation D30N and the nonactive-site mutation N88D. Structural and biochemical studies were carried out with wild-type and NFV-resistant clade B and AE protease variants. The relationship between clade-specific sequence variations and pathways to inhibitor resistance was also assessed. AE protease has a lower catalytic turnover rate than clade B protease, and it also has weaker affinity for both NFV and darunavir (DRV). This weaker affinity may lead to the nonactive-site N88S variant in AE, which exhibits significantly decreased affinity for both NFV and DRV. The D30N/N88D mutations in clade B resulted in a significant loss of affinity for NFV and, to a lesser extent, for DRV. A comparison of crystal structures of AE protease shows significant structural rearrangement in the flap hinge region compared with those of clade B protease and suggests insights into the alternative pathways to NFV resistance. In combination, our studies show that sequence polymorphisms within clades can alter protease activity and inhibitor binding and are capable of altering the pathway to inhibitor resistance.</p>

<p>An X-ray structure (resolution 2.2 A) of mutant HIV-1 protease (A71V, V82T, I84V) complexed with a newly developed peptidomimetic inhibitor with an ethylenamine isostere Boc-Phe-Psi[CH(2)CH(2)NH]-Phe-Glu-Phe-NH(2), denoted as OE, is described and compared with the complex of wild-type HIV-1 protease with the same inhibitor (resolution 2.5 A). OE shows tight binding to the wild type (K(i) = 1.5 nM) as well as mutant (K(i) = 4.1 nM) protease. The hydrogen bonds formed, in the case of hydroxyethylamine inhibitors, by a hydroxyl group are, in the case of OE inhibitors, replaced by a bifurcated hydrogen bond from the isosteric NH group to both catalytic aspartates Asp 25 and Asp 125. The binding modes of OE inhibitor to the wild type and mutant protease are similar. However, in the mutant protease, weaker van der Waals interactions of the mutated residues Val 84 and Val 184 with OE were found. This lack of interaction energy is compensated by a new aromatic hydrogen bond between the phenyl ring of the inhibitor in position P1 and the mutated residue Thr 182. Energy analysis based on molecular mechanics has been performed to distinguish between the static and dynamic backgrounds of disorder observed at the mutation sites Thr 82, Val 84, Thr 182, and Val 184.</p>

<p>Improvements on the computational methods for affinity prediction from the structure of protein-ligand complexes require a better understanding of the nature of molecular interactions and biomolecular recognition principles. In the present contribution, the binding of two chemically closely related human aldose reductase inhibitors had been studied by high-resolution X-ray analysis (0.92-1.35 Ǻ) and isothermal titration calorimetry against a series of single-site mutants of the wild-type protein. A crucial threonine thought to be involved in a short bromine-to-oxygen halogen bond to the inhibitors in the wild type has been mutated to the structurally similar residues alanine, cysteine, serine and valine. Overall, structurally, the binding mode of the inhibitors is conserved; however, small but significant geometrical adaptations are observed as a consequence of the spatial and electronic changes at the mutation site. They involve the opening of a central bond angle and shifts in consequence of the lost or gained halogen bonds. Remarkably, the tiny structural changes are responded by partly strong modulation of the thermodynamic profiles. Even though the free energy of binding is maximally perturbed by only 7 kJ/mol, much stronger modulations and shifts in the enthalpy and entropy signatures are revealed, which indicate a pronounced enthalpy/entropy compensation. However, an explanatory correlation can be detected when facing these perturbances against the small structural changes. This also provides deeper insights into how single-site mutations can alter the selectivity profile of closely related ligands against a target protein.</p>

<p>The class I terpenoid cyclase epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS) utilizes the universal achiral isoprenoid substrate, farnesyl diphosphate, to generate epi-isozizaene as the predominant sesquiterpene cyclization product and at least five minor sesquiterpene products, making EIZS an ideal platform for the exploration of fidelity and promiscuity in a terpenoid cyclization reaction. The hydrophobic active site contour of EIZS serves as a template that enforces a single substrate conformation, and chaperones subsequently formed carbocation intermediates through a well-defined mechanistic sequence. Here, we have used the crystal structure of EIZS as a guide to systematically remold the hydrophobic active site contour in a library of 26 site-specific mutants. Remolded cyclization templates reprogram the reaction cascade not only by reproportioning products generated by the wild-type enzyme but also by generating completely new products of diverse structure. Specifically, we have tripled the overall number of characterized products generated by EIZS. Moreover, we have converted EIZS into six different sesquiterpene synthases: F96A EIZS is an (E)-β-farnesene synthase, F96W EIZS is a zizaene synthase, F95H EIZS is a β-curcumene synthase, F95M EIZS is a β-acoradiene synthase, F198L EIZS is a β-cedrene synthase, and F96V EIZS and W203F EIZS are (Z)-γ-bisabolene synthases. Active site aromatic residues appear to be hot spots for reprogramming the cyclization cascade by manipulating the stability and conformation of critical carbocation intermediates. A majority of mutant enzymes exhibit only relatively modest 2-100-fold losses of catalytic activity, suggesting that residues responsible for triggering substrate ionization readily tolerate mutations deeper in the active site cavity. </p>

<p>Subunit F of V-ATPases is proposed to undergo structural alterations during catalysis and reversible dissociation from the V1VO complex. Recently, we determined the low resolution structure of F from Saccharomyces cerevisiae V-ATPase, showing an N-terminal egg shape, connected to a C-terminal hook-like segment via a linker region. To understand the mechanistic role of subunit F of S. cerevisiae V-ATPase, composed of 118 amino acids, the crystal structure of the major part of F, F(1-94), was solved at 2.3 Å resolution. The structural features were confirmed by solution NMR spectroscopy using the entire F subunit. The eukaryotic F subunit consists of the N-terminal F(1-94) domain with four-parallel β-strands, which are intermittently surrounded by four α-helices, and the C terminus, including the α5-helix encompassing residues 103 to 113. Two loops (26)GQITPETQEK(35) and (60)ERDDI(64) are described to be essential in mechanistic processes of the V-ATPase enzyme. The (26)GQITPETQEK(35) loop becomes exposed when fitted into the recently determined EM structure of the yeast V1VO-ATPase. A mechanism is proposed in which the (26)GQITPETQEK(35) loop of subunit F and the flexible C-terminal domain of subunit H move in proximity, leading to an inhibitory effect of ATPase activity in V1. Subunits D and F are demonstrated to interact with subunit d. Together with NMR dynamics, the role of subunit F has been discussed in the light of its interactions in the processes of reversible disassembly and ATP hydrolysis of V-ATPases by transmitting movements of subunit d and H of the VO and V1 sector, respectively.</p>

<p>Arginase from parasitic protozoa belonging to the genus Leishmania is a potential drug target for the treatment of leishmaniasis because this binuclear manganese metalloenzyme catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of polyamines that enable cell growth and survival. The high resolution X-ray crystal structures of the unliganded form of Leishmania mexicana arginase (LmARG) and four inhibitor complexes are now reported. These complexes include the reactive substrate analogue 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid (ABH) and the hydroxylated substrate analogue nor-N(ω)-hydroxy-l-arginine (nor-NOHA), which are the most potent arginase inhibitors known to date. Comparisons of the LmARG structure with that of the archetypal arginase, human arginase I, reveal that all residues important for substrate binding and catalysis are strictly conserved. However, three regions of tertiary structure differ between the parasitic enzyme and the human enzyme corresponding to the G62 - S71, L161 - C172, and I219 - V230 segments of LmARG. Additionally, variations are observed in salt link interactions that stabilize trimer assembly in LmARG. We also report biological studies in which we demonstrate that localization of LmARG to the glycosome, a unique subcellular organelle peculiar to Leishmania and related parasites, is essential for robust pathogenesis.</p>

<p>RtcB is an atypical RNA ligase that joins either 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or 3'-phosphate termini to 5'-hydroxyl termini. In contrast to typical RNA ligases, which rely on ATP and Mg(II), catalysis by RtcB is dependent on GTP and Mn(II) with ligation proceeding through a covalent RtcB-histidine-GMP intermediate. Here, we present three structures of Pyrococcus horikoshii RtcB complexes that capture snapshots along the entire guanylylation pathway. These structures show that prior to binding GTP, a single manganese ion (Mn1) is bound to RtcB. To capture the step immediately preceding RtcB guanylylation, we determined a structure of RtcB in complex with Mn(II) and the unreactive GTP analogue guanosine 5'-(α-thio)triphosphate (GTPαS). This structure shows that Mn1 is poised to stabilize the pentavalent transition state of guanylylation while a second manganese ion (Mn2) is coordinated to a nonbridging oxygen of the γ-phosphoryl group. The pyrophosphate leaving group of GTPαS is oriented apically to His404 with the ε-nitrogen poised for in-line attack on the α-phosphorus atom. The structure of RtcB in complex with GTPαS also reveals the network of hydrogen bonds that recognize GTP and illuminates the significant conformational changes that accompany the binding of this cofactor. Finally, a structure of the enzymic histidine-GMP intermediate depicts the end of the guanylylation pathway. The ensuing molecular description of the RtcB guanylylation pathway shows that RtcB and classical ATP- and Mg(II)-dependent nucleic acid ligases have converged upon a similar two-metal mechanism for formation of the nucleotidylated enzyme intermediate.</p>

<p>The immunosuppressive drug FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), an immunophilin family with the immunosuppressive drug FK506 binding property, exhibit peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. While the cyclophilin-catalyzed peptidylprolyl isomerization of X-Pro peptide bonds has been extensively studied, the mechanism of the FKBP-mediated peptidylprolyl isomerization remains uncharacterized. Thus, to investigate the binding of FKBP with its substrate and the underlying catalytic mechanism of the FKBP-mediated proline isomerization, here we employed the FK506 binding domain (FKBD) of the human malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax FK506 binding protein 35 (PvFKBP35) and examined the details of the molecular interaction between the isomerase and a peptide substrate. The crystallographic structures of apo PvFKBD35 and its complex with the tetrapeptide substrate succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (sALPFp) determined at 1.4 Å and 1.65 Å resolutions, respectively, showed that the substrate binds to PvFKBD35 in a cis conformation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies demonstrated the chemical shift perturbations of D55, H67, V73, and I74 residues upon the substrate binding. In addition, the X-ray crystal structure, along with the mutational studies, shows that Y100 is a key residue for the catalytic activity. Taken together, our results provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of PvFKBP35-mediated cis-trans isomerization of substrate and ultimately might aid designing substrate mimetic inhibitors targeting the malarial parasite FKBPs.</p>

<p>Penicillin-binding protein 6 (PBP6) is one of the two main DD-carboxypeptidases in Escherichia coli, which are implicated in maturation of bacterial cell wall and formation of cell shape. Here, we report the first X-ray crystal structures of PBP6, capturing its apo state (2.1 A), an acyl-enzyme intermediate with the antibiotic ampicillin (1.8 A), and for the first time for a PBP, a preacylation complex (a "Michaelis complex", determined at 1.8 A) with a peptidoglycan substrate fragment containing the full pentapeptide, NAM-(L-Ala-D-isoGlu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala). These structures illuminate the molecular interactions essential for ligand recognition and catalysis by DD-carboxypeptidases, and suggest a coupling of conformational flexibility of active site loops to the reaction coordinate. The substrate fragment complex structure, in particular, provides templates for models of cell wall recognition by PBPs, as well as substantiating evidence for the molecular mimicry by beta-lactam antibiotics of the peptidoglycan acyl-D-Ala-D-Ala moiety.</p>

<p>Eukaryotic glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) contains an appended N-terminal domain (NTD) whose precise function is unknown. Although GlnRS structures from two prokaryotic species are known, no eukaryotic GlnRS structure has been reported. Here we present the first crystallographic structure of yeast GlnRS, finding that the structure of the C-terminal domain is highly similar to Escherichia coli GlnRS but that 214 residues, including the NTD, are crystallographically disordered. We present a model of the full-length enzyme in solution, using the structures of the C-terminal domain, and the isolated NTD, with small-angle X-ray scattering data of the full-length molecule. We proceed to model the enzyme bound to tRNA, using the crystallographic structures of GatCAB and GlnRS-tRNA complex from bacteria. We contrast the tRNA-bound model with the tRNA-free solution state and perform molecular dynamics on the full-length GlnRS-tRNA complex, which suggests that tRNA binding involves the motion of a conserved hinge in the NTD. </p>

<p>Selenomethionine labeling is the most common technique used in protein crystallography to derivatize recombinant proteins for experimental phasing using anomalous scattering at tunable synchrotron beamlines. Recently, it has been shown that UV radiation depletes electron density of selenium atoms of selenomethionine residues and that UV radiation-damage-induced phasing (equivalent to single isomorphous replacement) protocol can be applied to calculate experimental phases. Here we present the straightforward integration of a UV source with an in-house diffractometer. We show how this setup can extend the capabilities of a sealed tube X-ray generator and be used for experimental phasing of selenium-labeled proteins.</p>

<p>dUTP pyrophosphatases (dUTPases) are essential for genome integrity. Recent results allowed characterization of the role of conserved residues. Here we analyzed the Asp/Asn mutation within conserved Motif I of human and mycobacterial dUTPases, wherein the Asp residue was previously implicated in Mg(2+)-coordination. Our results on transient/steady-state kinetics, ligand binding and a 1.80 A resolution structure of the mutant mycobacterial enzyme, in comparison with wild type and C-terminally truncated structures, argue that this residue has a major role in providing intra- and intersubunit contacts, but is not essential for Mg(2+) accommodation. We conclude that in addition to the role of conserved motifs in substrate accommodation, direct subunit interaction between protein atoms of active site residues from different conserved motifs are crucial for enzyme function.</p>

<p>The inhibition of a subgroup of human serine/threonine protein phosphatases is responsible for the cytotoxicity of cantharidin and norcantharidin against tumor cells. It is shown that the anhydride rings of cantharidin and norcantharidin are hydrolyzed when bound to the catalytic domain of the human serine/threonine protein phosphatases 5 (PP5c), and the high-resolution crystal structures of PP5c complexed with the corresponding dicarboxylic acid derivatives of the two molecules are reported. Norcantharidin shows a unique binding conformation with the catalytically active Mn2PP5c, while cantharidin is characterized by a double conformation in its binding mode to the protein. Different binding modes of norcantharidin are observed depending of whether the starting ligand is in the anhydride or in the dicarboxylic acid form. All these structures will provide the basis for the rational design of new cantharidin-based drugs.</p>

<p>Proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) catalyzes the FAD-dependent oxidation of proline to Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which is the first step of proline catabolism. Here, we report the structures of proline dehydrogenase from Deinococcus radiodurans in the oxidized state complexed with the proline analogue L-tetrahydrofuroic acid and in the reduced state with the proline site vacant. The analogue binds against the si face of the FAD isoalloxazine and is protected from bulk solvent by helix α8 and the β1-α1 loop. The FAD ribityl chain adopts two conformations in the E-S complex, which is unprecedented for flavoenzymes. One of the conformations is novel for the PRODH superfamily and may contribute to the low substrate affinity of Deinococcus PRODH. Reduction of the crystalline enzyme-inhibitor complex causes profound structural changes, including 20° butterfly bending of the isoalloxazine, crankshaft rotation of the ribityl, shifting of α8 by 1.7 Å, reconfiguration of the β1-α1 loop, and rupture of the Arg291-Glu64 ion pair. These changes dramatically open the active site to facilitate product release and allow electron acceptors access to the reduced flavin. The structures suggest that the ion pair, which is conserved in the PRODH superfamily, functions as the active site gate. Mutagenesis of Glu64 to Ala decreases the catalytic efficiency 27-fold, which demonstrates the importance of the gate. Mutation of Gly63 decreases the efficiency 140-fold, which suggests that flexibility of the β1-α1 loop is essential for optimal catalysis. The large conformational changes that are required to form the E-S complex suggest that conformational selection plays a role in substrate recognition.</p>

<p>In plants, oxylipins regulate developmental processes and defense responses. The first specific step in the biosynthesis of the cyclopentanone class of oxylipins is catalyzed by allene oxide cyclase (AOC) that forms cis(+)-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid. The moss Physcomitrella patens has two AOCs (PpAOC1 and PpAOC2) with different substrate specificities for C₁₈- and C₂₀-derived substrates, respectively. To better understand AOC's catalytic mechanism and to elucidate the structural properties that explain the differences in substrate specificity, we solved and analyzed the crystal structures of 36 monomers of both apo and ligand complexes of PpAOC1 and PpAOC2. From these data, we propose the following intermediates in AOC catalysis: (1) a resting state of the apo enzyme with a closed conformation, (2) a first shallow binding mode, followed by (3) a tight binding of the substrate accompanied by conformational changes in the binding pocket, and (4) initiation of the catalytic cycle by opening of the epoxide ring. As expected, the substrate dihydro analog cis-12,13S-epoxy-9Z,15Z-octadecadienoic acid did not cyclize in the presence of PpAOC1; however, when bound to the enzyme, it underwent isomerization into the corresponding trans-epoxide. By comparing complex structures of the C₁₈ substrate analog with in silico modeling of the C₂₀ substrate analog bound to the enzyme allowed us to identify three major molecular determinants responsible for the different substrate specificities (i.e. larger active site diameter, an elongated cavity of PpAOC2, and two nonidentical residues at the entrance of the active site).</p>

<p>The proline-utilization pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has recently been identified as an important factor in Mtb persistence in vivo, suggesting that this pathway could be a valuable therapeutic target against tuberculosis (TB). In Mtb, two distinct enzymes perform the conversion of proline into glutamate: the first step is the oxidation of proline into Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) by the flavoenzyme proline dehydrogenase (PruB), and the second reaction involves converting the tautomeric form of P5C (glutamate-γ-semialdehyde) into glutamate using the NAD(+)-dependent Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic dehydrogenase (PruA). Here, the three-dimensional structures of Mtb-PruA, determined by X-ray crystallography, in the apo state and in complex with NAD(+) are described at 2.5 and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively. The structure reveals a conserved NAD(+)-binding mode, common to other related enzymes. Species-specific conformational differences in the active site, however, linked to changes in the dimer interface, suggest possibilities for selective inhibition of Mtb-PruA despite its reasonably high sequence identity to other PruA enzymes. Using recombinant PruA and PruB, the proline-utilization pathway in Mtb has also been reconstituted in vitro. Functional validation using a novel NMR approach has demonstrated that the PruA and PruB enzymes are together sufficient to convert proline to glutamate, the first such demonstration for monofunctional proline-utilization enzymes. </p>

<p>Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) represents the most ancient and widespread branch in the histidine-triad protein superfamily. HINT1 plays an important role in various biological processes and has been found in many species. Here, the first complete structure of the rabbit HINT1-adenosine complex is reported at 1.10 Å resolution, which is one of the highest resolutions obtained for a HINT1 structure. The final structure has an R(cryst) of 14.25% (R(free) = 16.77%) and the model exhibits good stereochemical qualities. A detailed analysis of the atomic resolution data allowed an update of the details of the protein structure in comparison to previously published data.</p>

<p>In some bacterial species and photosynthetic cohorts, including algae, the enzyme L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (DapL) (E.C. 2.6.1.83) is involved in the anabolism of the essential amino acid L-lysine. DapL catalyzes the conversion of tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDPA) to L,L-diaminopimelate (L,L-DAP), in one step bypassing the DapD, DapC and DapE enzymatic reactions present in the acyl DAP pathways. Here we present an in vivo and in vitro characterization of the DapL ortholog from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr-DapL). The in vivo analysis illustrated that the enzyme is able to functionally complement the E. coli dap auxotrophs and was essential for plant development in Arabidopsis. In vitro, the enzyme was able to inter-convert THDPA and L,L-DAP, showing strong substrate specificity. Cr-DapL was dimeric in both solution and when crystallized. The structure of Cr-DapL was solved in its apo form, showing an overall architecture of a α/β protein with each monomer in the dimer adopting a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase-like fold in a V-shaped conformation. The active site comprises residues from both monomers in the dimer and shows some rearrangement when compared to the apo-DapL structure from Arabidopsis. Since animals do not possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for the de novo synthesis of the amino acid L-lysine, enzymes involved in this pathway are attractive targets for the development of antibiotics, herbicides and algaecides.</p>

<p>The homeostasis of intracellular diadenosine 5',5″'-P(1),P(4)-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is maintained by two 60% sequence-identical paralogs of Ap4A phosphorylases (Apa1 and Apa2). Enzymatic assays show that, compared to Apa1, Apa2 has a relatively higher phosphorylase activity towards Ap3A (5',5″'-P(1),P(3)-tetraphosphate), Ap4A, and Ap5A (5',5″'-P(1),P(5)-tetraphosphate), and Ap4A is the favorable substrate for both enzymes. To decipher the catalytic insights, we determined the crystal structures of Apa2 in the apo-, AMP-, and Ap4A-complexed forms at 2.30, 2.80, and 2.70Å resolution, respectively. Apa2 is an α/β protein with a core domain of a twisted eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by several α-helices, similar to the galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GalT) members of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily. However, a unique auxiliary domain enables an individual Apa2 monomer to possess an intact substrate-binding cleft, which is distinct from previously reported dimeric GalT proteins. This cleft is perfectly complementary to the favorable substrate Ap4A, the AMP and ATP moieties of which are perpendicular to each other, leaving the α-phosphate group exposed at the sharp turn against the catalytic residue His161. Structural comparisons combined with site-directed mutagenesis and activity assays enable us to define the key residues for catalysis. Furthermore, multiple-sequence alignment reveals that Apa2 and homologs represent canonical Ap4A phosphorylases, which could be grouped as a unique branch in the GalT family.</p>

<p>In this study, we take advantage of the ability of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) from Pseudomonas mevalonii to remain active while in its crystallized form to study the changing interactions between the ligands and protein as the first reaction intermediate is created. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes one of the few double oxidation-reduction reactions in intermediary metabolism that take place in a single active site. Our laboratory has undertaken an exploration of this reaction space using structures of HMG-CoA reductase complexed with various substrate, nucleotide, product, and inhibitor combinations. With a focus in this publication on the first hydride transfer, our structures follow this reduction reaction as the enzyme converts the HMG-CoA thioester from a flat sp(2)-like geometry to a pyramidal thiohemiacetal configuration consistent with a transition to an sp(3) orbital. This change in the geometry propagates through the coenzyme A (CoA) ligand whose first amide bond is rotated 180° where it anchors a web of hydrogen bonds that weave together the nucleotide, the reaction intermediate, the enzyme, and the catalytic residues. This creates a stable intermediate structure prepared for nucleotide exchange and the second reduction reaction within the HMG-CoA reductase active site. Identification of this reaction intermediate provides a template for the development of an inhibitor that would act as an antibiotic effective against the HMG-CoA reductase of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. </p>

<p>Phosphomannomutase (PMM) catalyses the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, an essential step in mannose activation and the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates in all eukaryotes. Deletion of PMM from Leishmania mexicana results in loss of virulence, suggesting that PMM is a promising drug target for the development of anti-leishmanial inhibitors. We report the crystallization and structure determination to 2.1 A of L. mexicana PMM alone and in complex with glucose-1,6-bisphosphate to 2.9 A. PMM is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family, but has a novel dimeric structure and a distinct cap domain of unique topology. Although the structure is novel within the HAD family, the leishmanial enzyme shows a high degree of similarity with its human isoforms. We have generated L. major PMM knockouts, which are avirulent. We expressed the human pmm2 gene in the Leishmania PMM knockout, but despite the similarity between Leishmania and human PMM, expression of the human gene did not restore virulence. Similarities in the structure of the parasite enzyme and its human isoforms suggest that the development of parasite-selective inhibitors will not be an easy task.</p>

<p>Human estrogenic 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD type 1) catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of active estrogens that stimulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Based on the initial premise to make use of the binding energies of both the substrate and cofactor sites, and molecular modeling starting from the enzyme structure, several estradiol-adenosine hybrids were designed and synthesized. Among these hybrids, EM-1745 with a linker of 8-CH2 groups is proved to be the best competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 3.0 +/- 0.8 nM. The crystal structure of the EM-1745 enzyme complex at 1.6 A provides evidence at atomic resolution of strong interactions between both the steroid and cofactor moieties and the enzyme molecule, as illustrated by a deltaA-weighted 2Fo-Fc electron density map contoured at 3.0 delta. The substrate entry loop is further stabilized in this complex compared with previous complexes of the enzyme. These results confirm our initial strategy of combining studies of structural biology and enzyme mechanism in the inhibitor design, which may be applied to other steroidogenic enzymes involved in human diseases.</p>

<p>Natural and synthetic carbamates act as pseudo-irreversible inhibitors of AChE (acetylcholinesterase) as well as BChE (butyrylcholinesterase), two enzymes involved in neuronal function as well as in the development and progression of AD (Alzheimer's disease). The AChE mode of action is characterized by a rapid carbamoylation of the active-site Ser(200) with release of a leaving group followed by a slow regeneration of enzyme action due to subsequent decarbamoylation. The experimental AD therapeutic bisnorcymserine, a synthetic carbamate, shows an interesting activity and selectivity for BChE, and its clinical development is currently being pursued. We undertook detailed kinetic studies on the activity of the carbamate bisnorcymserine with Tc (Torpedo californica) AChE and, on the basis of the results, crystallized the complex between TcAChE and bisnorcymserine. The X-ray crystal structure showed only the leaving group, bisnoreseroline, trapped at the bottom of the aromatic enzyme gorge. Specifically, bisnoreseroline interacts in a non-covalent way with Ser(200) and His(440), disrupting the existing interactions within the catalytic triad, and it stacks with Trp(84) at the bottom of the gorge, giving rise to an unprecedented hydrogen-bonding contact. These interactions point to a dominant reversible inhibition mechanism attributable to the leaving group, bisnoreseroline, as revealed by kinetic analysis.</p>

<p>The mouse cytosolic sulfotransferase, mSULT1D1, catalyzes the sulfonation of a wide range of phenolic molecules including p-nitrophenol (pNP), alpha-naphthol (alphaNT), serotonin, as well as dopamine and its metabolites. To gain insight into the structural basis for its broad range substrate specificity, we solved two distinct ternary crystal structures of mSULT1D1, complexed with 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate (PAP) plus pNP or PAP plus alphaNT. The structures revealed that the mSULT1D1 contains an L-shaped accepter-binding site which comprises 20 amino acid residues and four conserved water molecules. The shape of the accepter-binding site can be adjusted by conformational changes of two residues, Ile148 and Glu247, upon binding with respective substrates.</p>

<p>Mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3' phosphatase (PNK) plays a key role in the repair of DNA damage, functioning as part of both the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and base excision repair (BER) pathways. Through its two catalytic activities, PNK ensures that DNA termini are compatible with extension and ligation by either removing 3'-phosphates from, or by phosphorylating 5'-hydroxyl groups on, the ribose sugar of the DNA backbone. We have now determined crystal structures of murine PNK with DNA molecules bound to both of its active sites. The structure of ssDNA engaged with the 3'-phosphatase domain suggests a mechanism of substrate interaction that assists DNA end seeking. The structure of dsDNA bound to the 5'-kinase domain reveals a mechanism of DNA bending that facilitates recognition of DNA ends in the context of single-strand and double-strand breaks and suggests a close functional cooperation in substrate recognition between the kinase and phosphatase active sites.</p>

<p>Dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) are multi-domain GTPases that function via oligomerization and GTP-dependent conformational changes to play central roles in regulating membrane structure across phylogenetic kingdoms. How DRPs harness self-assembly and GTP-dependent conformational changes to remodel membranes is not understood. Here we present the crystal structure of an assembly-deficient mammalian endocytic DRP, dynamin 1, lacking the proline-rich domain, in its nucleotide-free state. The dynamin 1 monomer is an extended structure with the GTPase domain and bundle signalling element positioned on top of a long helical stalk with the pleckstrin homology domain flexibly attached on its opposing end. Dynamin 1 dimer and higher order dimer multimers form via interfaces located in the stalk. Analysis of these interfaces provides insight into DRP family member specificity and regulation and provides a framework for understanding the biogenesis of higher order DRP structures and the mechanism of DRP-mediated membrane scission events.</p>

<p>Protein kinases play a pivotal role in cell signaling, and dysregulation of many kinases has been linked to disease development. A large number of kinase inhibitors are therefore currently under investigation in clinical trials, and so far seven inhibitors have been approved as anti-cancer drugs. In addition, kinase inhibitors are widely used as specific probes to study cell signaling, but systematic studies describing selectivity of these reagents across a panel of diverse kinases are largely lacking. Here we evaluated the specificity of 156 validated kinase inhibitors, including inhibitors used in clinical trials, against 60 human Ser/Thr kinases using a thermal stability shift assay. Our analysis revealed many unexpected cross-reactivities for inhibitors thought to be specific for certain targets. We also found that certain combinations of active-site residues in the ATP-binding site correlated with the detected ligand promiscuity and that some kinases are highly sensitive to inhibition using diverse chemotypes, suggesting them as preferred intervention points. Our results uncovered also inhibitor cross-reactivities that may lead to alternate clinical applications. For example, LY333'531, a PKCbeta inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials, efficiently inhibited PIM1 kinase in our screen, a suggested target for treatment of leukemia. We determined the binding mode of this inhibitor by x-ray crystallography and in addition showed that LY333'531 induced cell death and significantly suppressed growth of leukemic cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients.</p>

<p>Argininosuccinate synthetase reversibly catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of a citrulline with an aspartate to give argininosuccinate. The structures of the enzyme from Thermus thermophilus HB8 complexed with intact ATP and substrates (citrulline and aspartate) and with AMP and product (argininosuccinate) have been determined at 2.1- and 2.0-A resolution, respectively. The enzyme does not show the ATP-induced domain rotation observed in the enzyme from Escherichia coli. In the enzyme-substrate complex, the reaction sites of ATP and the bound substrates are adjacent and are sufficiently close for the reaction to proceed without the large conformational change at the domain level. The mobility of the triphosphate group in ATP and the side chain of citrulline play an important role in the catalytic action. The protonated amino group of the bound aspartate interacts with the alpha-phosphate of ATP and the ureido group of citrulline, thus stimulating the adenylation of citrulline. The enzyme-product complex explains how the citrullyl-AMP intermediate is bound to the active site. The stereochemistry of the catalysis of the enzyme is clarified on the basis of the structures of tAsS (argininosuccinate synthetase from T. thermophilus HB8) complexes.</p>

<p>Fragment screening is becoming widely accepted as a technique to identify hit compounds for the development of novel lead compounds. In neighboring laboratories, we have recently, and independently, performed a fragment screening campaign on the HIV-1 integrase core domain (IN) using similar commercially purchased fragment libraries. The two campaigns used different screening methods for the preliminary identification of fragment hits; one used saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (STD-NMR), and the other used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. Both initial screens were followed by X-ray crystallography. Using the STD-NMR/X-ray approach, 15 IN/fragment complexes were identified, whereas the SPR/X-ray approach found 6 complexes. In this article, we compare the approaches that were taken by each group and the results obtained, and we look at what factors could potentially influence the final results. We find that despite using different approaches with little overlap of initial hits, both approaches identified binding sites on IN that provided a basis for fragment-based lead discovery and further lead development. Comparison of hits identified in the two studies highlights a key role for both the conditions under which fragment binding is measured and the criteria selected to classify hits.</p>

Both initial screens were followed by X-ray crystallography. Using the STD-NMR/X-ray approach, 15 IN/fragment complexes were identified, whereas the SPR/X-ray approach found 6 complexes. In this article, we compare the approaches that were taken by each group and the results obtained, and we look at what factors could potentially influence the final results. We find that despite using different approaches with little overlap of initial hits, both approaches identified binding sites on IN that provided a basis for fragment-based lead discovery and further lead development. Comparison of hits identified in the two studies highlights a key role for both the conditions under which fragment binding is measured and the criteria selected to classify hits.</p>

<p>Under physiological conditions, the deamidation and isomerization of asparagine to isoaspartate (isoAsp) proceeds nonenzymatically via succinimide. Although a large number of proteins have been reported to contain isoAsp, information concerning the three-dimensional structure of proteins containing isoaspartate is still limited. We have crystallized isoAsp containing Ustilago sphaerogena ribonuclease U2B, and determined the crystal structure at 1.32 Å resolution. The structure revealed that the formation of isoAsp32 induces a single turn unfolding of the α-helix from Asp29 to Asp34, and the region from Asp29 to Arg35 forms a U-shaped loop structure. The electron density map shows that isoAsp32 retained the L-configuration at the C(α) atom. IsoAsp32 is in gauche conformation about a C(α)--C(β) bond, and the polypeptide chain bends by ∼90° at isoAsp32. IsoAsp32 protrudes from the surface of the protein, and the abnormal β-peptide bond in the main-chain and α-carboxylate in the side-chain is fully exposed. The structure suggests that the deamidation of the Asn and the isoAsp formation in proteins could confer immunogenicity.</p>

<p>The double-headed arrowhead protease inhibitors API-A and -B from the tubers of Sagittaria sagittifolia (Linn) feature two distinct reactive sites, unlike other members of their family. Although the two inhibitors have been extensively characterized, the identities of the two P1 residues in both API-A and -B remain controversial. The crystal structure of a ternary complex at 2.48 A resolution revealed that the two trypsins bind on opposite sides of API-A and are 34 A apart. The overall fold of API-A belongs to the beta-trefoil fold and resembles that of the soybean Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors. The two P1 residues were unambiguously assigned as Leu(87) and Lys(145), and their identities were further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Reactive site 1, composed of residues P5 Met(83) to P5' Ala(92), adopts a novel conformation with the Leu(87) completely embedded in the S1 pocket even though it is an unfavorable P1 residue for trypsin. Reactive site 2, consisting of residues P5 Cys(141) to P5' Glu(150), binds trypsin in the classic mode by employing a two-disulfide-bonded loop. Analysis of the two binding interfaces sheds light on atomic details of the inhibitor specificity and also promises potential improvements in enzyme activity by engineering of the reactive sites.</p>

<p>p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is generally activated by dual phosphorylation but has also been shown to exhibit alternative activation modes. One of these modes included a direct interaction with phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues (PIA) inducing p38α autoactivation and apoptosis. Perifosine, an Akt inhibitor in phase II clinical trials, also showed p38α activation properties similarly to those of PIAs. The crystal structures of p38α in complex with PIA23, PIA24 and perifosine provide insights into this unique activation mode. The activating molecules bind a unique hydrophobic binding site in the kinase C'-lobe formed in part by the MAPK insert region. In addition, there are conformational changes in the short αEF/αF loop region that acts as an activation switch, inducing autophosphorylation. Structural and biochemical characterization of the αEF/αF loop identified Trp197 as a key residue in the lipid binding and in p38α catalytic activity. The lipid binding site also accommodates hydrophobic inhibitor molecules and, thus, can serve as a novel p38α-target for specific activation or inhibition, with novel therapeutic implications.</p>

<p>A series of cyclopropyl hydroxamic acids were prepared. Many of the compounds displayed picomolar affinity for the TACE enzyme while maintaining good to excellent selectivity profiles versus MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -14, and ADAM-10. X-ray analysis of an inhibitor in the TACE active site indicated that the molecules bound to the enzyme in the S1'-S3' pocket.</p>

<p>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductases (MTHFRs; EC 1.7.99.5) catalyze the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH(2)-H(4)folate) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH(3)-H(4)folate) using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor. The initial X-ray structure of Escherichia coli MTHFR revealed that this 33-kDa polypeptide is a (betaalpha)(8) barrel that aggregates to form an unusual tetramer with only 2-fold symmetry. Structures of reduced enzyme complexed with NADH and of oxidized Glu28Gln enzyme complexed with CH(3)-H(4)folate have now been determined at resolutions of 1.95 and 1.85 A, respectively. The NADH complex reveals a rare mode of dinucleotide binding; NADH adopts a hairpin conformation and is sandwiched between a conserved phenylalanine, Phe223, and the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. The nicotinamide of the bound pyridine nucleotide is stacked against the si face of the flavin ring with C4 adjoining the N5 of FAD, implying that this structure models a complex that is competent for hydride transfer. In the complex with CH(3)-H(4)folate, the pterin ring is also stacked against FAD in an orientation that is favorable for hydride transfer. Thus, the binding sites for the two substrates overlap, as expected for many enzymes that catalyze ping-pong reactions, and several invariant residues interact with both folate and pyridine nucleotide substrates. Comparisons of liganded and substrate-free structures reveal multiple conformations for the loops beta2-alpha2 (L2), beta3-alpha3 (L3), and beta4-alpha4 (L4) and suggest that motions of these loops facilitate the ping-pong reaction. In particular, the L4 loop adopts a "closed" conformation that allows Asp120 to hydrogen bond to the pterin ring in the folate complex but must move to an "open" conformation to allow NADH to bind.</p>

<p>The bifunctional diaminohydroxyphosphoribosylaminopyrimidine deaminase/5-amino-6-(5-phosphoribosylamino)uracil reductase (RibD) represents a potential antibacterial drug target. The structure of recombinant Acinetobacter baumannii RibD is reported in orthorhombic and tetragonal crystal forms at 2.2 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. Comparisons with orthologous structures in the Protein Data Bank indicated close similarities. The tetragonal crystal form was obtained in the presence of guanosine monophosphate, which surprisingly was observed to occupy the adenine-binding site of the reductase domain.</p>

<p>Nitrile hydratases (NHases) have an unusual iron or cobalt catalytic center with two oxidized cysteine ligands, cysteine-sulfinic acid and cysteine-sulfenic acid, catalyzing the hydration of nitriles to amides. Recently, we found that the NHase of Rhodococcus erythropolis N771 exhibited an additional catalytic activity, converting tert-butylisonitrile (tBuNC) to tert-butylamine. Taking advantage of the slow reactivity of tBuNC and the photoreactivity of nitrosylated NHase, we present the first structural evidence for the catalytic mechanism of NHase with time-resolved x-ray crystallography. By monitoring the reaction with attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the product from the isonitrile carbon was identified as a CO molecule. Crystals of nitrosylated inactive NHase were soaked with tBuNC. The catalytic reaction was initiated by photo-induced denitrosylation and stopped by flash cooling. tBuNC was first trapped at the hydrophobic pocket above the iron center and then coordinated to the iron ion at 120 min. At 440 min, the electron density of tBuNC was significantly altered, and a new electron density was observed near the isonitrile carbon as well as the sulfenate oxygen of alphaCys114. These results demonstrate that the substrate was coordinated to the iron and then attacked by a solvent molecule activated by alphaCys114-SOH.</p>

<p>In mammals, sulfonation as mediated by specific cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) plays an important role in the homeostasis of dopamine and other catecholamines. To gain insight into the structural basis for dopamine recognition/binding, we determined the crystal structure of a mouse dopamine-sulfating SULT, mouse SULT1D1 (mSULT1D1). Data obtained indicated that mSULT1D1 comprises of a single alpha/beta domain with a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet. In contrast to the structure of the human SULT1A3 (hSULT1A3)-dopamine complex previously reported, molecular modeling and mutational analysis revealed that a water molecule plays a critical role in the recognition of the amine group of dopamine by mSULT1D1. These results imply differences in substrate binding between dopamine-sulfating SULTs from different species.</p>

<p>Mutations in human leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been found to be the most frequent cause of late-onset Parkinson disease. Here we show that Dictyostelium discoideum Roco4 is a suitable model to study the structural and biochemical characteristics of the LRRK2 kinase and can be used for optimization of current and identification of new LRRK2 inhibitors. We have solved the structure of Roco4 kinase wild-type, Parkinson disease-related mutants G1179S and L1180T (G2019S and I2020T in LRRK2) and the structure of Roco4 kinase in complex with the LRRK2 inhibitor H1152. Taken together, our data give important insight in the LRRK2 activation mechanism and, most importantly, explain the G2019S-related increase in LRRK2 kinase activity.</p>

<p>The structures of two mutants (H192A and Y246F) of a mannuronate-specific alginate lyase, A1-III, from Sphingomonas species A1 complexed with a tetrasaccharide substrate [4-deoxy-L-erythro-hex-4-ene-pyranosyluronate-(mannuronate)(2)-mannuronic acid] were determined by X-ray crystallography at around 2.2 Å resolution together with the apo form of the H192A mutant. The final models of the complex forms, which comprised two monomers (of 353 amino-acid residues each), 268-287 water molecules and two tetrasaccharide substrates, had R factors of around 0.17. A large conformational change occurred in the position of the lid loop (residues 64-85) in holo H192A and Y246F compared with that in apo H192A. The lid loop migrated about 14 Å from an open form to a closed form to interact with the bound tetrasaccharide and a catalytic residue. The tetrasaccharide was bound in the active cleft at subsites -3 to +1 as a substrate form in which the glycosidic linkage to be cleaved existed between subsites -1 and +1. In particular, the O(η) atom of Tyr68 in the closed lid loop forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of a presumed catalytic residue, O(η) of Tyr246, which acts both as an acid and a base catalyst in a syn mechanism.</p>

<p>The enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) catalyses the first common step in the biosynthesis of the three branched-chain amino acids. Enzymes in the AHAS family generally consist of regulatory and catalytic subunits. Here, we describe the first crystal structure of an AHAS regulatory subunit, the ilvH polypeptide, determined at a resolution of 1.75 A. IlvH is the regulatory subunit of one of three AHAS isozymes expressed in Escherichia coli, AHAS III. The protein is a dimer, with two beta alpha beta beta alpha beta ferredoxin domains in each monomer. The two N-terminal domains assemble to form an ACT domain structure remarkably close to the one predicted by us on the basis of the regulatory domain of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3PGDH). The two C-terminal domains combine so that their beta-sheets are roughly positioned back-to-back and perpendicular to the extended beta-sheet of the N-terminal ACT domain. On the basis of the properties of mutants and a comparison with 3PGDH, the effector (valine) binding sites can be located tentatively in two symmetrically related positions in the interface between a pair of N-terminal domains. The properties of mutants of the ilvH polypeptide outside the putative effector-binding site provide further insight into the functioning of the holoenzyme. The results of this study open avenues for further studies aimed at understanding the mechanism of regulation of AHAS by small-molecule effectors.</p>

<p>Phosphinothricin is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). The resolution of the native structure of GS from Salmonella typhimurium has been extended to 2.5 A resolution, and the improved model is used to determine the structure of phosphinothricin complexed to GS by difference Fourier methods. The structure suggests a noncovalent, dead-end mechanism of inhibition. Phosphinothricin occupies the glutamate substrate pocket and stabilizes the Glu327 flap in a position which blocks the glutamate entrance to the active site, trapping the inhibitor on the enzyme. One oxygen of the phosphinyl group of phosphinothricin appears to be protonated, because of its proximity to the carboxylate group of Glu327. The other phosphinyl oxygen protrudes into the negatively charged binding pocket for the substrate ammonium, disrupting that pocket. The distribution of charges in the glutamate binding pocket is complementary to those of phosphinothricin. The presence of a second ammonium binding site within the active site is confirmed by its analogue thallous ion, marking the ammonium site and its protein ligands. The inhibition of GS by methionine sulfoximine can be explained by the same mechanism. These models of inhibited GS further illuminate its catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>We synthesized biarylalanine-containing hydroxamic acids and tested them on immunoprecipitated HDAC1 and HDAC6 and show a subtype selectivity for HDAC6 that was confirmed in cells by Western blot (tubulin vs histones). We obtained an X-ray structure with a HDAC6-selective inhibitor with the bacterial deacetylase HDAH. Docking studies were carried out using HDAC1 and HDAC6 protein models. Antiproliferative activity was shown on cancer cells for selected compounds.</p>

<p>Organophosphates are the largest class of known insecticides, several of which are potent nerve agents. Consequently, organophosphate-degrading enzymes are of great scientific interest as bioscavengers and biodecontaminants. Recently, a hyperthermophilic phosphotriesterase (known as SsoPox), from the Archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, has been isolated and found to possess a very high lactonase activity. Here, we report the three-dimensional structures of SsoPox in the apo form (2.6 A resolution) and in complex with a quorum-sensing lactone mimic at 2.0 A resolution. The structure also reveals an unexpected active site topology, and a unique hydrophobic channel that perfectly accommodates the lactone substrate. Structural and mutagenesis evidence allows us to propose a mechanism for lactone hydrolysis and to refine the catalytic mechanism established for phosphotriesterases. In addition, SsoPox structures permit the correlation of experimental lactonase and phosphotriesterase activities and this strongly suggests lactonase activity as the cognate function of SsoPox. This example demonstrates that promiscuous activities probably constitute a large and efficient reservoir for the creation of novel catalytic activities.</p>

<p>Isoniazid (INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazine) is one of only two therapeutic agents effective in treating tuberculosis. This prodrug is activated by the heme enzyme catalase peroxidase (KatG) endogenous to Mycobacterium tuberculosis but the mechanism of activation is poorly understood, in part because the binding interaction has not been properly established. The class I peroxidases ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) have active site structures very similar to KatG and are also capable of activating isoniazid. We report here the first crystal structures of complexes of isoniazid bound to APX and CcP. These are the first structures of isoniazid bound to any activating enzymes. The structures show that isoniazid binds close to the delta-heme edge in both APX and CcP, although the precise binding orientation varies slightly in the two cases. A second binding site for INH is found in APX at the gamma-heme edge close to the established ascorbate binding site, indicating that the gamma-heme edge can also support the binding of aromatic substrates. We also show that in an active site mutant of soybean APX (W41A) INH can bind directly to the heme iron to become an inhibitor and in a different mode when the distal histidine is replaced by alanine (H42A). These structures provide the first unambiguous evidence for the location of the isoniazid binding site in the class I peroxidases and provide rationalization of isoniazid resistance in naturally occurring KatG mutant strains of M. tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Geranyl diphosphate C-methyltransferase (GPPMT) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is the first methyltransferase discovered that modifies an acyclic isoprenoid diphosphate, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), to yield a noncanonical acyclic allylic diphosphate product, 2-methylgeranyl diphosphate, which serves as the substrate for a subsequent cyclization reaction catalyzed by a terpenoid cyclase, methylisoborneol synthase. Here, we report the crystal structures of GPPMT in complex with GPP or the substrate analogue geranyl S-thiolodiphosphate (GSPP) along with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine in the cofactor binding site, resulting from in situ demethylation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, at 2.05 or 1.82 Å resolution, respectively. These structures suggest that both GPP and GSPP can undergo catalytic methylation in crystalline GPPMT, followed by dissociation of the isoprenoid product. S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine remains bound in the active site, however, and does not exchange with a fresh molecule of cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine. These structures provide important clues about the molecular mechanism of the reaction, especially with regard to the face of the 2,3 double bond of GPP that is methylated as well as the stabilization of the resulting carbocation intermediate through cation-π interactions.</p>

<p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of cellular energy status found in all eukaryotes, responds to changes in intracellular adenosine nucleotide levels resulting from metabolic stresses. Here we describe crystal structures of a heterotrimeric regulatory core fragment from Schizosaccharomyces pombe AMPK in complex with ADP, ADP/AMP, ADP/ATP, and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-D-ribofuranotide (AICAR phosphate, or ZMP), a well-characterized AMPK activator. Prior crystallographic studies had revealed a single site in the gamma subunit that binds either ATP or AMP within Bateman domain B. Here we show that ZMP binds at this site, mimicking the binding of AMP. An analogous site in Bateman domain A selectively accommodates ADP, which binds in a distinct manner that also involves direct ligation to elements from the beta subunit. These observations suggest a possible role for ADP in regulating AMPK response to changes in cellular energy status.</p>

<p>Anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (AnPRT, EC 2.4.2.18) is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reaction between 5'-phosphoribosyl 1'-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and anthranilate, as part of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. Here we present the results of the first chemical screen for inhibitors against Mycobacterium tuberculosis AnPRT (Mtb-AnPRT), along with crystal structures of Mtb-AnPRT in complex with PRPP and several inhibitors. Previous work revealed that PRPP is bound at the base of a deep cleft in Mtb-AnPRT and predicted two anthranilate binding sites along the tunnel leading to the PRPP binding site. Unexpectedly, the inhibitors presented here almost exclusively bound at the entrance of the tunnel, in the presumed noncatalytic anthranilate binding site, previously hypothesized to have a role in substrate capture. The potencies of the inhibitors were measured, yielding Ki values of 1.5-119 μM, with the strongest inhibition displayed by a bianthranilate compound that makes hydrogen bond and salt bridge contacts with Mtb-AnPRT via its carboxyl groups. Our results reveal how the substrate capture mechanism of AnPRT can be exploited to inhibit the enzyme's activity and provide a scaffold for the design of improved Mtb-AnPRT inhibitors that may ultimately form the basis of new antituberculosis drugs with a novel mode of action. </p>

<p>Structural studies of proteins usually rely on a model obtained from one crystal. By investigating the details of this model, crystallographers seek to obtain insight into the function of the macromolecule. It is therefore important to know which details of a protein structure are reproducible or to what extent they might differ. To address this question, the high-resolution structures of five crystals of bovine trypsin obtained under analogous conditions were compared. Global parameters and structural details were investigated. All of the models were of similar quality and the pairwise merged intensities had large correlation coefficients. The C(α) and backbone atoms of the structures superposed very well. The occupancy of ligands in regions of low thermal motion was reproducible, whereas solvent molecules containing heavier atoms (such as sulfur) or those located on the surface could differ significantly. The coordination lengths of the calcium ion were conserved. A large proportion of the multiple conformations refined to similar occupancies and the residues adopted similar orientations. More than three quarters of the water-molecule sites were conserved within 0.5 Å and more than one third were conserved within 0.1 Å. An investigation of the protonation states of histidine residues and carboxylate moieties was consistent for all of the models. Radiation-damage effects to disulfide bridges were observed for the same residues and to similar extents. Main-chain bond lengths and angles averaged to similar values and were in agreement with the Engh and Huber targets. Other features, such as peptide flips and the double conformation of the inhibitor molecule, were also reproducible in all of the trypsin structures. Therefore, many details are similar in models obtained from different crystals.

<p>GRL007 and GRL008, two structurally related nonpeptidic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors (PIs) containing 3(R),3a(S),6a(R)-bis-tetrahydrofuranylurethane (bis-THF) as the P2 moiety and a sulfonamide isostere consisting of benzene carboxylic acid and benzene carboxamide as the P2' moiety, respectively, were evaluated for their antiviral activity and interactions with wild-type protease (PR(WT)). Both GRL007 (Ki of 12.7 pM with PR(WT)) and GRL008 (Ki of 8.9 pM) inhibited PR(WT) with high potency in vitro. X-ray crystallographic analysis of PR(WT) in complex with GRL007 or GRL008 showed that the bis-THF moiety of both compounds has three direct polar contacts with the backbone amide nitrogen atoms of Asp29 and Asp30 of PR(WT). The P2' moiety of both compounds showed one direct contact with the backbone of Asp30' and a bridging polar contact with Gly48' through a water molecule. Cell-based antiviral assays showed that GRL007 was inactive (50% effective concentration [EC50] of &gt;1 μM) while GRL008 was highly active (EC50 of 0.04 μM) against wild-type HIV-1. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/mass spectrometry-based cellular uptake assays showed 8.1- and 84-fold higher intracellular concentrations of GRL008 than GRL007 in human MT-2 and MT-4 cell extracts, respectively. Thus, GRL007, in spite of its favorable enzyme-inhibitory activity and protease binding profile, exhibited a lack of antiviral activity in cell-based assays, most likely due to its compromised cellular uptake associated with its P2' benzene carboxylic acid moiety. The anti-HIV-1 potency, favorable toxicity, and binding profile of GRL008 suggest that further optimization of the P2' moiety may improve its antiretroviral features. </p>

<p>HIV protease (HIV PR) is a primary target for anti-HIV drug design. We have previously identified and characterized substituted metallacarboranes as a new class of HIV protease inhibitors. In a structure-guided drug design effort, we connected the two cobalt bis(dicarbollide) clusters with a linker to substituted ammonium group and obtained a set of compounds based on a lead formula [H(2)N-(8-(C(2)H(4)O)(2)-1,2-C(2)B(9)H(10))(1',2'-C(2)B(9)H(11))-3,3'-Co)(2)]Na. We explored inhibition properties of these compounds with various substitutions, determined the HIV PR:inhibitor crystal structure, and computationally explored the conformational space of the linker. Our results prove the capacity of linker-substituted dual-cage cobalt bis(dicarbollides) as lead compounds for design of more potent inhibitors of HIV PR.</p>

<p>Structural studies of proteins usually rely on a model obtained from one crystal. By investigating the details of this model, crystallographers seek to obtain insight into the function of the macromolecule. It is therefore important to know which details of a protein structure are reproducible or to what extent they might differ. To address this question, the high-resolution structures of five crystals of bovine trypsin obtained under analogous conditions were compared. Global parameters and structural details were investigated. All of the models were of similar quality and the pairwise merged intensities had large correlation coefficients. The C(α) and backbone atoms of the structures superposed very well. The occupancy of ligands in regions of low thermal motion was reproducible, whereas solvent molecules containing heavier atoms (such as sulfur) or those located on the surface could differ significantly. The coordination lengths of the calcium ion were conserved. A large proportion of the multiple conformations refined to similar occupancies and the residues adopted similar orientations. More than three quarters of the water-molecule sites were conserved within 0.5 Å and more than one third were conserved within 0.1 Å. An investigation of the protonation states of histidine residues and carboxylate moieties was consistent for all of the models. Radiation-damage effects to disulfide bridges were observed for the same residues and to similar extents. Main-chain bond lengths and angles averaged to similar values and were in agreement with the Engh and Huber targets. Other features, such as peptide flips and the double conformation of the inhibitor molecule, were also reproducible in all of the trypsin structures. Therefore, many details are similar in models obtained from different crystals. However, several features of residues or ligands located in flexible parts of the macromolecule may vary significantly, such as side-chain orientations and the occupancies of certain fragments. </p>

<p>D-alanine:D-alanine ligase (DDl) is an essential enzyme in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and an important target for developing new antibiotics. It catalyzes the formation of D-alanine:D-alanine dipeptide, sequentially by using one D-alanine and one ATP as substrates for the first-half reaction, and a second D-alanine substrate to complete the reaction. Some gain of function DDl mutants can use an alternate second substrate, causing resistance to vancomycin, one of the last lines of defense against life-threatening Gram-positive infections. Here, we report the crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus DDl (StaDDl) and its cocrystal structures with 3-chloro-2,2-dimethyl-N-[4(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propanamide (inhibitor 1) (Ki=4 microM against StaDDl) and with ADP, one of the reaction products, at resolutions of 2.0, 2.2, and 2.6 A, respectively. The overall structure of StaDDl can be divided into three distinct domains. The inhibitor binds to a hydrophobic pocket at the interface of the first and the third domain. This inhibitor-binding pocket is adjacent to the first D-alanine substrate site but does not overlap with any substrate sites. An allosteric inhibition mechanism of StaDDl by this compound was proposed. The mechanism provides the basis for developing new antibiotics targeting D-alanine:D-alanine ligase. Because this compound only interacts with residues from the first D-alanine site, inhibitors with this binding mode potentially could overcome vancomycin resistance.</p>

<p>A detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism of enzymes is an important step toward improving their activity for use in biotechnology. In this paper, crystal soaking experiments and X-ray crystallography were used to analyse the mechanism of the Agrobacterium radiobacter phosphotriesterase, OpdA, an enzyme capable of detoxifying a broad range of organophosphate pesticides. The structures of OpdA complexed with ethylene glycol and the product of dimethoate hydrolysis, dimethyl thiophosphate, provide new details of the catalytic mechanism. These structures suggest that the attacking nucleophile is a terminally bound hydroxide, consistent with the catalytic mechanism of other binuclear metallophosphoesterases. In addition, a crystal structure with the potential substrate trimethyl phosphate bound non-productively demonstrates the importance of the active site cavity in orienting the substrate into an approximation of the transition state.</p>

<p>Berberine bridge enzyme catalyzes the conversion of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine by formation of a carbon-carbon bond between the N-methyl group and the phenolic ring. We elucidated the structure of berberine bridge enzyme from Eschscholzia californica and determined the kinetic rates for three active site protein variants. Here we propose a catalytic mechanism combining base-catalyzed proton abstraction with concerted carbon-carbon coupling accompanied by hydride transfer from the N-methyl group to the N5 atom of the FAD cofactor.</p>

<p>Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 alpha-amylase 2 (TVAII) can efficiently hydrolyze both starch and cyclomaltooligosaccharides (cyclodextrins). The crystal structure of an inactive mutant TVAII in a complex with maltohexaose was determined at a resolution of 2.1A. TVAII adopts a dimeric structure to form two catalytic sites, where substrates are found to bind. At the catalytic site, there are many hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and substrate at the non-reducing end from the hydrolyzing site, but few hydrogen bonds at the reducing end, where two aromatic residues, Trp356 and Tyr45, make effective interactions with a substrate. Trp356 drastically changes its side-chain conformation to achieve a strong stacking interaction with the substrate, and Tyr45 from another molecule forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the substrate. Kinetic analysis of the wild-type and mutant enzymes in which Trp356 and/or Tyr45 were replaced with Ala suggested that Trp356 and Tyr45 are essential to the catalytic reaction of the enzyme, and that the formation of a dimeric structure is indispensable for TVAII to hydrolyze both starch and cyclodextrins.</p>

<p>We are addressing bacterial resistance to antibiotics by repurposing a well-established classic antimicrobial target, the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme. In this work, we have focused on Enterococcus faecalis, a nosocomial pathogen that frequently harbors antibiotic resistance determinants leading to complicated and difficult-to-treat infections. An inhibitor series with a hydrophobic dihydrophthalazine heterocycle was designed from the anti-folate trimethoprim. We have examined the potency of this inhibitor series based on inhibition of DHFR enzyme activity and bacterial growth, including in the presence of the exogenous product analogue folinic acid. The resulting preferences were rationalized using a cocrystal structure of the DHFR from this organism with a propyl-bearing series member (RAB-propyl). In a companion apo structure, we identify four buried waters that act as placeholders for a conserved hydrogen-bonding network to the substrate and indicate an important role in protein stability during catalytic cycling. In these structures, the nicotinamide of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate cofactor is visualized outside of its binding pocket, which is exacerbated by RAB-propyl binding. Finally, homology models of the TMP(R) sequences dfrK and dfrF were constructed. While the dfrK-encoded protein shows clear sequence changes that would be detrimental to inhibitor binding, the dfrF-encoded protein model suggests the protein would be relatively unstable. These data suggest a utility for anti-DHFR compounds for treating infections arising from E. faecalis. They also highlight a role for water in stabilizing the DHFR substrate pocket and for competitive substrate inhibitors that may gain advantages in potency by the perturbation of cofactor dynamics. </p>

<p>Adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase catalyzes the second reaction in the two-step, ATP-dependent conversion of inorganic sulfate to 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). PAPS serves as the sulfuryl donor for the biosynthesis of all sulfate esters and also as a precursor of reduced sulfur biomolecules in many organisms. Previously, we determined the crystal structure of ligand-free APS kinase from the filamentous fungus, Penicillium chrysogenum [MacRae et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 1613-1621]. That structure contained a protease-susceptible disordered region ("mobile lid"; residues 145-170). Addition of MgADP and APS, which together promote the formation of a nonproductive "dead-end" ternary complex, protected the lid from trypsin. This report presents the 1.43 A resolution crystal structure of APS kinase with both ADP and APS bound at the active site and the 2.0 A resolution structure of the enzyme with ADP alone bound. The mobile lid is ordered in both complexes and is shown to provide part of the binding site for APS. That site is formed primarily by the highly conserved Arg 66, Arg 80, and Phe 75 from the protein core and Phe 165 from the mobile lid. The two Phe residues straddle the adenine ring of bound APS. Arg 148, a completely conserved residue, is the only residue in the mobile lid that interacts directly with bound ADP. Ser 34, located in the apex of the P-loop, hydrogen-bonds to the 3'-OH of APS, the phosphoryl transfer target. The structure of the binary E.ADP complex revealed further changes in the active site and N-terminal helix that occur upon the binding/release of (P)APS.</p>

<p>Eukaryotic nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) produce nitric oxide to mediate intercellular signaling and protect against pathogens. Recently, proteins homologous to mammalian NOS oxygenase domains have been found in prokaryotes and one from Bacillus subtilis (bsNOS) has been demonstrated to produce nitric oxide [Adak, S., Aulak, K. S., and Stuehr, D. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 16167-16171]. We present structures of bsNOS complexed with the active cofactor tetrahydrofolate and the substrate L-arginine (L-Arg) or the intermediate N(omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine (NHA) to 1.9 or 2.2 A resolution, respectively. The bsNOS structure is similar to those of the mammalian NOS oxygenase domains (mNOS(ox)) except for the absence of an N-terminal beta-hairpin hook and zinc-binding region that interact with pterin and stabilize the mNOS(ox) dimer. Changes in patterns of residue conservation between bacterial and mammalian NOSs correlate to different binding modes for pterin side chains. Residue conservation on a surface patch surrounding an exposed heme edge indicates a likely interaction site for reductase proteins in all NOSs. The heme pockets of bsNOS and mNOS(ox) recognize L-Arg and NHA similarly, although a change from Val to Ile beside the substrate guanidinium may explain the 10-20-fold slower dissociation of product NO from the bacterial enzyme. Overall, these structures suggest that bsNOS functions naturally to produce nitrogen oxides from L-Arg and NHA in a pterin-dependent manner, but that the regulation and purpose of NO production by NOS may be quite different in B. subtilis than in mammals.</p>

<p>Chorismate lyase (CL) removes the pyruvyl group from chorismate to provide 4-hydroxybenzoate (4HB) for the ubiquinone pathway. We previously reported the crystal structure at 1.4A resolution of the Escherichia coli CL with bound 4HB product, showing that the product is bound in an internal cavity behind two flaps. To provide a more complete basis for understanding CL's unusual ligand-binding properties and mechanism of action, we now report four crystal structures of CL mutants and inhibitor complexes, together with binding and activity measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. First, an ultrahigh resolution (1.0A) crystal structure of the CL*product complex reveals details of a substrate-sized internal cavity, also behind the flaps, near the product site. Second, a 2.4A structure of CL complexed with the inhibitor vanillate shows the flaps partly opened relative to their product-bound positions. Third, a 2.0A structure of the G90A mutant with bound product reveals the basis for tighter product binding and kinetic effects of this active site mutation. Fourth, the combination of the G90A mutation with the vanillate inhibitor produces a 1.9A structure containing two inhibitor molecules, one in the product site and the other in the adjacent cavity. The two sites are connected by a short tunnel that is partly open at each end, suggesting that CL may operate via a 2-site or tunnel mechanism.</p>

<p>Carnitine acyltransferases have crucial functions in fatty acid metabolism. Members of this enzyme family show distinctive substrate preferences for short-, medium- or long-chain fatty acids. The molecular mechanism for this substrate selectivity is not clear as so far only the structure of carnitine acetyltransferase has been determined. To further our understanding of these important enzymes, we report here the crystal structures at up to 2.0-A resolution of mouse carnitine octanoyltransferase alone and in complex with the substrate octanoylcarnitine. The structures reveal significant differences in the acyl group binding pocket between carnitine octanoyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase. Amino acid substitutions and structural changes produce a larger hydrophobic pocket that binds the octanoyl group in an extended conformation. Mutation of a single residue (Gly-553) in this pocket can change the substrate preference between short- and medium-chain acyl groups. The side chains of Cys-323 and Met-335 at the bottom of this pocket assume dual conformations in the substrate complex, and mutagenesis studies suggest that the Met-335 residue is important for catalysis.</p>

<p>We report X-ray crystallographic structures of three inhibitors bound to dehydrosqualene synthase from Staphylococcus aureus: 1 (BPH-651), 2 (WC-9), and 3 (SQ-109). Compound 2 binds to the S2 site with its -SCN group surrounded by four hydrogen bond donors. With 1, we report two structures: in both, the quinuclidine headgroup binds in the allylic (S1) site with the side chain in S2, but in the presence of PPi and Mg(2+), the quinuclidine's cationic center interacts with PPi and three Mg(2+), mimicking a transition state involved in diphosphate ionization. With 3, there are again two structures. In one, the geranyl side chain binds to either S1 or S2 and the adamantane headgroup binds to S1. In the second, the side chain binds to S2 while the headgroup binds to S1. These results provide structural clues for the mechanism and inhibition of the head-to-head prenyl transferases and should aid future drug design.</p>

<p>1,2-alpha-L-fucosidase (AfcA), which hydrolyzes the glycosidic linkage of Fucalpha1-2Gal via an inverting mechanism, was recently isolated from Bifidobacterium bifidum and classified as the first member of the novel glycoside hydrolase family 95. To better understand the molecular mechanism of this enzyme, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of the AfcA catalytic (Fuc) domain in unliganded and complexed forms with deoxyfuconojirimycin (inhibitor), 2'-fucosyllactose (substrate), and L-fucose and lactose (products) at 1.12-2.10 A resolution. The AfcA Fuc domain is composed of four regions, an N-terminal beta region, a helical linker, an (alpha/alpha)6 helical barrel domain, and a C-terminal beta region, and this arrangement is similar to bacterial phosphorylases. In the complex structures, the ligands were buried in the central cavity of the helical barrel domain. Structural analyses in combination with mutational experiments revealed that the highly conserved Glu566 probably acts as a general acid catalyst. However, no carboxylic acid residue is found at the appropriate position for a general base catalyst. Instead, a water molecule stabilized by Asn423 in the substrate-bound complex is suitably located to perform a nucleophilic attack on the C1 atom of L-fucose moiety in 2'-fucosyllactose, and its location is nearly identical near the O1 atom of beta-L-fucose in the products-bound complex. Based on these data, we propose and discuss a novel catalytic reaction mechanism of AfcA.</p>

<p>Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS; EC 2.2.1.6) is the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids. It catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of pyruvate into 2-acetolactate or one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of 2-ketobutyrate into 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate. AHAS requires the cofactors thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), Mg(2+) and FAD for activity. The herbicides that target this enzyme are effective in protecting a broad range of crops from weed species. However, resistance in the field is now a serious problem worldwide. To address this, two new sulfonylureas, monosulfuron and monosulfuron ester, have been developed as commercial herbicides in China. These molecules differ from the traditional sulfonylureas in that the heterocyclic ring attached to the nitrogen atom of the sulfonylurea bridge is monosubstituted rather than disubstituted. The structures of these compounds in complex with the catalytic subunit of Arabidopsis thaliana AHAS have been determined to 3.0 and 2.8 A, respectively. In both complexes, these molecules are bound in the tunnel leading to the active site, such that the sole substituent of the heterocyclic ring is buried deepest and oriented towards the ThDP. Unlike the structures of Arabidopsis thaliana AHAS in complex with the classic disubstituted sulfonylureas, where ThDP is broken, this cofactor is intact and present most likely as the hydroxylethyl intermediate.</p>

<p>alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase (alpha3GalT, EC 2.4.1.151) is a Golgi-resident, type II transmembrane protein that transfers galactose from UDP-alpha-galactose to the terminal N:-acetyllactosamine unit of glycoconjugate glycans, producing the Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc oligosaccharide structure present in most mammalian glycoproteins. Unlike most other mammals, humans and Old World primates do not possess alpha3GalT activity, which is relevant for the hyperacute rejection observed in pig-to-human xenotransplantation. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of substrate-free bovine alpha3GalT, solved and refined to 2.3 A resolution, has a globular shape with an alpha/beta fold containing a narrow cleft on one face, and shares a UDP-binding domain (UBD) with the recently solved inverting glycosyltransferases. The substrate-bound complex, solved and refined to 2.5 A, allows the description of residues interacting directly with UDP-galactose. These structural data suggest that the strictly conserved residue E317 is likely to be the catalytic nucleophile involved in galactose transfer with retention of anomeric configuration as accomplished by this enzyme. Moreover, the alpha3GalT structure helps to identify amino acid residues that determine the specificities of the highly homologous ABO histo-blood group and glycosphingolipid glycosyltransferases.</p>

<p>Isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis occurs through the mevalonate or the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, used i.e., by humans and by many human pathogens, respectively. In the MEP pathway, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclo-diphosphate (MEcPP) is converted to (E)-1-hydroxy-2-methyl-but-2-enyl-4-diphosphate (HMBPP) by the iron-sulfur cluster enzyme HMBPP synthase (GcpE). The presented X-ray structure of the GcpE-MEcPP complex from Thermus thermophilus at 1.55Å resolution provides valuable information about the catalytic mechanism and for rational inhibitor design. MEcPP binding inside the TIM-barrel funnel induces a 60° rotation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster containing domain onto the TIM-barrel entrance. The apical iron of the [4Fe-4S] cluster ligates with the C3 oxygen atom of MEcPP.</p>

<p>A major concern of immunocompromised patients, in particular those with AIDS, is susceptibility to infection caused by opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, which is a leading cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. We report the first kinetic and structural data for 2,4-diamino-6-[(2',5'-dichloro anilino)methyl]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (OAAG324), a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from P. jirovecii (pjDHFR), and also for trimethoprim (TMP) and methotrexate (MTX) with pjDHFR, Pneumocystis carinii DHFR (pcDHFR), and human DHFR (hDHFR). OAAG324 shows a 9.0-fold selectivity for pjDHFR (Ki, 2.7 nM) compared to its selectivity for hDHFR (Ki, 24.4 nM), whereas there is only a 2.3-fold selectivity for pcDHFR (Ki, 6.3 nM). In order to understand the determinants of inhibitory potency, active-site mutations of pj-, pc-, and hDHFR were explored to make these enzymes more like each other. The most unexpected observations were that the variant pcDHFR forms with K37Q and K37Q/F69N mutations, which made the enzyme more like the human form, also made these enzymes more sensitive to the inhibitory activity of OAAG324, with Ki values of 0.26 and 0.71 nM, respectively. A similar gain in sensitivity was also observed for the hDHFR N64F variant, which showed a lower Ki value (0.58 nM) than native hDHFR, pcDHFR, or pjDHFR. Structural data are reported for complexes of OAAG324 with hDHFR and its Q35K and Q35S/N64F variants and for the complex of the K37S/F69N variant of pcDHFR with TMP. These results provide useful insight into the role of these residues in the optimization of highly selective inhibitors of DHFR against the opportunistic pathogen P. jirovecii.</p>

<p>Synthesis of thrombin inhibitors and their binding mode to thrombin is described. Modification of the P1 moiety leads to an increased selectivity versus trypsin. The observed selectivity is discussed in view of their thrombin-inhibitor complex X-ray structures.</p>

<p>Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), biosynthetic enzymes of bacterial cell wall assembly, and beta-lactamases, resistance enzymes to beta-lactam antibiotics, are related to each other from an evolutionary point of view. Massova and Mobashery (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998, 42, 1-17) have proposed that for beta-lactamases to have become effective at their function as antibiotic resistance enzymes, they would have had to undergo structure alterations such that they would not interact with the peptidoglycan, which is the substrate for PBPs. A cephalosporin analogue, 7beta-[N-Acetyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysine]-3-acetoxymethyl-3-cephem-carboxylic acid (compound 6), was conceived and synthesized to test this notion. The X-ray structure of the complex of this cephalosporin bound to the active site of the deacylation-deficient Q120L/Y150E variant of the class C AmpC beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli was solved at 1.71 A resolution. This complex revealed that the surface for interaction with the strand of peptidoglycan that acylates the active site, which is present in PBPs, is absent in the -lactamase active site. Furthermore, insertion of a peptide in the beta-lactamase active site at a location where the second strand of peptidoglycan in some PBPs binds has effectively abolished the possibility for such interaction with the beta-lactamase. A 2.6 ns dynamics simulation was carried out for the complex, which revealed that the peptidoglycan surrogate (i.e., the active-site-bound ligand) undergoes substantial motion and is not stabilized for binding within the active site. These factors taken together disclose the set of structure modifications in the antibiotic resistance enzyme that prevent it from interacting with the peptidoglycan, en route to achieving catalytic proficiency for their intended function.</p>

<p>We report the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structure of the Lip2 lipase from Yarrowia lipolytica in its closed conformation. The Lip2 structure is highly homologous to known structures of the fungal lipase family (Thermomyces lanuginosa, Rhizopus niveus, and Rhizomucor miehei lipases). However, it also presents some unique features that are described and discussed here in detail. Structural differences, in particular in the conformation adopted by the so-called lid subdomain, suggest that the opening mechanism of Lip2 may differ from that of other fungal lipases. Because the catalytic activity of lipases is strongly dependent on structural rearrangement of this mobile subdomain, we focused on elucidating the molecular mechanism of lid motion. Using the x-ray structure of Lip2, we carried out extensive molecular-dynamics simulations in explicit solvent environments (water and water/octane interface) to characterize the major structural rearrangements that the lid undergoes under the influence of solvent or upon substrate binding. Overall, our results suggest a two-step opening mechanism that gives rise first to a semi-open conformation upon adsorption of the protein at the water/organic solvent interface, followed by a further opening of the lid upon substrate binding.</p>

<p>Class II ribonucleotide reductases (RNR) catalyze the formation of an essential thiyl radical by homolytic cleavage of the Co-C bond in their adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) cofactor. Several mechanisms for the dramatic acceleration of Co-C bond cleavage in AdoCbl-dependent enzymes have been advanced, but no consensus yet exists. We present the structure of the class II RNR from Thermotoga maritima in three complexes: (i) with allosteric effector dTTP, substrate GDP, and AdoCbl; (ii) with dTTP and AdoCbl; (iii) with dTTP, GDP, and adenosine. Comparison of these structures gives the deepest structural insights so far into the mechanism of radical generation and transfer for AdoCbl-dependent RNR. AdoCbl binds to the active site pocket, shielding the substrate, transient 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and nascent thiyl radical from solution. The e-propionamide side chain of AdoCbl forms hydrogen bonds directly to the α-phosphate group of the substrate. This interaction appears to cause a "locking-in" of the cofactor, and it is the first observation of a direct cofactor-substrate interaction in an AdoCbl-dependent enzyme. The structures support an ordered sequential reaction mechanism with release or relaxation of AdoCbl on each catalytic cycle. A conformational change of the AdoCbl adenosyl ribose is required to allow hydrogen transfer to the catalytic thiol group. Previously proposed mechanisms for radical transfer in B12-dependent enzymes cannot fully explain the transfer in class II RNR, suggesting that it may form a separate class that differs from the well-characterized eliminases and mutases.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of many enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily determined in the presence of bound NAD(P)(+) have exhibited conformational flexibility for the nicotinamide half of the cofactor. This has been hypothesized to be important in catalysis because one conformation would block the second half of the reaction, but no firm evidence has been put forth which shows whether the oxidized and reduced cofactors preferentially occupy the two observed conformations. We present here two structures of the wild type and two structures of a Cys302Ser mutant of human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in binary complexes with NAD(+) and NADH. These structures, including the Cys302Ser mutant in complex with NAD(+) at 1.4 A resolution and the wild-type enzyme in complex with NADH at 1.9 A resolution, provide strong evidence that bound NAD(+) prefers an extended conformation ideal for hydride transfer and bound NADH prefers a contracted conformation ideal for acyl-enzyme hydrolysis. Unique interactions between the cofactor and the Rossmann fold make isomerization possible while allowing the remainder of the active site complex to remain intact. In addition, these structures clarify the role of magnesium in activating the human class 2 enzyme. Our data suggest that the presence of magnesium may lead to selection of particular conformations and speed isomerization of the reduced cofactor following hydride transfer.</p>

<p>Nuclease resistance and RNA affinity are key criteria in the search for optimal antisense nucleic acid modifications, but the origins of the various levels of resistance to nuclease degradation conferred by chemical modification of DNA and RNA are currently not understood. The 2'-O-aminopropyl (AP)-RNA modification displays the highest nuclease resistance among all phosphodiester-based analogues and its RNA binding affinity surpasses that of phosphorothioate DNA by 1 degrees C per modified residue. We found that oligodeoxynucleotides containing AP-RNA residues at their 3' ends competitively inhibit the degradation of single-stranded DNA by the Escherichia coli Klenow fragment (KF) 3'-5' exonuclease and snake venom phosphodiesterase. To shed light on the origins of nuclease resistance brought about by the AP modification, we determined the crystal structure of an A-form DNA duplex with AP-RNA modifications at 1.6-A resolution. In addition, the crystal structures of complexes between short DNA fragments carrying AP-RNA modifications and wild-type KF were determined at resolutions between 2.2 and 3.0 A and compared with the structure of the complex between oligo(dT) and the D355A/E357A KF mutant. The structural models suggest that interference of the positively charged 2'-O-substituent with the metal ion binding site B of the exonuclease allows AP-RNA to effectively slow down degradation.</p>

<p>Salmonella typhimurium DCyD (StDCyD) is a fold type II pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of D-Cys to H(2)S and pyruvate. It also efficiently degrades β-chloro-D-alanine (βCDA). D-Ser is a poor substrate while the enzyme is inactive with respect to L-Ser and 1-amino-1-carboxy cyclopropane (ACC). Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of StDCyD and of crystals obtained in the presence of D-Cys, βCDA, ACC, D-Ser, L-Ser, D-cycloserine (DCS) and L-cycloserine (LCS) at resolutions ranging from 1.7 to 2.6 Å. The polypeptide fold of StDCyD consisting of a small domain (residues 48-161) and a large domain (residues 1-47 and 162-328) resembles other fold type II PLP dependent enzymes. The structures obtained in the presence of D-Cys and βCDA show the product, pyruvate, bound at a site 4.0-6.0 Å away from the active site. ACC forms an external aldimine complex while D- and L-Ser bind non-covalently suggesting that the reaction with these ligands is arrested at Cα proton abstraction and transimination steps, respectively. In the active site of StDCyD cocrystallized with DCS or LCS, electron density for a pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) was observed. Crystals soaked in cocktail containing these ligands show density for PLP-cycloserine. Spectroscopic observations also suggest formation of PMP by the hydrolysis of cycloserines. Mutational studies suggest that Ser78 and Gln77 are key determinants of enzyme specificity and the phenolate of Tyr287 is responsible for Cα proton abstraction from D-Cys. Based on these studies, a probable mechanism for the degradation of D-Cys by StDCyD is proposed.</p>

<p>The hexameric purine nucleoside phosphorylase from Bacillus subtilis (BsPNP233) displays great potential to produce nucleoside analogues in industry and can be exploited in the development of new anti-tumor gene therapies. In order to provide structural basis for enzyme and substrates rational optimization, aiming at those applications, the present work shows a thorough and detailed structural description of the binding mode of substrates and nucleoside analogues to the active site of the hexameric BsPNP233. Here we report the crystal structure of BsPNP233 in the apo form and in complex with 11 ligands, including clinically relevant compounds. The crystal structure of six ligands (adenine, 2'deoxyguanosine, aciclovir, ganciclovir, 8-bromoguanosine, 6-chloroguanosine) in complex with a hexameric PNP are presented for the first time. Our data showed that free bases adopt alternative conformations in the BsPNP233 active site and indicated that binding of the co-substrate (2'deoxy)ribose 1-phosphate might contribute for stabilizing the bases in a favorable orientation for catalysis. The BsPNP233-adenosine complex revealed that a hydrogen bond between the 5' hydroxyl group of adenosine and Arg(43*) side chain contributes for the ribosyl radical to adopt an unusual C3'-endo conformation. The structures with 6-chloroguanosine and 8-bromoguanosine pointed out that the Cl(6) and Br(8) substrate modifications seem to be detrimental for catalysis and can be explored in the design of inhibitors for hexameric PNPs from pathogens. Our data also corroborated the competitive inhibition mechanism of hexameric PNPs by tubercidin and suggested that the acyclic nucleoside ganciclovir is a better inhibitor for hexameric PNPs than aciclovir. Furthermore, comparative structural analyses indicated that the replacement of Ser(90) by a threonine in the B. cereus hexameric adenosine phosphorylase (Thr(91)) is responsible for the lack of negative cooperativity of phosphate binding in this enzyme.</p>

<p>Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE, a zinc dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase) is a major target of drugs due to its role in the modulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular disorders. Here we present a crystal structure of AnCE (an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster with a single enzymatic domain) in complex with a natural product-phosphonotripeptide, K-26 at 1.96A resolution. The inhibitor binds exclusively in the S(1) and S(2) binding pockets of AnCE (coordinating the zinc ion) through ionic and hydrogen bond interactions. A detailed structural comparison of AnCE.K-26 complex with individual domains of human somatic ACE provides useful information for further exploration of ACE inhibitor pharmacophores involving phosphonic acids.</p>

<p>We present here the first experimental evidence for bound substrate in the active site of a rhamnogalacturonan lyase belonging to family 4 of polysaccharide lyases, Aspergillus aculeatus rhamnogalacturonan lyase (RGL4). RGL4 is involved in the degradation of rhamnogalacturonan-I, an important pectic plant cell wall polysaccharide. Based on the previously determined wild-type structure, enzyme variants RGL4_H210A and RGL4_K150A have been produced and characterized both kinetically and structurally, showing that His210 and Lys150 are key active-site residues. Crystals of the RGL4_K150A variant soaked with a rhamnogalacturonan digest gave a clear picture of substrate bound in the -3/+3 subsites. The crystallographic and kinetic studies on RGL4, and structural and sequence comparison to other enzymes in the same and other PL families, enable us to propose a detailed reaction mechanism for the β-elimination on [-,2)-α-l-rhamno-(1,4)-α-d-galacturonic acid-(1,-]. The mechanism differs significantly from the one established for pectate lyases, in which most often calcium ions are engaged in catalysis.</p>

<p>ATP-dependent Lon proteases catalyze the degradation of various regulatory proteins and abnormal proteins within cells. Methanococcus jannaschii Lon (Mj-Lon) is a homologue of Escherichia coli Lon (Ec-Lon) but has two transmembrane helices within its N-terminal ATPase domain. We solved the crystal structure of the proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion, refining it to 1.9-angstroms resolution. The structure displays an overall fold conserved in the proteolytic domain of Ec-Lon; however, the active site shows uniquely configured catalytic Ser-Lys-Asp residues that are not seen in Ec-Lon, which contains a catalytic dyad. In Mj-Lon, the C-terminal half of the beta4-alpha2 segment is an alpha-helix, whereas it is a beta-strand in Ec-Lon. Consequently, the configurations of the active sites differ due to the formation of a salt bridge between Asp-547 and Lys-593 in Mj-Lon. Moreover, unlike Ec-Lon, Mj-Lon has a buried cavity in the region of the active site containing three water molecules, one of which is hydrogen-bonded to catalytic Ser-550. The geometry and environment of the active site residues in Mj-Lon suggest that the charged Lys-593 assists in lowering the pK(a) of the Ser-550 hydroxyl group via its electrostatic potential, and the water in the cavity acts as a proton acceptor during catalysis. Extensive sequence alignment and comparison of the structures of the proteolytic domains clearly indicate that Lon proteases can be classified into two groups depending on active site configuration and the presence of DGPSA or (D/E)GDSA consensus sequences, as represented by Ec-Lon and Mj-Lon.</p>

<p>It is known that HIV-1 protease is an important target for design of antiviral compounds in the treatment of Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In this context, understanding the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme is of crucial importance as transition state structure directs inhibitor design. Most mechanistic proposals invoke nucleophilic attack on the scissile peptide bond by a water molecule. But such a water molecule coexisting with any ligand in the active site has not been found so far in the crystal structures.</p>

<p>Organophosphonates such as isopropyl metylphosphonofluoridate (sarin) are extremely toxic as they phosphonylate the catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme essential to humans and other species. Design of effective AChE reactivators as antidotes to various organophosphonates requires information on how the reactivators interact with the phosphonylated AChEs. However, such information has not been available hitherto because of three main challenges. First, reactivators are generally flexible in order to change from the ground state to the transition state for reactivation; this flexibility discourages determination of crystal structures of AChE in complex with effective reactivators that are intrinsically disordered. Second, reactivation occurs upon binding of a reactivator to the phosphonylated AChE. Third, the phosphorous conjugate can develop resistance to reactivation. We have identified crystallographic conditions that led to the determination of a crystal structure of the sarin(nonaged)-conjugated mouse AChE in complex with [(E)-[1-[(4-carbamoylpyridin-1-ium-1-yl)methoxymethyl]pyridin-2-ylidene]methyl]-oxoazanium dichloride (HI-6) at a resolution of 2.2 A. In this structure, the carboxyamino-pyridinium ring of HI-6 is sandwiched by Tyr124 and Trp286, however, the oxime-pyridinium ring is disordered. By combining crystallography with microsecond molecular dynamics simulation, we determined the oxime-pyridinium ring structure, which shows that the oxime group of HI-6 can form a hydrogen-bond network to the sarin isopropyl ether oxygen, and a water molecule is able to form a hydrogen bond to the catalytic histidine residue and subsequently deprotonates the oxime for reactivation. These results offer insights into the reactivation mechanism of HI-6 and design of better reactivators.</p>

<p>A series of HIV protease inhibitor based on the allophenylnorstatine structure with various P(2)' moieties were synthesized. Among these analogues, we discovered that a small allyl group would maintain potent enzyme inhibitory activity compared to the o-methylbenzyl moiety in clinical candidate 1 (KNI-764, also known as JE-2147, AG-1776, or SM-319777). Introduction of an anilinic amino group to 2 (KNI-727) improved water-solubility and anti-HIV-1 activity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of 13k (KNI-1689) with a beta-methallyl group at P(2)' position revealed hydrophobic interactions with Ala28, Ile84, and Ile50' similar to that of 1. The presence of an additional methyl group on the allyl group in compound 13k significantly increased anti-HIV activity over 1 while providing a rational drug design for structural minimization and improving membrane permeability.</p>

<p>Evolutionary advances are often fueled by unanticipated innovation. Directed evolution of a computationally designed enzyme suggests that pronounced molecular changes can also drive the optimization of primitive protein active sites. The specific activity of an artificial retro-aldolase was boosted &gt;4,400-fold by random mutagenesis and screening, affording catalytic efficiencies approaching those of natural enzymes. However, structural and mechanistic studies reveal that the engineered catalytic apparatus, consisting of a reactive lysine and an ordered water molecule, was unexpectedly abandoned in favor of a new lysine residue in a substrate-binding pocket created during the optimization process. Structures of the initial in silico design, a mechanistically promiscuous intermediate and one of the most evolved variants highlight the importance of loop mobility and supporting functional groups in the emergence of the new catalytic center. Such internal competition between alternative reactive sites may have characterized the early evolution of many natural enzymes. </p>

<p>The nitric oxide molecule (NO) is involved in many important physiological processes and seems to be stabilized by reduced thiol species, such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). GSNO binds strongly to glutathione transferases, a major superfamily of detoxifying enzymes. We have determined the crystal structure of GSNO bound to dimeric human glutathione transferase P1-1 (hGSTP1-1) at 1.4 A resolution. The GSNO ligand binds in the active site with the nitrosyl moiety involved in multiple interactions with the protein. Isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) have been used to characterize the interaction of GSNO with the enzyme. The binding of GSNO to wild-type hGSTP1-1 induces a negative cooperativity with a kinetic process concomitant to the binding process occurring at more physiological temperatures. GSNO inhibits wild-type enzyme competitively at lower temperatures but covalently at higher temperatures, presumably by S-nitrosylation of a sulfhydryl group. The C47S mutation removes the covalent modification potential of the enzyme by GSNO. These results are consistent with a model in which the flexible helix alpha2 of hGST P1-1 must move sufficiently to allow chemical modification of Cys47. In contrast to wild-type enzyme, the C47S mutation induces a positive cooperativity toward GSNO binding. The DSC results show that the thermal stability of the mutant is slightly higher than wild type, consistent with helix alpha2 forming new interactions with the other subunit. All these results suggest that Cys47 plays a key role in intersubunit cooperativity and that under certain pathological conditions S-nitrosylation of Cys47 by GSNO is a likely physiological scenario.</p>

<p>The human eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), also known as RNase 3, is an eosinophil secretion protein that is involved in innate immunity and displays antipathogen and proinflammatory activities. ECP has a high binding affinity for heterosaccharides, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides and heparan sulfate found in the glycocalix of eukaryotic cells. We have crystallized ECP in complex with sulfate anions in a new monoclinic crystal form. In this form, the active site groove is exposed, providing an alternative model for ligand binding studies. By exploring the protein-sulfate complex, we have defined the sulfate binding site architecture. Three main sites (S1-S3) are located in the protein active site; S1 and S2 overlap with the phosphate binding sites involved in RNase nucleotide recognition. A new site (S3) that is unique to ECP is one of the key anchoring points for sulfated ligands. Arg 1 and Arg 7 in S3, together with Arg 34 and Arg 36 in S1, form the main basic clusters that assist in the recognition of ligand anionic groups. The location of additional sulfate bound molecules, some of which contribute to the crystal packing, may mimic the binding to extended anionic polymers. In conclusion, the structural data define a binding pattern for the recognition of sulfated molecules that can modulate the role of ECP in innate immunity. The results reveal the structural basis for the high affinity of ECP for glycosaminoglycans and can assist in structure-based drug design of inhibitors of the protein cytotoxicity to host tissues during inflammation.</p>

<p>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an essential enzyme that terminates cholinergic transmission by rapid hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Compounds inhibiting this enzyme can be used (inter alia) to treat cholinergic deficiencies (e.g. in Alzheimer's disease), but may also act as dangerous toxins (e.g. nerve agents such as sarin). Treatment of nerve agent poisoning involves use of antidotes, small molecules capable of reactivating AChE. We have screened a collection of organic molecules to assess their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of AChE, aiming to find lead compounds for further optimization leading to drugs with increased efficacy and/or decreased side effects. 124 inhibitors were discovered, with considerable chemical diversity regarding size, polarity, flexibility and charge distribution. An extensive structure determination campaign resulted in a set of crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes. Overall, the ligands have substantial interactions with the peripheral anionic site of AChE, and the majority form additional interactions with the catalytic site (CAS). Reproduction of the bioactive conformation of six of the ligands using molecular docking simulations required modification of the default parameter settings of the docking software. The results show that docking-assisted structure-based design of AChE inhibitors is challenging and requires crystallographic support to obtain reliable results, at least with currently available software. The complex formed between C5685 and Mus musculus AChE (C5685•mAChE) is a representative structure for the general binding mode of the determined structures. The CAS binding part of C5685 could not be structurally determined due to a disordered electron density map and the developed docking protocol was used to predict the binding modes of this part of the molecule. We believe that chemical modifications of our discovered inhibitors, biochemical and biophysical characterization, crystallography and computational chemistry provide a route to novel AChE inhibitors and reactivators.</p>

<p>Conventional isoforms (alpha, beta and gamma) of protein kinase C (PKC) are synergistically activated by phosphatidylserine and Ca2+; both bind to C2 domains located within the PKC amino-terminal regulatory regions.

Neither the structural basis for cooperativity between phosphatidylserine and Ca2+, nor the binding site for phosphatidylserine are known.</p>

<p>The search for antituberculosis drugs active against persistent bacilli has led to our interest in metallodependent class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA-tb), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis absent from mammalian cells. Knock-out experiments at the fba-tb locus indicated that this gene is required for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on gluconeogenetic substrates and in glucose-containing medium. Surface labeling and enzymatic activity measurements revealed that this enzyme was exported to the cell surface of M. tuberculosis and produced under various axenic growth conditions including oxygen depletion and hence by non-replicating bacilli. Importantly, FBA-tb was also produced in vivo in the lungs of infected guinea pigs and mice. FBA-tb bound human plasmin(ogen) and protected FBA-tb-bound plasmin from regulation by α(2)-antiplasmin, suggestive of an involvement of this enzyme in host/pathogen interactions. The crystal structures of FBA-tb in the native form and in complex with a hydroxamate substrate analog were determined to 2.35- and 1.9-Å resolution, respectively. Whereas inhibitor attachment had no effect on the plasminogen binding activity of FBA-tb, it competed with the natural substrate of the enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and substantiated a previously unknown reaction mechanism associated with metallodependent aldolases involving recruitment of the catalytic zinc ion by the substrate upon active site binding. Altogether, our results highlight the potential of FBA-tb as a novel therapeutic target against both replicating and non-replicating bacilli.</p>

<p>The nitric oxide molecule (NO) is involved in many important physiological processes and seems to be stabilized by reduced thiol species, such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). GSNO binds strongly to glutathione transferases, a major superfamily of detoxifying enzymes. We have determined the crystal structure of GSNO bound to dimeric human glutathione transferase P1-1 (hGSTP1-1) at 1.4 A resolution. The GSNO ligand binds in the active site with the nitrosyl moiety involved in multiple interactions with the protein. Isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) have been used to characterize the interaction of GSNO with the enzyme. The binding of GSNO to wild-type hGSTP1-1 induces a negative cooperativity with a kinetic process concomitant to the binding process occurring at more physiological temperatures. GSNO inhibits wild-type enzyme competitively at lower temperatures but covalently at higher temperatures, presumably by S-nitrosylation of a sulfhydryl group. The C47S mutation removes the covalent modification potential of the enzyme by GSNO. These results are consistent with a model in which the flexible helix alpha2 of hGST P1-1 must move sufficiently to allow chemical modification of Cys47. In contrast to wild-type enzyme, the C47S mutation induces a positive cooperativity toward GSNO binding. The DSC results show that the thermal stability of the mutant is slightly higher than wild type, consistent with helix alpha2 forming new interactions with the other subunit. All these results suggest that Cys47 plays a key role in intersubunit cooperativity and that under certain pathological conditions S-nitrosylation of Cys47 by GSNO is a likely physiological scenario.</p>

<p>Concatenation of engineered biocatalysts into multistep pathways markedly increases their utility, but the development of generalizable assembly methods remains a major challenge. Herein we evaluate 'bioretrosynthesis', which is an application of the retrograde evolution hypothesis, for biosynthetic pathway construction. To test bioretrosynthesis, we engineered a pathway for synthesis of the antiretroviral nucleoside analog didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine). Applying both directed evolution- and structure-based approaches, we began pathway construction with a retro-extension from an engineered purine nucleoside phosphorylase and evolved 1,5-phosphopentomutase to accept the substrate 2,3-dideoxyribose 5-phosphate with a 700-fold change in substrate selectivity and threefold increased turnover in cell lysate. A subsequent retrograde pathway extension, via ribokinase engineering, resulted in a didanosine pathway with a 9,500-fold change in nucleoside production selectivity and 50-fold increase in didanosine production. Unexpectedly, the result of this bioretrosynthetic step was not a retro-extension from phosphopentomutase but rather the discovery of a fortuitous pathway-shortening bypass via the engineered ribokinase. </p>

<p>Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a target for antifolate-based chemotherapies of microbial and human diseases. Here, ligand-based, synthetic, and X-ray crystallography studies led to the discovery of 6-(3-cyanobenzoyloxy)-2-oxo-2H-naphto[1,8-bc]furan, a novel inhibitor with a Ki of 310 nM against Pneumocystis carinii TS. The X-ray ternary complex with Escherichia coli TS revealed, for the first time, displacement of the substrate toward the dimeric protein interface, thus providing new opportunities for further design of specific inhibitors of microbial pathogens. </p>

<p>UDP-galactose 4-epimerase catalyzes the interconversion of UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc during normal galactose metabolism. The mammalian form of the enzyme, unlike its Escherichia coli counterpart, can also interconvert UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc. One key feature of the epimerase reaction mechanism is the rotation of a 4-ketopyranose intermediate in the active site. By comparing the high resolution x-ray structures of both the bacterial and human forms of the enzyme, it was previously postulated that the additional activity in the human epimerase was due to replacement of the structural equivalent of Tyr-299 in the E. coli enzyme with a cysteine residue, thereby leading to a larger active site volume. To test this hypothesis, the Y299C mutant form of the E. coli enzyme was prepared and its three-dimensional structure solved as described here. Additionally, the Y299C mutant protein was assayed for activity against both UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc. These studies have revealed that, indeed, this simple mutation did confer UDP-GalNAc/UDP-GlcNAc converting activity to the bacterial enzyme with minimal changes in its three-dimensional structure. Specifically, although the Y299C mutation in the bacterial enzyme resulted in a loss of epimerase activity with regard to UDP-Gal by almost 5-fold, it resulted in a gain of activity against UDP-GalNAc by more than 230-fold.</p>

<p>Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase catalyzes the transfer of the pyrophosphate group from ATP to ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) yielding PRPP and AMP. PRPP is an essential metabolite that plays a central role in cellular metabolism. The enzyme from a thermophilic archaeon Thermoplasma volcanium (Tv) was expressed in Escherichia coli, crystallized, and its X-ray molecular structure was determined in a complex with its substrate R5P and with substrate analogs β,γ-methylene ATP and ADP in two monoclinic crystal forms, P2(1). The β,γ-methylene ATP- and the ADP-bound binary structures were determined from crystals grown from ammonium sulfate solutions; these crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å and 1.5 Å resolutions, respectively. Crystals of the ternary complex with ADP-Mg(2+) and R5P were grown from a polyethylene glycol solution in the absence of sulfate ions, and they diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution; the unit cell is approximately double the size of the unit cell of the crystals grown in the presence of sulfate. The Tv PRPP synthetase adopts two conformations, open and closed, at different stages in the catalytic cycle. The binding of substrates, R5P and ATP, occurs with PRPP synthetase in the open conformation, whereas catalysis presumably takes place with PRPP synthetase in the closed conformation. The Tv PRPP synthetase forms a biological dimer in contrast to the tetrameric or hexameric quaternary structures of the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Bacillus subtilis PRPP synthetases, respectively.</p>

<p>Small proteins are generally observed to fold in an apparent two-state manner. Recently, however, more sensitive techniques have demonstrated that even seemingly single-domain proteins are actually made up of smaller subdomains. T4 lysozyme is one such protein. We explored the relative autonomy of its two individual subdomains and their contribution to the overall stability of T4 lysozyme by examining a circular permutation (CP13*) that relocates the N-terminal A-helix, creating subdomains that are contiguous in sequence. By determining the high-resolution structure of CP13* and characterizing its energy landscape using native state hydrogen exchange (NSHX), we show that connectivity between the subdomains is an important determinant of the energetic cooperativity but not structural integrity of the protein. The circular permutation results in a protein more easily able to populate a partially unfolded form in which the C-terminal subdomain is folded and the N-terminal subdomain is unfolded. We also created a fragment model of this intermediate and demonstrate using X-ray crystallography that its structure is identical to the corresponding residues in the full-length protein with the exception of a small network of hydrophobic interactions. In sum, we conclude that the C-terminal subdomain dominates the energetics of T4 lysozyme folding, and the A-helix serves an important role in coupling the two subdomains.</p>

<p>Aromatic amino acid ammonia-lyases catalyze the deamination of L-His, L-Phe, and L-Tyr, yielding ammonia plus aryl acids bearing an alpha,beta-unsaturated propenoic acid. We report crystallographic analyses of unliganded Rhodobacter sphaeroides tyrosine ammonia-lyase (RsTAL) and RsTAL bound to p-coumarate and caffeate. His 89 of RsTAL forms a hydrogen bond with the p-hydroxyl moieties of coumarate and caffeate. His 89 is conserved in TALs but replaced in phenylalanine ammonia-lyases (PALs) and histidine ammonia-lyases (HALs). Substitution of His 89 by Phe, a characteristic residue of PALs, yields a mutant with a switch in kinetic preference from L-Tyr to L-Phe. Structures of the H89F mutant in complex with the PAL product, cinnamate, or the PAL-specific inhibitor, 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonate (AIP), support the role of position 89 as a specificity determinant in the family of aromatic amino acid ammonia-lyases and aminomutases responsible for beta-amino acid biosynthesis.</p>

<p>3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) catalyzes the reaction between three-carbon phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and five-carbon d-arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P), generating KDO8P, a key intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway to 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate, a component of the lipopolysaccharide of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Both metal-dependent and metal-independent forms of KDO8PS have been characterized. KDO8PS is evolutionarily and mechanistically related to the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway, the obligately divalent metal ion-dependent 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) that couples PEP and four-carbon D-erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) to give DAH7P. In KDO8PS, an absolutely conserved KANRS motif forms part of the A5P binding site, whereas in DAH7PS, an absolutely conserved KPR(S/T) motif accommodates E4P. Here, we have characterized four mutants of this motif (AANRS, KAARS, KARS, and KPRS) in metal-dependent KDO8PS from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and metal-independent KDO8PS from Neisseria meningitidis to test the roles of the universal Lys and the Ala-Asn portion of the KANRS motif. The X-ray structures, determined for the N. meningitidis KDO8PS mutants, indicated no gross structural penalty resulting from mutation, but the subtle changes observed in the active sites of these mutant proteins correlated with their altered catalytic function. (1) The AANRS mutations destroyed catalytic activity. (2) The KAARS mutations lowered substrate selectivity, as well as activity. (3) Replacing KANRS with KARS or KPRS destroyed KDO8PS activity but did not produce a functional DAH7PS. Thus, Lys is critical to catalysis, and other changes are necessary to switch substrate specificity for both the metal-independent and metal-dependent forms of these enzymes.</p>

<p>Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKO) is a flavoenzyme, which irreversibly degrades the plant hormones cytokinins and thereby participates in their homeostasis. Several synthetic cytokinins including urea derivatives are known CKO inhibitors but structural data explaining enzyme-inhibitor interactions are lacking. Thus, an inhibitory study with numerous urea derivatives was undertaken using the maize enzyme (ZmCKO1) and the crystal structure of ZmCKO1 in a complex with N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU) was solved. CPPU binds in a planar conformation and competes for the same binding site with natural substrates like N(6)-(2-isopentenyl)adenine (iP) and zeatin (Z). Nitrogens at the urea backbone are hydrogen bonded to the putative active site base Asp169. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis of L492 and E381 residues involved in the inhibitor binding was performed. The crystal structures of L492A mutant in a complex with CPPU and N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-benzylurea (CPBU) were solved and confirm the importance of a stacking interaction between the 2-chloro-4-pyridinyl ring of the inhibitor and the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor. Amino derivatives like N-(2-amino-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (APPU) inhibited ZmCKO1 more efficiently than CPPU, as opposed to the inhibition of E381A/S mutants, emphasizing the importance of this residue for inhibitor binding. As highly specific CKO inhibitors without undesired side effects are of major interest for physiological studies, all studied compounds were further analyzed for cytokinin activity in the Amaranthus bioassay and for binding to the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors AHK3 and AHK4. By contrast to CPPU itself, APPU and several benzylureas bind only negligibly to the receptors and exhibit weak cytokinin activity.</p>

<p>Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the first step in the heme degradation pathway. The crystal structures of apo- and heme-bound truncated human HO-2 reveal a primarily alpha-helical architecture similar to that of human HO-1 and other known HOs. Proper orientation of heme in HO-2 is required for the regioselective oxidation of the alpha-mesocarbon. This is accomplished by interactions within the heme binding pocket, which is made up of two helices. The iron coordinating residue, His(45), resides on the proximal helix. The distal helix contains highly conserved glycine residues that allow the helix to flex and interact with the bound heme. Tyr(154), Lys(199), and Arg(203) orient the heme through direct interactions with the heme propionates. The rearrangements of side chains in heme-bound HO-2 compared with apoHO-2 further elucidate HO-2 heme interactions.</p>

<p>Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, has been targeted by the Oxford Protein Production Facility to validate high-throughput protocols within the Structural Proteomics in Europe project. As part of this work, the structures of an alanine racemase (BA0252) in the presence and absence of the inhibitor (R)-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid (L-Ala-P) have determined by X-ray crystallography to resolutions of 2.1 and 1.47 A, respectively. Difficulties in crystallizing this protein were overcome by the use of reductive methylation. Alanine racemase has attracted much interest as a possible target for anti-anthrax drugs: not only is D-alanine a vital component of the bacterial cell wall, but recent studies also indicate that alanine racemase, which is accessible in the exosporium, plays a key role in inhibition of germination in B. anthracis. These structures confirm the binding mode of L-Ala-P but suggest an unexpected mechanism of inhibition of alanine racemase by this compound and could provide a basis for the design of improved alanine racemase inhibitors with potential as anti-anthrax therapies.</p>

<p>D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Alcaligenes faecalis catalyzes the reversible conversion between D-3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. The enzyme was crystallized in the presence of the substrate D-3-hydroxybutyrate and the cofactor NAD(+) at the optimum pH for the catalytic reaction. The structure, which was solved by X-ray crystallography, is isomorphous to that of the complex with the substrate analogue acetate. The product as well as the substrate molecule are accommodated well in the catalytic site. Their binding geometries suggest that the reversible reactions occur by shuttle movements of a hydrogen negative ion from the C3 atom of the substrate to the C4 atom of NAD(+) and from the C4 atom of NADH to the C3 atom of the product. The reaction might be further coupled to the withdrawal of a proton from the hydroxyl group of the substrate by the ionized Tyr155 residue. These structural features strongly support the previously proposed reaction mechanism of D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which was based on the acetate-bound complex structure.</p>

<p>We describe the discovery of novel inhibitors of prostaglandin D2 synthase (PGDS) through fragment-based lead generation and structure-based drug design. A library of 2500 low-molecular-weight compounds was screened using 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), leading to the identification of 24 primary hits. Structure determination of protein-ligand complexes with the hits enabled a hit optimization process, whereby we harvested increasingly more potent inhibitors out of our corporate compound collection. Two iterative cycles were carried out, comprising NMR screening, molecular modeling, X-ray crystallography, and in vitro biochemical testing. Six novel high-resolution PGDS complex structures were determined, and 300 hit analogues were tested. This rational drug design procedure culminated in the discovery of 24 compounds with an IC 50 below 1 microM in the in vitro assay. The best inhibitor (IC 50 = 21 nM) is one of the most potent inhibitors of PGDS to date. As such, it may enable new functional in vivo studies of PGDS and the prostaglandin metabolism pathway.</p>

<p>Substrate initially binds to β-galactosidase (Escherichia coli) at a 'shallow' site. It then moves ∼3Å to a 'deep' site and the transition state forms. Asn460 interacts in both sites, forming a water bridge interaction with the O3 hydroxyl of the galactosyl moiety in the shallow site and a direct H-bond with the O2 hydroxyl of the transition state in the deep site. Structural and kinetic studies were done with β-galactosidases with substitutions for Asn460. The substituted enzymes have enhanced substrate affinity in the shallow site indicating lower E·substrate complex energy levels. They have poor transition state stabilization in the deep site that is manifested by increased energy levels of the E·transition state complexes. These changes in stability result in increased activation energies and lower k(cat) values. Substrate affinity to N460D-β-galactosidase was enhanced through greater binding enthalpy (stronger H-bonds through the bridging water) while better affinity to N460T-β-galactosidase occurred because of greater binding entropy. The transition states are less stable with N460S- and N460T-β-galactosidase because of the weakening or loss of the important bond to the O2 hydroxyl of the transition state. For N460D-β-galactosidase, the transition state is less stable due to an increased entropy penalty.</p>

<p>Two crystal structures of recombinant Geobacillus stearothermophilus 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gs6PDH) in complex with the substrate 6-phosphogluconate have been determined at medium resolution. Gs6PDH shares significant sequence identity and structural similarity with the enzymes from Lactococcus lactis, sheep liver and the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, for which a range of structures have previously been reported. Comparisons indicate that amino-acid sequence conservation is more pronounced in the two domains that contribute to the architecture of the active site, namely the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, compared with the central domain, which is primarily involved in the subunit-subunit associations required to form a stable dimer. The active-site residues are highly conserved, as are the interactions with the 6-phosphogluconate. There is interest in 6PDH as a potential drug target for the protozoan parasite T. brucei, the pathogen responsible for African sleeping sickness. The recombinant T. brucei enzyme has proven to be recalcitrant to enzyme-ligand studies and a surrogate protein might offer new opportunities to investigate and characterize 6PDH inhibitors. The high degree of structural similarity, efficient level of expression and straightforward crystallization conditions mean that Gs6PDH may prove to be an appropriate model system for structure-based inhibitor design targeting the enzyme from Trypanosoma species.</p>

<p>The photosensitizer, methylene blue (MB), generates singlet oxygen that irreversibly inhibits Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE). In the dark, it inhibits reversibly. Binding is accompanied by a bathochromic absorption shift, used to demonstrate displacement by other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors interacting with the catalytic "anionic" subsite (CAS), the peripheral "anionic" subsite (PAS), or bridging them. MB is a noncompetitive inhibitor of TcAChE, competing with reversible inhibitors directed at both "anionic" subsites, but a single site is involved in inhibition. MB also quenches TcAChE's intrinsic fluorescence. It binds to TcAChE covalently inhibited by a small organophosphate (OP), but not an OP containing a bulky pyrene. Differential scanning calorimetry shows an ~8° increase in the denaturation temperature of the MB/TcAChE complex relative to native TcAChE, and a less than twofold increase in cooperativity of the transition. The crystal structure reveals a single MB stacked against Trp279 in the PAS, oriented down the gorge toward the CAS; it is plausible that irreversible inhibition is associated with photooxidation of this residue and others within the active-site gorge. The kinetic and spectroscopic data showing that inhibitors binding at the CAS can impede binding of MB are reconciled by docking studies showing that the conformation adopted by Phe330, midway down the gorge, in the MB/TcAChE crystal structure, precludes simultaneous binding of a second MB at the CAS. Conversely, binding of ligands at the CAS dislodges MB from its preferred locus at the PAS. The data presented demonstrate that TcAChE is a valuable model for understanding the molecular basis of local photooxidative damage.</p>

<p>Previous work has shown that Y-family DNA polymerases tolerate large DNA adducts, but a substantial decrease in catalytic efficiency and fidelity occurs during bypass of N2,N2-dimethyl (Me2)-substituted guanine (N2,N2-Me2G), in contrast to a single methyl substitution. Therefore, it is unclear why the addition of two methyl groups is so disruptive. The presence of N2,N2-Me2G lowered the catalytic efficiency of the model enzyme Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 16,000-fold. Dpo4 inserted dNTPs almost at random during bypass of N2,N2-Me2G, and much of the enzyme was kinetically trapped by an inactive ternary complex when N2,N2-Me2G was present, as judged by a reduced burst amplitude (5% of total enzyme) and kinetic modeling. One crystal structure of Dpo4 with a primer having a 3'-terminal dideoxycytosine (Cdd) opposite template N2,N2-Me2G in a post-insertion position showed Cdd folded back into the minor groove, as a catalytically incompetent complex. A second crystal had two unique orientations for the primer terminal Cdd as follows: (i) flipped into the minor groove and (ii) a long pairing with N2,N2-Me2G in which one hydrogen bond exists between the O-2 atom of Cdd and the N-1 atom of N2,N2-Me2G, with a second water-mediated hydrogen bond between the N-3 atom of Cdd and the O-6 atom of N2,N2-Me2G. A crystal structure of Dpo4 with dTTP opposite template N2,N2-Me2G revealed a wobble orientation. Collectively, these results explain, in a detailed manner, the basis for the reduced efficiency and fidelity of Dpo4-catalyzed bypass of N2,N2-Me2G compared with mono-substituted N2-alkyl G adducts.</p>

<p>The structural mechanism of the catalytic functioning of shikimate kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated on the basis of a series of high-resolution crystal structures corresponding to individual steps in the enzymatic reaction. The catalytic turnover of shikimate and ATP into the products shikimate-3-phosphate and ADP, followed by release of ADP, was studied in the crystalline environment. Based on a comparison of the structural states before initiation of the reaction and immediately after the catalytic step, we derived a structural model of the transition state that suggests that phosphoryl transfer proceeds with inversion by an in-line associative mechanism. The random sequential binding of shikimate and nucleotides is associated with domain movements. We identified a synergic mechanism by which binding of the first substrate may enhance the affinity for the second substrate.</p>

<p>The structural mechanism of the catalytic functioning of shikimate kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated on the basis of a series of high-resolution crystal structures corresponding to individual steps in the enzymatic reaction. The catalytic turnover of shikimate and ATP into the products shikimate-3-phosphate and ADP, followed by release of ADP, was studied in the crystalline environment. Based on a comparison of the structural states before initiation of the reaction and immediately after the catalytic step, we derived a structural model of the transition state that suggests that phosphoryl transfer proceeds with inversion by an in-line associative mechanism. The random sequential binding of shikimate and nucleotides is associated with domain movements. We identified a synergic mechanism by which binding of the first substrate may enhance the affinity for the second substrate.</p>

<p>CA inhibitors: Human carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Various carborane cages are shown to act as active-site-directed inhibitors, and substitution with a sulfamide group and other substituents leads to compounds with high selectivity towards the cancer-specific isozyme IX. Crystal structures of the carboranes in the active site provide information that can be applied to the structure-based design of specific inhibitors. </p>

<p>The potent new antiviral inhibitor GRL-98065 (1) of HIV-1 protease (PR) has been studied with PR variants containing the single mutations D30N, I50V, V82A, and I84V that provide resistance to the major clinical inhibitors. Compound 1 had inhibition constants of 17-fold, 8-fold, 3-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, for PR(D30N), PR(I50V), PR(V82A), and PR(I84V) relative to wild type PR. The chemically related darunavir had similar relative inhibition, except for PR(D30N), where inhibitor 1 was approximately 3-fold less potent. The high resolution (1.11-1.60 Angstrom) crystal structures of PR mutant complexes with inhibitor 1 showed small changes relative to the wild type enzyme. PR(D30N) and PR(V82A) showed compensating interactions with inhibitor 1 relative to those of PR, while reduced hydrophobic contacts were observed with PR(I50V) and PR(I84V). Importantly, inhibitor 1 complexes showed fewer changes relative to wild type enzyme than reported for darunavir complexes. Therefore, inhibitor 1 is a valuable addition to the antiviral inhibitors with high potency against resistant strains of HIV.</p>

<p>Ferrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase, EC 4.99.1.1) is the terminal enzyme in heme biosynthesis and catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX to form protoheme IX (heme). Due to the many critical roles of heme, synthesis of heme is required by the vast majority of organisms. Despite significant investigation of both the microbial and eukaryotic enzyme, details of metal chelation remain unidentified. Here we present the first structure of the wild-type human enzyme, a lead-inhibited intermediate of the wild-type enzyme with bound metallated porphyrin macrocycle, the product bound form of the enzyme, and a higher resolution model for the substrate-bound form of the E343K variant. These data paint a picture of an enzyme that undergoes significant changes in secondary structure during the catalytic cycle. The role that these structural alterations play in overall catalysis and potential protein-protein interactions with other proteins, as well as the possible molecular basis for these changes, is discussed. The atomic details and structural rearrangements presented herein significantly advance our understanding of the substrate binding mode of ferrochelatase and reveal new conformational changes in a structurally conserved pi-helix that is predicted to have a central role in product release.</p>

<p>The crystal structures of Leishmania mexicana fructose-1,6-bis(phosphate) aldolase in complex with substrate and competitive inhibitor, mannitol-1,6-bis(phosphate), were solved to 2.2 A resolution. Crystallographic analysis revealed a Schiff base intermediate trapped in the native structure complexed with substrate while the inhibitor was trapped in a conformation mimicking the carbinolamine intermediate. Binding modes corroborated previous structures reported for rabbit muscle aldolase. Amino acid substitution of Gly-312 to Ala, adjacent to the P1-phosphate binding site and unique to trypanosomatids, did not perturb ligand binding in the active site. Ligand attachment ordered amino acid residues 359-367 of the C-terminal region (353-373) that was disordered beyond Asp-358 in the unbound structure, revealing a novel recruitment mechanism of this region by aldolases. C-Terminal peptide ordering is triggered by P1-phosphate binding that induces conformational changes whereby C-terminal Leu-364 contacts P1-phosphate binding residue Arg-313. C-Terminal region capture synergizes additional interactions with subunit surface residues, not perturbed by P1-phosphate binding, and stabilizes C-terminal attachment. Amino acid residues that participate in the capturing interaction are conserved among class I aldolases, indicating a general recruitment mechanism whereby C-terminal capture facilitates active site interactions in subsequent catalytic steps. Recruitment accelerates the enzymatic reaction by using binding energy to reduce configurational entropy during catalysis thereby localizing the conserved C-terminus tyrosine, which mediates proton transfer, proximal to the active site enamine.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Fe-type nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus erythropolis AJ270 was determined at 1.3A resolution. The two cysteine residues (alphaCys(112) and alphaCys(114)) equatorially coordinated to the ferric ion were post-translationally modified to cysteine sulfinic acids. A glutamine residue (alphaGln(90)) in the active center gave double conformations. Based on the interactions among the enzyme, substrate and water molecules, a new mechanism of biocatalysis of nitrile hydratase was proposed, in which the water molecule activated by the glutamine residue performed as the nucleophile to attack on the nitrile which was simultaneously interacted by another water molecule coordinated to the ferric ion.</p>

<p>ATP:Corrinoid adenosyltransferases (ACAs) catalyze the transfer of the adenosyl moiety from ATP to cob(I)alamin via a four-coordinate cob(II)alamin intermediate. At present, it is unknown how ACAs promote the formation of the four-coordinate corrinoid species needed for activity. The published high-resolution crystal structure of the ACA from Lactobacillus reuteri (LrPduO) in complex with ATP and cob(II)alamin shows that the environment around the alpha face of the corrin ring consists of bulky hydrophobic residues. To understand how these residues promote the generation of the four-coordinate cob(II)alamin, variants of the human-type ACA enzyme from L. reuteri (LrPduO) were kinetically and structurally characterized. These studies revealed that residue Phe112 is critical in the displacement of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) from its coordination bond with the Co ion of the ring, resulting in the formation of the four-coordinate species. An F112A substitution resulted in a 80% drop in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The explanation for this loss of activity was obtained from the crystal structure of the mutant protein, which showed cob(II)alamin bound in the active site with DMB coordinated to the cobalt ion. The crystal structure of an LrPduO(F112H) variant showed a DMB-off/His-on interaction between the corrinoid and the enzyme, whose catalytic efficiency was 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of the wild-type protein. The analysis of the kinetic parameters of LrPduO(F112H) suggests that the F112H substitution negatively impacts product release. Substitutions of other hydrophobic residues in the Cbl binding pocket did not result in significant defects in catalytic efficiency in vitro; however, none of the variant enzymes analyzed in this work supported AdoCbl biosynthesis in vivo.</p>

<p>Bioenergy is efficiently produced in the mitochondria by the respiratory system consisting of complexes I-V. In various organisms, complex I can be replaced by the alternative NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-2), which catalyzes the transfer of an electron from NADH via FAD to quinone, without proton pumping. The Ndi1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a monotopic membrane protein, directed to the matrix. A number of studies have investigated the potential use of Ndi1 as a therapeutic agent against complex I disorders, and the NDH-2 enzymes have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for treatments against the causative agents of malaria and tuberculosis. Here we present the crystal structures of Ndi1 in its substrate-free, NAD(+)- and ubiquinone- (UQ2) complexed states. The structures reveal that Ndi1 is a peripheral membrane protein forming an intimate dimer, in which packing of the monomeric units within the dimer creates an amphiphilic membrane-anchor domain structure. Crucially, the structures of the Ndi1-NAD(+) and Ndi1-UQ2 complexes show overlapping binding sites for the NAD(+) and quinone substrates.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of a pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (PSCP) has been solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction using the absorption peak of bromide anions. Structures of the uninhibited enzyme and of complexes with an inhibitor that was either covalently or noncovalently bound were refined at 1.0-1.4 A resolution. The structure of PSCP comprises a single compact domain with a diameter of approximately 55 A, consisting of a seven-stranded parallel beta-sheet flanked on both sides by a number of helices. The fold of PSCP is a superset of the subtilisin fold, and the covalently bound inhibitor is linked to the enzyme through a serine residue. Thus, the structure of PSCP defines a novel family of serine-carboxyl proteinases (defined as MEROPS S53) with a unique catalytic triad consisting of Glu 80, Asp 84 and Ser 287.</p>

<p>1-Deoxy-<i>D</i>-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) in the non-mevalonate isoprene biosynthesis pathway is a target for developing antimalarial drugs. Fosmidomycin, a potent DXR inhibitor, showed safety as well as efficacy against <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria in clinical trials. Based on our previous quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and crystallographic studies, several novel pyridine-containing fosmidomycin derivatives were designed, synthesized and found to be highly potent inhibitors of <i>P. falciparum</i> DXR (<i>Pf</i>DXR) having K<sub>i</sub> values of 1.9 - 13 nM, with the best one being ~11× more active than fosmidomycin. These compounds also potently block the proliferation of multi-drug resistant <i>P. falciparum</i> with EC<sub>50</sub> values as low as 170 nM. A 2.3 Å crystal structure of <i>Pf</i>DXR in complex with one of the inhibitors is reported, showing the flexible loop of the protein undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding and a hydrogen bond and favorable hydrophobic interactions between the pyridine group and <i>Pf</i>DXR account for the enhanced activity.</p>

<p>Asparagine-linked glycosylation is a common posttranslational modification of diverse secretory and membrane proteins in eukaryotes, where it is catalyzed by the multiprotein complex oligosaccharyltransferase. The functions of the protein subunits of oligoasccharyltransferase, apart from the catalytic Stt3p, are ill defined. Here we describe functional and structural investigations of the Ost3/6p components of the yeast enzyme. Genetic, biochemical and structural analyses of the lumenal domain of Ost6p revealed oxidoreductase activity mediated by a thioredoxin-like fold with a distinctive active-site loop that changed conformation with redox state. We found that mutation of the active-site cysteine residues of Ost6p and its paralogue Ost3p affected the glycosylation efficiency of a subset of glycosylation sites. Our results show that eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase is a multifunctional enzyme that acts at the crossroads of protein modification and protein folding.</p>

<p>Native data, anomalous data at three wavelengths and an independent peak-wavelength data set for SeMet-substituted protein have been collected from cryoprotected crystals of the TrpRS-adenylate product (TAM) complex to a resolution limit of 1.7 A. Independent phase sets were developed using SHARP and improved by solvent flipping with SOLOMON using molecular envelopes derived from experimental densities for, respectively, peak-wavelength SAD data from four different crystals, MAD data and their M(S)IRAS combinations with native data. Hendrickson-Lattman phase-probability coefficients from each phase set were used in BUSTER to drive maximum-likelihood refinements of well defined parts of the previously refined room-temperature 2.9 A structure. Maximum-entropy completion followed by manual rebuilding was then used to generate a model for the missing segments, bound ligand and solvent molecules. Surprisingly, peak-wavelength SAD experiments produced the smallest phase errors relative to the refined structures. Selenomethionylated models deviate from one another by 0.25 A and from the native model by 0.38 A, but all have r.m.s. deviations of approximately 1.0 A from the 2.9 A model. Difference Fourier calculations between amplitudes from the 300 K experiment and the new amplitudes at 100 K using 1.7 A model phases show no significant structural changes arising from temperature variation or addition of cryoprotectant. The main differences between low- and high-resolution structures arise from correcting side-chain rotamers in the core of the protein as well as on the surface. These changes improve various structure-validation criteria.</p>

<p>The structure-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of nonpeptidic macrocyclic HIV protease inhibitors are described. The inhibitors are designed to effectively fill in the hydrophobic pocket in the S1'-S2' subsites and retain all major hydrogen bonding interactions with the protein backbone similar to darunavir (1) or inhibitor 2. The ring size, the effect of methyl substitution, and unsaturation within the macrocyclic ring structure were assessed. In general, cyclic inhibitors were significantly more potent than their acyclic homologues, saturated rings were less active than their unsaturated analogues and a preference for 10- and 13-membered macrocylic rings was revealed. The addition of methyl substituents resulted in a reduction of potency. Both inhibitors 14b and 14c exhibited marked enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activity, and they exerted potent activity against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants. Protein-ligand X-ray structures of inhibitors 2 and 14c provided critical molecular insights into the ligand-binding site interactions.</p>

<p>Two structures of Escherichia coli soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase (EPPase) complexed with calcium pyrophosphate (CaPP(i)-EPPase) and with Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)-EPPase) have been solved at 1.2 and 1.1 A resolution, respectively. In the presence of Mg(2+), this enzyme cleaves pyrophosphate (PP(i)) into two molecules of orthophosphate (P(i)). This work has enabled us to locate PP(i) in the active site of the inorganic pyrophosphatases family in the presence of Ca(2+), which is an inhibitor of EPPase.Upon PP(i) binding, two Ca(2+) at M1 and M2 subsites move closer together and one of the liganded water molecules becomes bridging. The mutual location of PP(i) and the bridging water molecule in the presence of inhibitor cation is catalytically incompetent. To make a favourable PP(i) attack by this water molecule, modelling of a possible hydrolysable conformation of PP(i) in the CaPP(i)-EPPase active site has been performed. The reasons for Ca(2+) being the strong PPase inhibitor and the role in catalysis of each of four metal ions are the mechanistic aspects discussed on the basis of the structures described.</p>

<p>The uncharacterized α/β-hydrolase protein OLEI01171 from the psychrophilic marine bacterium Oleispira antarctica belongs to the PF00756 family of putative esterases, which also includes human esterase D. In the present paper we show that purified recombinant OLEI01171 exhibits high esterase activity against the model esterase substrate α-naphthyl acetate at 5-30°C with maximal activity at 15-20°C. The esterase activity of OLEI01171 was stimulated 3-8-fold by the addition of chloride or several other anions (0.1-1.0 M). Compared with mesophilic PF00756 esterases, OLEI01171 exhibited a lower overall protein thermostability. Two crystal structures of OLEI01171 were solved at 1.75 and 2.1 Å resolution and revealed a classical serine hydrolase catalytic triad and the presence of a chloride or bromide ion bound in the active site close to the catalytic Ser148. Both anions were found to co-ordinate a potential catalytic water molecule located in the vicinity of the catalytic triad His257. The results of the present study suggest that the bound anion perhaps contributes to the polarization of the catalytic water molecule and increases the rate of the hydrolysis of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Alanine replacement mutagenesis of OLEI01171 identified ten amino acid residues important for esterase activity. The replacement of Asn225 by lysine had no significant effect on the activity or thermostability of OLEI01171, but resulted in a detectable increase of activity at 35-45°C. The present study has provided insight into the molecular mechanisms of activity of a cold-active and anion-activated carboxyl esterase.</p>

<p>Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 2R,3S,4S-flavan-3,4-diols into 2R,3S-flavan-3-ols, a subfamily of flavonoids that is important for plant survival and for human nutrition. LAR1 from Vitis vinifera has been co-crystallized with or without NADPH and one of its natural products, (+)-catechin. Crystals diffract to a resolution between 1.75 and 2.72 A. The coenzyme and substrate binding pocket is preformed in the apoprotein and not markedly altered upon NADPH binding. The structure of the abortive ternary complex, determined at a resolution of 2.28 A, indicates the ordering of a short 3(10) helix associated with substrate binding and suggests that His122 and Lys140 act as acid-base catalysts. Based on our 3D structures, a two-step catalytic mechanism is proposed, in which a concerted dehydration precedes an NADPH-mediated hydride transfer at C4. The dehydration step involves a Lys-catalyzed deprotonation of the phenolic OH7 through a bridging water molecule and a His-catalyzed protonation of the benzylic hydroxyl at C4. The resulting quinone methide serves as an electrophilic target for hydride transfer at C4. LAR belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily and to the PIP (pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase, isoflavone reductase, and phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase) family. Our data support the concept that all PIP enzymes reduce a quinone methide intermediate and that the major role of the only residue that has been conserved from the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase catalytic triad (Ser...TyrXXXLys), that is, lysine, is to promote the formation of this intermediate by catalyzing the deprotonation of a phenolic hydroxyl. For some PIP enzymes, this lysine-catalyzed proton abstraction may be sufficient to trigger the extrusion of the leaving group, whereas in LAR, the extrusion of a hydroxide group requires a more sophisticated mechanism of concerted acid-base catalysis that involves histidine and takes advantage of the OH4, OH5, and OH7 substituents of leucoanthocyanidins.</p>

<p>In this study, we take advantage of the ability of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) from Pseudomonas mevalonii to remain active while in its crystallized form to study the changing interactions between the ligands and protein as the first reaction intermediate is created. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes one of the few double oxidation-reduction reactions in intermediary metabolism that take place in a single active site. Our laboratory has undertaken an exploration of this reaction space using structures of HMG-CoA reductase complexed with various substrate, nucleotide, product, and inhibitor combinations. With a focus in this publication on the first hydride transfer, our structures follow this reduction reaction as the enzyme converts the HMG-CoA thioester from a flat sp(2)-like geometry to a pyramidal thiohemiacetal configuration consistent with a transition to an sp(3) orbital. This change in the geometry propagates through the coenzyme A (CoA) ligand whose first amide bond is rotated 180° where it anchors a web of hydrogen bonds that weave together the nucleotide, the reaction intermediate, the enzyme, and the catalytic residues. This creates a stable intermediate structure prepared for nucleotide exchange and the second reduction reaction within the HMG-CoA reductase active site. Identification of this reaction intermediate provides a template for the development of an inhibitor that would act as an antibiotic effective against the HMG-CoA reductase of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. </p>

<p>The universal genetic code relies on two hydrogen-bonded Watson-Crick base pairs that can form 64 triplet codons. This places a limit on the number of amino acids that can be encoded, which has motivated efforts to create synthetic base pairs that are orthogonal to the natural ones. An additional base pair would result in another 61 triplet codons. Artificial organic base pairs have been described in enzymatic incorporation studies, and inorganic T-Hg-T and C-Ag-C base pairs have been reported to form in primer extension studies. Here, we demonstrate a metal base pair that is fully orthogonal and can be replicated, and can even be amplified by polymerase chain reaction in the presence of the canonical pairs dA:dT and dG:dC. Crystal structures of a dS-Cu-dS base pair inside a polymerase show that reversible chemistry is possible directly inside the polymerase, which enables the efficient copying of the inorganic crosslink. The results open up the possibility of replicating and amplifying artificial inorganic DNA nanostructures by extending the genetic alphabet.</p>

<p>Cellular and viral S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases are involved in many regulated processes such as metabolism, detoxification, signal transduction, chromatin remodeling, nucleic acid processing, and mRNA capping. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus nsp16 protein is a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent (nucleoside-2'-O)-methyltransferase only active in the presence of its activating partner nsp10. We report the nsp10/nsp16 complex structure at 2.0 Å resolution, which shows nsp10 bound to nsp16 through a ∼930 Å² surface area in nsp10. Functional assays identify key residues involved in nsp10/nsp16 association, and in RNA binding or catalysis, the latter likely through a SN2-like mechanism. We present two other crystal structures, the inhibitor Sinefungin bound in the S-adenosylmethionine binding pocket and the tighter complex nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16, providing the first structural insight into the regulation of RNA capping enzymes in +RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Human ACE (angiotensin-I-converting enzyme) has long been regarded as an excellent target for the treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. Highly potent inhibitors have been developed and are extensively used in the clinic. To develop inhibitors with higher therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects, recent efforts have been directed towards the discovery of compounds able to simultaneously block more than one zinc metallopeptidase (apart from ACE) involved in blood pressure regulation in humans, such as neprilysin and ECE-1 (endothelin-converting enzyme-1). In the present paper, we show the first structures of testis ACE [C-ACE, which is identical with the C-domain of somatic ACE and the dominant domain responsible for blood pressure regulation, at 1.97Å (1 Å=0.1 nm)] and the N-domain of somatic ACE (N-ACE, at 2.15Å) in complex with a highly potent and selective dual ACE/ECE-1 inhibitor. The structural determinants revealed unique features of the binding of two molecules of the dual inhibitor in the active site of C-ACE. In both structures, the first molecule is positioned in the obligatory binding site and has a bulky bicyclic P(1)' residue with the unusual R configuration which, surprisingly, is accommodated by the large S(2)' pocket. In the C-ACE complex, the isoxazole phenyl group of the second molecule makes strong pi-pi stacking interactions with the amino benzoyl group of the first molecule locking them in a 'hand-shake' conformation. These features, for the first time, highlight the unusual architecture and flexibility of the active site of C-ACE, which could be further utilized for structure-based design of new C-ACE or vasopeptidase inhibitors.</p>

Crystal structures of a dS-Cu-dS base pair inside a polymerase show that reversible chemistry is possible directly inside the polymerase, which enables the efficient copying of the inorganic crosslink. The results open up the possibility of replicating and amplifying artificial inorganic DNA nanostructures by extending the genetic alphabet.</p>

<p>Cellular and viral S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases are involved in many regulated processes such as metabolism, detoxification, signal transduction, chromatin remodeling, nucleic acid processing, and mRNA capping. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus nsp16 protein is a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent (nucleoside-2'-O)-methyltransferase only active in the presence of its activating partner nsp10. We report the nsp10/nsp16 complex structure at 2.0 Å resolution, which shows nsp10 bound to nsp16 through a ∼930 Å² surface area in nsp10. Functional assays identify key residues involved in nsp10/nsp16 association, and in RNA binding or catalysis, the latter likely through a SN2-like mechanism. We present two other crystal structures, the inhibitor Sinefungin bound in the S-adenosylmethionine binding pocket and the tighter complex nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16, providing the first structural insight into the regulation of RNA capping enzymes in +RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Sialic acids are activated by CMP-5-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase prior to their transfer onto oligo- or polysaccharides. Here, we present the crystal structure of the N-terminal catalytically active domain of the murine 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase in complex with the reaction product. In contrast to the previously solved structure of 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase from Neisseria meningitidis and the related CMP-KDO-synthetase of Escherichia coli, the murine enzyme is a tetramer, which was observed with the active sites closed. In this conformation a loop is shifted by 6A towards the active site and thus an essential arginine residue can participate in catalysis. Furthermore, a network of intermolecular salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds in the dimer as well as hydrophobic interfaces between two dimers indicate a cooperative behaviour of the enzyme. In addition, a complex regulation of the enzyme activity is proposed that includes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.</p>

<p>Many large natural product antibiotics act by specifically binding and sequestering target molecules found on bacterial cells. We have developed a new strategy to expedite the structural analysis of such antibiotic-target complexes, in which we covalently link the target molecules to carrier proteins, and then crystallize the entire carrier-target-antibiotic complex. Using native chemical ligation, we have linked the Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala binding epitope for glycopeptide antibiotics to three different carrier proteins. We show that recognition of this peptide by multiple antibiotics is not compromised by the presence of the carrier protein partner, and use this approach to determine the first-ever crystal structure for the new therapeutic dalbavancin. We also report the first crystal structure of an asymmetric ristocetin antibiotic dimer, as well as the structure of vancomycin bound to a carrier-target fusion. The dalbavancin structure reveals an antibiotic molecule that has closed around its binding partner; it also suggests mechanisms by which the drug can enhance its half-life by binding to serum proteins, and be targeted to bacterial membranes. Notably, the carrier protein approach is not limited to peptide ligands such as Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, but is applicable to a diverse range of targets. This strategy is likely to yield structural insights that accelerate new therapeutic development.</p>

<p>Using fragment-based screening of a focused fragment library, 2-aminoquinoline 1 was identified as an initial hit for BACE1. Further SAR development was supported by X-ray structures of BACE1 cocrystallized with various ligands and molecular modeling studies to expedite the discovery of potent compounds. These strategies enabled us to integrate the C-3 side chain on 2-aminoquinoline 1 extending deep into the P2' binding pocket of BACE1 and enhancing the ligand's potency. We were able to improve the BACE1 potency to subnanomolar range, over 10(6)-fold more potent than the initial hit (900 μM). Further elaboration of the physical properties of the lead compounds to those more consistent with good blood-brain barrier permeability led to inhibitors with greatly improved cellular activity and permeability. Compound 59 showed an IC(50) value of 11 nM on BACE1 and cellular activity of 80 nM. This compound was advanced into rat pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and demonstrated significant reduction of Aβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p>

<p>Upregulation of CAD, the multifunctional protein that initiates and controls the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines in animals, is essential for cell proliferation. Deciphering the architecture and functioning of CAD is of interest for its potential usage as an antitumoral target. However, there is no detailed structural information about CAD other than that it self-assembles into hexamers of ∼1.5 MDa. Here we report the crystal structure and functional characterization of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD. Contradicting all assumptions, the structure reveals an active site enclosed by a flexible loop with two Zn²⁺ ions bridged by a carboxylated lysine and a third Zn coordinating a rare histidinate ion. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays prove the involvement of the Zn and flexible loop in catalysis. Comparison with homologous bacterial enzymes supports a reclassification of the DHOase family and provides strong evidence against current models of the architecture of CAD.</p>

<p>In yeast, the mRNA processing enzyme poly(A) polymerase is tethered to the much larger 3'-end processing complex via Fip1, a 36 kDa protein of unknown structure. We report the 2.6 A crystal structure of yeast poly(A) polymerase in complex with a peptide containing residues 80-105 of Fip1. The Fip1 peptide binds to the outside surface of the C-terminal domain of the polymerase. On the basis of this structure, we designed a mutant of the polymerase (V498Y, C485R) that is lethal to yeast. The mutant is unable to bind Fip1 but retains full polymerase activity. Fip1 is found in all eukaryotes and serves to connect poly(A) polymerase to pre-mRNA processing complexes in yeast, plants, and mammals. However, the Fip1 sequence is highly divergent, and residues on both Pap1 and Fip1 at the observed interaction surface are poorly conserved. Herein we demonstrate using analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, proteolytic studies, and other techniques that, in the absence of Pap1, Fip1 is largely, if not completely, unfolded. We speculate that flexibility may be important for Fip1's function as a molecular scaffold.</p>

<p>The survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis depends on mycolic acids, very long α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids comprising 60-90 carbon atoms. However, despite considerable efforts, little is known about how enzymes involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis recognize and bind their hydrophobic fatty acyl substrates. The condensing enzyme KasA is pivotal for the synthesis of very long (C38-42) fatty acids, the precursors of mycolic acids. To probe the mechanism of substrate and inhibitor recognition by KasA, we determined the structure of this protein in complex with a mycobacterial phospholipid and with several thiolactomycin derivatives that were designed as substrate analogs. Our structures provide consecutive snapshots along the reaction coordinate for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction and support an induced fit mechanism in which a wide cavity is established through the concerted opening of three gatekeeping residues and several α-helices. The stepwise characterization of the binding process provides mechanistic insights into the induced fit recognition in this system and serves as an excellent foundation for the development of high affinity KasA inhibitors. </p>

<p>A novel series of 5-aminopyrimidinyl quinazolines has been developed from anilino-quinazoline 1, which was identified in a high throughput screen for Aurora A. Introduction of the pyrimidine ring and optimisation of the substituents both on this ring and at the C7 position of the quinazoline led to the discovery of compounds that are highly specific Aurora kinase inhibitors. Co-crystallisation of one of these inhibitors with a fragment of Aurora A shows the importance of the benzamido group in achieving selectivity.</p>

<p>Cathepsin A (CatA) is a serine carboxypeptidase distributed between lysosomes, cell membrane, and extracellular space. Several peptide hormones including bradykinin and angiotensin I have been described as substrates. Therefore, the inhibition of CatA has the potential for beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of CatA by the natural product ebelactone B increased renal bradykinin levels and prevented the development of salt-induced hypertension. However, so far no small molecule inhibitors of CatA with oral bioavailability have been described to allow further pharmacological profiling. In our work we identified novel β-amino acid derivatives as inhibitors of CatA after a HTS analysis based on a project adapted fragment approach. The new inhibitors showed beneficial ADME and pharmacokinetic profiles, and their binding modes were established by X-ray crystallography. Further investigations led to the identification of a hitherto unknown pathophysiological role of CatA in cardiac hypertrophy. One of our inhibitors is currently undergoing phase I clinical trials.</p>

<p>Streptococcus pneumoniae produces a cell-surface attached β-N-acetylglucosaminidase called StrH that is used by this pathogen to process the termini of host complex N-linked glycans. N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine-thiazoline (NAG-Thiazoline, NGT) and O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino N-phenyl carbamate (PUGNAc) are inhibitors of the two family 20 glycoside hydrolase catalytic modules within StrH and these inhibitors have proven useful in modulating the activity of StrH in assays that model aspects of the host-bacterium interaction. Here we explore the molecular basis of StrH inhibition through structural, kinetic, thermodynamic and site-directed mutagenic analyses using the recombinantly produced independent catalytic modules of StrH (GH20A and GH20B) and the inhibitors NGT and PUGNAc. The results reveal a similar binding mode of the sugar moiety of these inhibitors at the -1 subsite in the active sites of GH20A and GH20B. The lower affinity of NGT as compared to PUGNAc for these catalytic modules can be attributed to the hydrophobic phenylcarbamate moiety of PUGNAc that is absent in NGT. This moiety also displayed variations in its interactions with the active sites of GH20A and GH20B that provide a rationale for the 400-fold difference observed in the Ki values of this compound for these two β-N-acetylglucosaminidase catalytic modules.</p>

<p>The hyperthermophilic endoglucanase Cel5A from Thermotoga maritima can find applications in lignocellulosic biofuel production, because it catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucan- and mannan-based polysaccharides. Here, we report the crystal structures in apo-form and in complex with three ligands, cellotetraose, cellobiose and mannotriose, at 1.29Å to 2.40Å resolution. The open carbohydrate-binding cavity which can accommodate oligosaccharide substrates with extensively branched chains explained the dual specificity of the enzyme. Combining our structural information and the previous kinetic data, it is suggested that this enzyme prefers β-glucosyl and β-mannosyl moieties at the reducing end and uses two conserved catalytic residues, E253 (nucleophile) and E136 (general acid/base), to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds. Moreover, our results also suggest that the wide spectrum of Tm_Cel5A substrates might be due to the lack of steric hindrance around the C2-hydroxyl group of the glucose or mannose unit from active-site residues.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of gluconate kinase from Escherichia coli has been determined to 2.0 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The three-dimensional structure was solved by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion, using a crystal of selenomethionine-substituted enzyme. Gluconate kinase is an alpha/beta structure consisting of a twisted parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices with overall topology similar to nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases, such as adenylate kinase. In order to identify residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis, structures of binary complexes with ATP, the ATP analogue adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene) triphosphate and the product, gluconate-6-phosphate have been determined. Significant conformational changes are induced upon binding of ATP to the enzyme. The largest changes involve a hinge-bending motion of the NMP(bind) part and a motion of the LID with adjacent helices, which opens the cavity to the second substrate, gluconate. Opening of the active site cleft upon ATP binding is the opposite of what has been observed in the NMP kinase family so far, which usually close their active site to prevent fortuitous hydrolysis of ATP. The conformational change positions the side-chain of Arg120 to stack with the purine ring of ATP and the side-chain of Arg124 is shifted to interact with the alpha-phosphate in ATP, at the same time protecting ATP from solvent water. The beta and gamma-phosphate groups of ATP bind in the predicted P-loop. A conserved lysine side-chain interacts with the gamma-phosphate group, and might promote phosphoryl transfer. Gluconate-6-phosphate binds with its phosphate group in a similar position as the gamma-phosphate of ATP, consistent with inline phosphoryl transfer. The gluconate binding-pocket in GntK is located in a different position than the nucleoside binding-site usually found in NMP kinases.</p>

<p>D-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase (DTD) is an editing enzyme that removes D-amino acids from mischarged tRNAs. We describe an in-depth analysis of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum DTD here. Our data provide structural insights into DTD complexes with adenosine and D-amino acids. Bound adenosine is proximal to the DTD catalysis site, and it represents the authentic terminal adenosine of charged tRNA. DTD-bound D-amino acids cluster at three different subsites within the overall active site pocket. These subsites, called transition, active, and exit subsites allow docking, re-orientation, chiral selection, catalysis, and exit of the free D-amino acid from DTD. Our studies reveal variable modes of D-amino acid recognition by DTDs, suggesting an inherent plasticity that can accommodate all D-amino acids. An in-depth analysis of native, ADP-bound, and D-amino acid-complexed DTD structures provide the first atomic snapshots of ligand recognition and subsequent catalysis by this enzyme family. We have mapped sites for the deacylation reaction and mark possible routes for entry and egress of all substrates and products. We have also performed structure-based inhibitor discovery and tested lead compounds against the malaria parasite P. falciparum using growth inhibition assays. Our studies provide a comprehensive structural basis for the catalytic mechanism of DTD enzymes and have implications for inhibition of this enzyme in P. falciparum as a route to inhibiting the parasite.</p>

<p>Passage of poliovirus (PV) or foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the presence of ribavirin selected for viruses with decreased sensitivity to R, which included different mutations in their polymerase (3D): G64S located in the finger subdomain in the case of PV and M296I located within loop beta9-alpha11 at the active site in the case of FMDV. To investigate why disparate substitutions were selected in two closely related 3Ds, we constructed FMDVs with a 3D that included either G62S (the equivalent replacement in FMDV of PV G64S), M296I, or both substitutions. G62S, but not M296I, inflicts upon FMDV a strong selective disadvantage which is partially compensated for by the substitution M296I. The corresponding mutant polymerases, 3D(G62S), 3D(M296I), and 3D(G62S-M296I), were analyzed functionally and structurally. G62S in 3D impairs RNA-binding, polymerization, and R monophosphate incorporation activities. The X-ray structures of the 3D(G62S)-RNA, 3D(M296I)-RNA, and 3D(G62S-M296I)-RNA complexes show that although the two positions are separated by 13.1 A, the loops where the replacements reside are tightly connected through an extensive network of interactions that reach the polymerase active site. In particular, G62S seems to restrict the flexibility of loop beta9-alpha11 and, as a consequence, the flexibility of the active site and its ability to bind the RNA template. Thus, a localized change in the finger subdomain of 3D may affect the catalytic domain. The results provide a structural interpretation of why different amino acid substitutions were selected to confer R resistance in closely related viruses and reveal a complex network of intra-3D interactions that can affect the recognition of both the RNA template and incoming nucleotide.</p>

<p>DNA polymerase (pol) β is a model polymerase involved in gap-filling DNA synthesis utilizing two metals to facilitate nucleotidyl transfer. Previous structural studies have trapped catalytic intermediates by utilizing substrate analogs (dideoxy-terminated primer or nonhydrolysable incoming nucleotide). To identify additional intermediates during catalysis, we now employ natural substrates (correct and incorrect nucleotides) and follow product formation in real time with 15 different crystal structures. We are able to observe molecular adjustments at the active site that hasten correct nucleotide insertion and deter incorrect insertion not appreciated previously. A third metal binding site is transiently formed during correct, but not incorrect, nucleotide insertion. Additionally, long incubations indicate that pyrophosphate more easily dissociates after incorrect, compared to correct, nucleotide insertion. This appears to be coupled to subdomain repositioning that is required for catalytic activation/deactivation.

<p>Inhibition of the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF) has long been a focus in the treatment of both cancer and infectious diseases. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which catalyzes the last step, is one of the most thoroughly explored targets of this pathway, but there are no DHFR inhibitors used for tuberculosis treatment. Here, we report a structural, site-directed mutagenesis and calorimetric analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DHFR (MtDHFR) in complex with classical DHFR inhibitors. Our study provides insights into the weak inhibition of MtDHFR by trimethoprim and other antifolate drugs, such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. The construction of the mutant Y100F, together with calorimetric studies, gives insights into low affinity of MtDHFR for classical DHFR inhibitors. Finally, the structures of MtDHFR in complex with pyrimethamine and cycloguanil define important interactions in the active site and provide clues to the more effective design of antibiotics targeted against MtDHFR. </p>

This appears to be coupled to subdomain repositioning that is required for catalytic activation/deactivation.

<p>The active estrogen estradiol (E2) stimulates breast cancer cell (BCC) growth, whereas the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) has shown an antiproliferative effect. The principal product synthesized by the 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-HSD1) is E2, although we have demonstrated that the purified enzyme also inactivates DHT. However, the direct roles of 17beta-HSD1 in sex-hormone regulation and BCC proliferation have not been completely established. Here, we show that 17beta-HSD1 inhibition suppresses DHT catabolism by 19%, whereas knockdown of the gene expression increases the concentration of DHT by 41% in the T47D BCC line. The 17beta-HSD1/DHT complex crystal structure reveals that DHT binds in both normal and reverse modes, but the latter mode leading to O3 reduction is preferred with stronger interactions. Using RNA interference and an inhibitor of 17beta-HSD1, we demonstrate that 17beta-HSD1 expression is negatively correlated to DHT levels in BCC but positively correlated to estrone reduction, E2 levels, and cell proliferation. 17beta-HSD1 inhibition reduces DHT inactivation, increasing the antiproliferative effect by DHT in T47D cells after 8 d treatment. Thus, 17beta-HSD1 up-regulates BCC growth by a dual action on estradiol synthesis and DHT inactivation. We have further demonstrated that 17beta-HSD1 can enhance the E2-induced expression of the endogenous estrogen-responsive gene pS2, providing an important information regarding the modulation of the estrogen responsiveness by 17beta-HSD1 that may also contribute to BCC growth. These results strongly support the rationale for inhibiting 17beta-HSD1 in breast cancer therapy to eliminate estrogen activation via the sulfatase pathway while avoiding the deprivation of DHT.</p>

<p>Glucansucrases are large enzymes belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 70, which catalyze the cleavage of sucrose into fructose and glucose, with the concomitant transfer of the glucose residue to a growing α-glucan polymer. Among others, plaque-forming oral bacteria secrete these enzymes to produce α-glucans, which facilitate the adhesion of the bacteria to the tooth enamel. We determined the crystal structure of a fully active, 1,031-residue fragment encompassing the catalytic and C-terminal domains of GTF180 from Lactobacillus reuteri 180, both in the native state, and in complexes with sucrose and maltose. These structures show that the enzyme has an α-amylase-like (β/α)(8)-barrel catalytic domain that is circularly permuted compared to the catalytic domains of members of glycoside hydrolase families 13 and 77, which belong to the same GH-H superfamily. In contrast to previous suggestions, the enzyme has only one active site and one nucleophilic residue. Surprisingly, in GTF180 the peptide chain follows a "U"-path, such that four of the five domains are made up from discontiguous N- and C-terminal stretches of the peptide chain. Finally, the structures give insight into the factors that determine the different linkage types in the polymeric product.</p>

<p>The structure-based design and synthesis of a novel series of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors with selectivity against p38 is reported. The unique structure of 3,5-disubstituted quinolines (2) was developed from the previously reported 4-(2,7-phenanthrolin-9-yl)phenol (1). The X-ray crystal structure of 16a in JNK3 reveals an unexpected binding mode for this new scaffold with protein.</p>

<p>The tandem BRCT domains of BRCA1 and MDC1 facilitate protein signaling at DNA damage foci through specific interactions with serine-phosphorylated protein partners. The MDC1 BRCT binds pSer-Gln-Glu-Tyr-COO(-) at the C terminus of the histone variant gammaH2AX via direct recognition of the C-terminal carboxylate, while BRCA1 recognizes pSer-X-X-Phe motifs either at C-terminal or internal sites within target proteins. Using fluorescence polarization binding assays, we show that while both BRCTs prefer a free main chain carboxylate at the +3 position, this preference is much more pronounced in MDC1. Crystal structures of BRCA1 and MDC1 bound to tetrapeptide substrates reveal differences in the environment of conserved arginines (Arg1699 in BRCA1 and Arg1933 in MDC1) that determine the relative affinity for peptides with -COO(-) versus -CO-NH(2) termini. A mutation in MDC1 that induces a more BRCA1-like conformation relaxes the binding specificity, allowing the mutant to bind phosphopeptides lacking a -COO(-) terminus.</p>

<p>HIV-1 develops resistance to protease inhibitors predominantly by selecting mutations in the protease gene. Studies of resistant mutants of HIV-1 protease with single amino acid substitutions have shown a range of independent effects on specificity, inhibition, and stability. Four double mutants, K45I/L90M, K45I/V82S, D30N/V82S, and N88D/L90M were selected for analysis on the basis of observations of increased or decreased stability or enzymatic activity for the respective single mutants. The double mutants were assayed for catalysis, inhibition, and stability. Crystal structures were analyzed for the double mutants at resolutions of 2.2-1.2 A to determine the associated molecular changes. Sequence-dependent changes in protease-inhibitor interactions were observed in the crystal structures. Mutations D30N, K45I, and V82S showed altered interactions with inhibitor residues at P2/P2', P3/P3'/P4/P4', and P1/P1', respectively. One of the conformations of Met90 in K45I/L90M has an unfavorably close contact with the carbonyl oxygen of Asp25, as observed previously in the L90M single mutant. The observed catalytic efficiency and inhibition for the double mutants depended on the specific substrate or inhibitor. In particular, large variation in cleavage of p6(pol)-PR substrate was observed, which is likely to result in defects in the maturation of the protease from the Gag-Pol precursor and hence viral replication. Three of the double mutants showed values for stability that were intermediate between the values observed for the respective single mutants. D30N/V82S mutant showed lower stability than either of the two individual mutations, which is possibly due to concerted changes in the central P2-P2' and S2-S2' sites. The complex effects of combining mutations are discussed.</p>

<p>The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is activated in response to DNA damage, leading to monoubiquitination of the substrates FANCI and FANCD2 by the FA core complex. Here we report the crystal structure of FANCL, the catalytic subunit of the FA core complex, at 3.2 A. The structure reveals an architecture fundamentally different from previous sequence-based predictions. The molecule is composed of an N-terminal E2-like fold, which we term the ELF domain, a novel double-RWD (DRWD) domain, and a C-terminal really interesting new gene (RING) domain predicted to facilitate E2 binding. Binding assays show that the DRWD domain, but not the ELF domain, is responsible for substrate binding.</p>

<p>Pyrrolysine (Pyl), the 22nd natural amino acid and genetically encoded by UAG, becomes attached to its cognate tRNA by pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS). We have determined three crystal structures of the Methanosarcina mazei PylRS complexed with either AMP-PNP, Pyl-AMP plus pyrophosphate, or the Pyl analogue N-epsilon-[(cylopentyloxy)carbonyl]-L-lysine plus ATP. The structures reveal that PylRS utilizes a deep hydrophobic pocket for recognition of the Pyl side chain. A comparison of these structures with previously determined class II tRNA synthetase complexes illustrates that different substrate specificities derive from changes in a small number of residues that form the substrate side-chain-binding pocket. The knowledge of these structures allowed the placement of PylRS in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) tree as the last known synthetase that evolved for genetic code expansion, as well as the finding that Pyl arose before the last universal common ancestral state. The PylRS structure provides an excellent framework for designing new aaRSs with altered amino acid specificity.</p>

<p>Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a large family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP and are implicated in various diseases. We describe the high-resolution crystal structures of the catalytic domains of PDE4B, PDE4D, and PDE5A with ten different inhibitors, including the drug candidates cilomilast and roflumilast, for respiratory diseases. These cocrystal structures reveal a common scheme of inhibitor binding to the PDEs: (i) a hydrophobic clamp formed by highly conserved hydrophobic residues that sandwich the inhibitor in the active site; (ii) hydrogen bonding to an invariant glutamine that controls the orientation of inhibitor binding. A scaffold can be readily identified for any given inhibitor based on the formation of these two types of conserved interactions. These structural insights will enable the design of isoform-selective inhibitors with improved binding affinity and should facilitate the discovery of more potent and selective PDE inhibitors for the treatment of a variety of diseases.</p>

<p>Bacteriophage murein hydrolases exhibit high specificity towards the cell walls of their host bacteria. This specificity is mostly provided by a structurally well defined cell wall-binding domain that attaches the enzyme to its solid substrate. To gain deeper insight into this mechanism we have crystallized the complete 314 amino acid endolysin from the temperate Listeria monocytogenes phage PSA. The crystal structure of PlyPSA was determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion methods and refined to 1.8 A resolution. The two functional domains of the polypeptide, providing cell wall-binding and enzymatic activities, can be clearly distinguished and are connected via a linker segment of six amino acid residues. The core of the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase moiety is formed by a twisted, six-stranded beta-sheet flanked by six helices. Although the catalytic domain is unique among the known Listeria phage endolysins, its structure is highly similar to known phosphorylase/hydrolase-like alpha/beta-proteins, including an autolysin amidase from Paenibacillus polymyxa. In contrast, the C-terminal domain of PlyPSA features a novel fold, comprising two copies of a beta-barrel-like motif, which are held together by means of swapped beta-strands. The architecture of the enzyme with its two separate domains explains its unique substrate recognition properties and also provides insight into the lytic mechanisms of related Listeria phage endolysins, a class of enzymes that bear biotechnological potential.</p>

<p>The Met-542 residue of β-galactosidase is important for the enzyme's activity because it acts as a guide for the movement of the benzyl side chain of Phe-601 between two stable positions. This movement occurs in concert with an important conformational change (open vs. closed) of an active site loop (residues 794-803). Phe-601 and Arg-599, which interact with each other via the π electrons of Phe-601 and the guanidium cation of Arg-599, move out of their normal positions and become disordered when Met-542 is replaced by an Ala residue because of the loss of the guide. Since the backbone carbonyl of Phe-601 is a ligand for Na(+), the Na(+) also moves out of its normal position and becomes disordered; the Na(+) binds about 120 times more poorly. In turn, two other Na(+) ligands, Asn-604 and Asp-201, become disordered. A substrate analog (IPTG) restored Arg-599, Phe-601, and Na(+) to their normal open-loop positions, whereas a transition state analog d-galactonolactone) restored them to their normal closed-loop positions. These compounds also restored order to Phe-601, Asn-604, Asp-201, and Na(+). Binding energy was, however, necessary to restore structure and order. The K(s) values of oNPG and pNPG and the competitive K(i) values of substrate analogs were 90-250 times higher than with native enzyme, whereas the competitive K(i) values of transition state analogs were ~3.5-10 times higher. Because of this, the E•S energy level is raised more than the E•transition state energy level and less activation energy is needed for galactosylation. The galactosylation rates (k₂) of M542A-β-galactosidase therefore increase. However, the rate of degalactosylation (k₃) decreased because the E•transition state complex is less stable.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible oxidation of carbon monoxide with water to carbon dioxide, two protons, and two electrons. The CODHs of anaerobic microorganisms harbor a complex Ni/Fe/S-containing metal center called a C-cluster in their active site, which activates the substrates water and carbon monoxide, stabilizes an intermediary metal-carboxylate, and transiently stores the two electrons generated in the reaction. Several small molecules have been reported to inhibit carbon monoxide oxidation by CODHs, among which the cyanide anion acts as a slow binding inhibitor. Cyanide is isoelectronic to the substrate carbon monoxide, and its binding to the C-cluster has been reported to involve nickel, nickel and iron, or only iron. We report the crystal structure of CODH-II from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans in complex with cyanide at 1.36 A resolution. The structure reveals that cyanide binds to the C-cluster at an open coordination site completing the square-planar coordination geometry of the nickel ion. While active CODH has a water/hydroxo-ligand bound to an iron ion near nickel, in the cyanide complex the water/hydroxo-ligand is lost and iron occupies a position more close to the nickel ion. Based on the structure, we suggest that the competitive inhibitory character of cyanide originates from it obstruction of carbon monoxide binding to the nickel ion while the slow binding inhibition is due to a conformational change of the protein during which the water/hydroxo-ligand bound to iron is lost.</p>

<p>Phospholipase A2 is potentially an important target for structure-based rational drug design. In order to determine the involvement of phospholipase A2 in the action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the crystal structure of the complex formed between phospholipase A2 and aspirin has been determined at 1.9 angstroms resolution. The structure contains 915 protein atoms, 1 calcium ion, 13 atoms of aspirin and 105 water molecules. The observed electron density of the aspirin molecule in the structure was of very high quality thus allowing the precise determination of its atomic coordinates leading to the clear description of its interactions with the enzyme. The structure of the complex clearly shows that aspirin is literally embedded in the hydrophobic environment of PLA2. It is so placed in the substrate binding channel that it forms several important attractive interactions with calcium ion, His 48 and Asp 49. Thus, the structure of the complex clearly shows that aspirin occupies a favourable place in the specific binding site of PLA2. The binding studies have shown that acetyl salicylate (aspirin) binds to PLA2 enzyme specifically with a dissociation constant of 6.4 x 10(-6) M. The structural details and binding data suggest that the inhibition of PLA2 by aspirin is of pharmacological</p>

<p>The SET- and MYND-domain containing (Smyd) proteins constitute a special subfamily of the SET-containing lysine methyltransferases. Here we present the structure of full-length human Smyd3 in complex with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine at 2.8 Å resolution. Smyd3 affords the first example that other region(s) besides the SET domain and its flanking regions participate in the formation of the active site. Structural analysis shows that the previously uncharacterized C-terminal domain of Smyd3 contains a tetratrico-peptide repeat (TPR) domain which together with the SET and post-SET domains forms a deep, narrow substrate binding pocket. Our data demonstrate the important roles of both TPR and post-SET domains in the histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMT) activity of Smyd3, and show that the hydroxyl group of Tyr239 is critical for the enzymatic activity. The characteristic MYND domain is located nearby to the substrate binding pocket and exhibits a largely positively charged surface. Further biochemical assays show that DNA binding of Smyd3 can stimulate its HKMT activity and the process may be mediated via the MYND domain through direct DNA binding.</p>

<p>The increasing spread of plasmid-borne ampC-ampR operons is of considerable medical importance, since the AmpC beta-lactamases they encode confer high level resistance to many third generation cephalosporins. Induction of AmpC beta-lactamase from endogenous or plasmid-borne ampC-ampR operons is mediated by a catabolic inducer molecule, 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) tripeptide, an intermediate of the cell wall recycling pathway derived from the peptidoglycan. Here we describe a strategy for attenuating the antibiotic resistance associated with the ampC-ampR operon by blocking the formation of the inducer molecule using small molecule inhibitors of NagZ, the glycoside hydrolase catalyzing the formation of this inducer molecule. The structure of the NagZ-inhibitor complex provides insight into the molecular basis for inhibition and enables the development of inhibitors with 100-fold selectivity for NagZ over functionally related human enzymes. These PUGNAc-derived inhibitors reduce the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for several clinically relevant cephalosporins in both wild-type and AmpC-hyperproducing strains lacking functional AmpD.</p>

<p>Protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPN5, PTPRR and PTPN7 comprise a family of phosphatases that specifically inactivate MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases). We have determined high-resolution structures of all of the human family members, screened them against a library of 24000 compounds and identified two classes of inhibitors, cyclopenta[c]quinolinecarboxylic acids and 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl benzoic acids. Comparative structural analysis revealed significant differences within this conserved family that could be explored for the design of selective inhibitors. PTPN5 crystallized, in two distinct crystal forms, with a sulphate ion in close proximity to the active site and the WPD (Trp-Pro-Asp) loop in a unique conformation, not seen in other PTPs, ending in a 3(10)-helix. In the PTPN7 structure, the WPD loop was in the closed conformation and part of the KIM (kinase-interaction motif) was visible, which forms an N-terminal aliphatic helix with the phosphorylation site Thr66 in an accessible position. The WPD loop of PTPRR was open; however, in contrast with the structure of its mouse homologue, PTPSL, a salt bridge between the conserved lysine and aspartate residues, which has been postulated to confer a more rigid loop structure, thereby modulating activity in PTPSL, does not form in PTPRR. One of the identified inhibitor scaffolds, cyclopenta[c]quinoline, was docked successfully into PTPRR, suggesting several possibilities for hit expansion. The determined structures together with the established SAR (structure-activity relationship) propose new avenues for the development of selective inhibitors that may have therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases in the case of PTPRR or acute myeloblastic leukaemia targeting PTPN7.</p>

<p>Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) are secreted or membrane-bound ectonucleotidases that hydrolyze the anhydride bonds of nucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside diphosphates. Mammalian cell-surface NTPDase enzymes are inhibited by various polyoxometallates. Here, the structures of NTPDase1 from the bacterium Legionella pneumophila (LpNTPDase1) in complex with the dodecatungstate POM-1, decavanadate and octamolybdate/heptamolybdate are described. The metal clusters are bound at different sites but always in a highly ordered fashion via electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. For octamolybdate, covalent interactions after oxygen ligand exchange by a serine and histidine side chain are also observed. The potential inhibitory mechanism and the use of the metal clusters as phasing tools for new NTPDase structures are discussed. The binding mode of a tartrate ion at the catalytic centre suggests novel strategies for the structure-based design of NTPDase inhibitors, and the observation of the enzyme in an intermediate open state contributes to our understanding of NTPDase enzyme dynamics. </p>

<p>Mu-crystallin (CRYM), first described as a structural component of the eye lens in marsupials, has been characterized as an NADPH-dependent cytosolic T3 thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine) binding protein. More recently, CRYM has also been associated with ketimine reductase activity. Here, we report three crystal structures: mouse CRYM (mCRYM) in its apo form, in a form complexed with NADPH, and in a form with both NADPH and triiodothyronine bound. Comparison of the apo and NADPH forms reveals a rearrangement of the protein upon NADPH binding that reduces the degrees of freedom of several residues and traps the conformation of the binding pocket in a more T3 competent state. These findings are in agreement with the cooperative mechanism identified using isothermal titration calorimetry. Our structure with T3 reveals for the first time the location of the hormone binding site and shows its detailed interactions. T3 binding involves mainly hydrophobic interactions. Only five residues, either directly or through bridging water molecules, are hydrogen bonded to the hormone. Using in silico docking analysis, a series of ring-containing hydrophobic molecules were identified as potential mCRYM ligands, suggesting that the specificity for the recognition of the hydrophobic part of the hormone might be low. This is in agreement with the ketimine reductase activity that has been identified for ovine CRYM, as it demonstrates how a protein known as a thyroid hormone transporter can accommodate the ringed molecules required for its ketimine reductase activity. In the light of our results, a putative role of CRYM in thyroid hormone metabolism is also discussed.</p>

<p>The soil-dwelling microbe, Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3, has attracted recent attention due to its ability to survive on 4-chlorobenzoate as its sole carbon source. The biochemical pathway by which this organism converts 4-chlorobenzoate to 4-hydroxybenzoate consists of three enzymes: 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA ligase, 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase, and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of the thioesterase determined to 2.0-A resolution. Each subunit of the homotetramer is characterized by a five-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet and three major alpha-helices. While previous amino acid sequence analyses failed to reveal any similarity between this thioesterase and other known proteins, the results from this study clearly demonstrate that the molecular architecture of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase is topologically equivalent to that observed for beta-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase from Escherichia coli. On the basis of the structural similarity between these two enzymes, the active site of the thioesterase has been identified and a catalytic mechanism proposed.</p>

<p>Sirtuins are protein deacetylases regulating metabolism and stress responses. The seven human Sirtuins (Sirt1-7) are attractive drug targets, but Sirtuin inhibition mechanisms are mostly unidentified. We report the molecular mechanism of Sirtuin inhibition by 6-chloro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide (Ex-527). Inhibitor binding to potently inhibited Sirt1 and Thermotoga maritima Sir2 and to moderately inhibited Sirt3 requires NAD(+), alone or together with acetylpeptide. Crystal structures of several Sirtuin inhibitor complexes show that Ex-527 occupies the nicotinamide site and a neighboring pocket and contacts the ribose of NAD(+) or of the coproduct 2'-O-acetyl-ADP ribose. Complex structures with native alkylimidate and thio-analog support its catalytic relevance and show, together with biochemical assays, that only the coproduct complex is relevant for inhibition by Ex-527, which stabilizes the closed enzyme conformation preventing product release. Ex-527 inhibition thus exploits Sirtuin catalysis, and kinetic isoform differences explain its selectivity. Our results provide insights in Sirtuin catalysis and inhibition with important implications for drug development. </p>

<p>Toxin B is a member of the family of large clostridial cytotoxins which are of great medical importance. Its catalytic fragment was crystallized in the presence of UDP-glucose and Mn2+. The structure was determined at 2.2 A resolution, showing that toxin B belongs to the glycosyltransferase type A family. However, toxin B contains as many as 309 residues in addition to the common chainfold, which most likely contribute to the target specificity. A superposition with other glycosyltransferases shows the expected positions of the acceptor oxygen atom during glucosyl transfer and indicates further that the reaction proceeds probably along a single-displacement pathway. The C1'' donor carbon atom position is defined by the bound UDP and glucose. It assigns the surface area of toxin B that forms the interface to the target protein during the modifying reaction. A docking attempt brought the known acceptor atom, Thr37 O(gamma1) of the switch I region of the RhoA:GDP target structure, near the expected position. The relative orientation of the two proteins was consistent with both being attached to a membrane. Sequence comparisons between toxin B variants revealed that the highest exchange rate occurs around the active center at the putative docking interface, presumably due to a continuous hit-and-evasion struggle between Clostridia and their eukaryotic hosts.</p>

<p>p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) is a homodimeric flavoprotein monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoate to form 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate. Controlled catalysis is achieved by movement of the flavin and protein between three conformations, in, out, and open [Entsch, B., et al. (2005) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 433, 297-311]. The open conformation is important for substrate binding and product release, the in conformation for reaction with oxygen and hydroxylation, and the out conformation for the reduction of FAD by NADPH. The open conformation is similar to the structure of Arg220Gln-PHBH in which the backbone peptide loop of residues 43-46, located on the si side of the flavin, is rotated. In this paper, we examine the structure and properties of the Ala45Gly-PHBH mutant enzyme. The crystal structure of the Ala45Gly enzyme is an asymmetric dimer, with one monomer similar (but not identical) to wild-type PHBH, while the other monomer has His72 flipped into solvent and replaced with Glu73 as one of several changes in the structure. The two structures correlate with evidence from kinetic studies for two forms of Ala45Gly-PHBH. One form of the enzyme dominates turnover and hydroxylates, while the other contributes little to turnover and fails to hydroxylate. Ala45Gly-PHBH favors the in conformation over alternative conformations. The effect of this mutation on the structure and function of PHBH illustrates the importance of the si side loop in the conformational state of PHBH and, consequently, the function of the enzyme. This work demonstrates some general principles of how enzymes use conformational movements to allow both access and egress of substrates and product, while restricting access to the solvent at a critical stage in catalysis.</p>

<p>Activation of the pro-drug isoniazid (INH) as an anti-tubercular drug in Mycobacterium tuberculosis involves its conversion to isonicotinyl-NAD, a reaction that requires the catalase-peroxidase KatG. This report shows that the reaction proceeds in the absence of KatG at a slow rate in a mixture of INH, NAD(+), Mn(2+), and O(2), and that the inclusion of KatG increases the rate by &gt;7 times. Superoxide, generated by either Mn(2+)- or KatG-catalyzed reduction of O(2), is an essential intermediate in the reaction. Elimination of the peroxidatic process by mutation slows the rate of reaction by 60% revealing that the peroxidatic process enhances, but is not essential for isonicotinyl-NAD formation. The isonicotinyl-NAD(*+) radical is identified as a reaction intermediate, and its reduction by superoxide is proposed. Binding sites for INH and its co-substrate, NAD(+), are identified for the first time in crystal complexes of Burkholderia pseudomallei catalase-peroxidase with INH and NAD(+) grown by co-crystallization. The best defined INH binding sites were identified, one in each subunit, on the opposite side of the protein from the entrance to the heme cavity in a funnel-shaped channel. The NAD(+) binding site is approximately 20 A from the entrance to the heme cavity and involves interactions primarily with the AMP portion of the molecule in agreement with the NMR saturation transfer difference results.</p>

<p>GTP cyclohydrolase I catalyses the hydrolytic release of formate from GTP followed by cyclization to dihydroneopterin triphosphate. The enzymes from bacteria and animals are homodecamers containing one zinc ion per subunit. Replacement of Cys110, Cys181, His112 or His113 of the enzyme from Escherichia coli by serine affords catalytically inactive mutant proteins with reduced capacity to bind zinc. These mutant proteins are unable to convert GTP or the committed reaction intermediate, 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-(beta-ribosylamino)-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-triphosphate, to dihydroneopterin triphosphate. The crystal structures of GTP complexes of the His113Ser, His112Ser and Cys181Ser mutant proteins determined at resolutions of 2.5A, 2.8A and 3.2A, respectively, revealed the conformation of substrate GTP in the active site cavity. The carboxylic group of the highly conserved residue Glu152 anchors the substrate GTP, by hydrogen bonding to N-3 and to the position 2 amino group. Several basic amino acid residues interact with the triphosphate moiety of the substrate. The structure of the His112Ser mutant in complex with an undefined mixture of nucleotides determined at a resolution of 2.1A afforded additional details of the peptide folding. Comparison between the wild-type and mutant enzyme structures indicates that the catalytically active zinc ion is directly coordinated to Cys110, Cys181 and His113. Moreover, the zinc ion is complexed to a water molecule, which is in close hydrogen bond contact to His112. In close analogy to zinc proteases, the zinc-coordinated water molecule is suggested to attack C-8 of the substrate affording a zinc-bound 8R hydrate of GTP. Opening of the hydrated imidazole ring affords a formamide derivative, which remains coordinated to zinc. The subsequent hydrolysis of the formamide motif has an absolute requirement for zinc ion catalysis. The hydrolysis of the formamide bond shows close mechanistic similarity with peptide hydrolysis by zinc proteases.</p>

<p>Using computer aided modelling studies, a new extended P2/S2 interaction was identified. This extended region can accommodate a variety of functional groups, such as aryls and basic amines. It was discovered that the N3 nitrogen of the pyrimidine-2-carbonitrile is critical for its cathepsin cysteine protease inhibition. N1 nitrogen also contributes to the inhibitory activity, but to a very limited degree. An 'in situ double activation' mechanism was proposed to explain these results.</p>

<p>The specific insertion of a divalent metal ion into tetrapyrrole macrocycles is catalyzed by a group of enzymes called chelatases. Distortion of the tetrapyrrole has been proposed to be an important component of the mechanism of metallation. We present the structures of two different inhibitor complexes: (1) N-methylmesoporphyrin (N-MeMP) with the His183Ala variant of Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase; (2) the wild-type form of the same enzyme with deuteroporphyrin IX 2,4-disulfonic acid dihydrochloride (dSDP). Analysis of the structures showed that only one N-MeMP isomer out of the eight possible was bound to the protein and it was different from the isomer that was earlier found to bind to the wild-type enzyme. A comparison of the distortion of this porphyrin with other porphyrin complexes of ferrochelatase and a catalytic antibody with ferrochelatase activity using normal-coordinate structural decomposition reveals that certain types of distortion are predominant in all these complexes. On the other hand, dSDP, which binds closer to the protein surface compared to N-MeMP, does not undergo any distortion upon binding to the protein, underscoring that the position of the porphyrin within the active site pocket is crucial for generating the distortion required for metal insertion. In addition, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, Cu(2+)-soaking of the His183Ala variant complex did not show any traces of porphyrin metallation. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the role of the active site residues of ferrochelatase in controlling stereospecificity, distortion and metallation.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of toluene 4-monooxygenase hydroxylase in complex with reaction products and effector protein reveal active site interactions leading to regiospecificity. Complexes with phenolic products yield an asymmetric μ-phenoxo-bridged diiron center and a shift of diiron ligand E231 into a hydrogen bonding position with conserved T201. In contrast, complexes with inhibitors p-NH(2)-benzoate and p-Br-benzoate showed a μ-1,1 coordination of carboxylate oxygen between the iron atoms and only a partial shift in the position of E231. Among active site residues, F176 trapped the aromatic ring of products against a surface of the active site cavity formed by G103, E104 and A107, while F196 positioned the aromatic ring against this surface via a π-stacking interaction. The proximity of G103 and F176 to the para substituent of the substrate aromatic ring and the structure of G103L T4moHD suggest how changes in regiospecificity arise from mutations at G103. Although effector protein binding produced significant shifts in the positions of residues along the outer portion of the active site (T201, N202, and Q228) and in some iron ligands (E231 and E197), surprisingly minor shifts (&lt;1 Å) were produced in F176, F196, and other interior residues of the active site. Likewise, products bound to the diiron center in either the presence or absence of effector protein did not significantly shift the position of the interior residues, suggesting that positioning of the cognate substrates will not be strongly influenced by effector protein binding. Thus, changes in product distributions in the absence of the effector protein are proposed to arise from differences in rates of chemical steps of the reaction relative to motion of substrates within the active site channel of the uncomplexed, less efficient enzyme, while structural changes in diiron ligand geometry associated with cycling between diferrous and diferric states are discussed for their potential contribution to product release.</p>

<p>The design and synthesis of a series of seven tricyclic 6-methylidene penems as novel class A and C serine beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. These compounds proved to be very potent inhibitors of the TEM-1 and AmpC beta-lactamases and less so against the class B metallo-beta-lactamase CcrA. In combination with piperacillin, their in vitro activities enhanced susceptibility of all class C resistant strains from various bacteria. Crystallographic structures of a serine-bound reaction intermediate of 17 with the class A SHV-1 and class C GC1 enzymes have been established to resolutions of 2.0 and 1.4 A, respectively, and refined to R-factors equal 0.163 and 0.145. In both beta-lactamases, a seven-membered 1,4-thiazepine ring has formed. The stereogenic C7 atom in the ring has the R configuration in the SHV-1 intermediate and has both R and S configurations in the GC1 intermediate. Hydrophobic stacking interactions between the tricyclic C7 substituent and a tyrosine side chain, rather than electrostatic or hydrogen bonding by the C3 carboxylic acid group, dominate in both complexes. The formation of the 1,4- thiazepine ring structures is proposed based on a 7-endo-trig cyclization.</p>

<p>The number of available protein sequences has increased exponentially with the advent of high-throughput genomic sequencing, creating a significant challenge for functional annotation. Here, we describe a large-scale study on assigning function to unknown members of the trans-polyprenyl transferase (E-PTS) subgroup in the isoprenoid synthase superfamily, which provides substrates for the biosynthesis of the more than 55,000 isoprenoid metabolites. Although the mechanism for determining the product chain length for these enzymes is known, there is no simple relationship between function and primary sequence, so that assigning function is challenging. We addressed this challenge through large-scale bioinformatics analysis of &gt;5,000 putative polyprenyl transferases; experimental characterization of the chain-length specificity of 79 diverse members of this group; determination of 27 structures of 19 of these enzymes, including seven cocrystallized with substrate analogs or products; and the development and successful application of a computational approach to predict function that leverages available structural data through homology modeling and docking of possible products into the active site. The crystallographic structures and computational structural models of the enzyme-ligand complexes elucidate the structural basis of specificity. As a result of this study, the percentage of E-PTS sequences similar to functionally annotated ones (BLAST e-value ≤ 1e(-70)) increased from 40.6 to 68.8%, and the percentage of sequences similar to available crystal structures increased from 28.9 to 47.4%. The high accuracy of our blind prediction of newly characterized enzymes indicates the potential to predict function to the complete polyprenyl transferase subgroup of the isoprenoid synthase superfamily computationally.</p>

<p>Initially identified in yeast, the exosome has emerged as a central component of the RNA maturation and degradation machinery both in Archaea and eukaryotes. Here we describe a series of high-resolution structures of the RNase PH ring from the Pyrococcus abyssi exosome, one of them containing three 10-mer RNA strands within the exosome catalytic chamber, and report additional nucleotide interactions involving positions N5 and N7. Residues from all three Rrp41-Rrp42 heterodimers interact with a single RNA molecule, providing evidence for the functional relevance of exosome ring-like assembly in RNA processivity. Furthermore, an ADP-bound structure showed a rearrangement of nucleotide interactions at site N1, suggesting a rationale for the elimination of nucleoside diphosphate after catalysis. In combination with RNA degradation assays performed with mutants of key amino acid residues, the structural data presented here provide support for a model of exosome-mediated RNA degradation that integrates the events involving catalytic cleavage, product elimination, and RNA translocation. Finally, comparisons between the archaeal and human exosome structures provide a possible explanation for the eukaryotic exosome inability to catalyze phosphate-dependent RNA degradation.</p>

<p>Enhanced receptor selectivity: carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are relevant for both cancer diagnosis and therapy. Combining non-radioactive Re compounds with their radioactive (99m)Tc homologs enables the use of identical molecules for therapy and imaging (theragnostic). The syntheses and in vitro evaluation of [(Cp-R)M(CO)(3)] (Cp=cyclopentadienyl, M=Re, (99m)Tc) with R being a highly potent carbonic-anhydrase-targeting vector is reported.</p>

<p>Oxidation of genomic DNA forms the guanine lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). When in the template base position during DNA synthesis the 8-oxoG lesion has dual coding potential by virtue of its anti- and syn-conformations, base pairing with cytosine and adenine, respectively. This impacts mutagenesis, because insertion of adenine opposite template 8-oxoG can result in a G to T transversion. DNA polymerases vary by orders of magnitude in their preferences for mutagenic vs. error-free 8-oxoG lesion bypass. Yet, the structural basis for lesion bypass specificity is not well understood. The DNA base excision repair enzyme DNA polymerase (pol) β is presented with gap-filling synthesis opposite 8-oxoG during repair and has similar insertion efficiencies for dCTP and dATP. We report the structure of pol β in binary complex with template 8-oxoG in a base excision repair substrate. The structure reveals both the syn- and anti-conformations of template 8-oxoG in the confines of the polymerase active site, consistent with the dual coding observed kinetically for this enzyme. A ternary complex structure of pol β with the syn-8-oxoG:anti-A Hoogsteen base pair in the closed fully assembled preinsertion active site is also reported. The syn-conformation of 8-oxoG is stabilized by minor groove hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Arg283 and O8 of 8-oxoG. An adjustment in the position of the phosphodiester backbone 5'-phosphate enables 8-oxoG to adopt the syn-conformation.</p>

<p>An efficient method has been developed to synthesize casimiroin (1), a component of the edible fruit of Casimiroa edulis, on a multigram scale in good overall yield. The route was versatile enough to provide an array of compound 1 analogues that were evaluated as QR2 and aromatase inhibitors. In addition, X-ray crystallography studies of QR2 in complex with compound 1 and one of its more potent analogues has provided insight into the mechanism of action of this new series of QR2 inhibitors. The initial biological investigations suggest that compound 1 and its analogues merit further investigation as potential chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents.</p>

<p>tRNAs from all 3 phylogenetic domains have a 5-methyluridine at position 54 (T54) in the T-loop. The methyl group is transferred from S-adenosylmethionine by TrmA methyltransferase in most Gram-negative bacteria and some archaea and eukaryotes, whereas it is transferred from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF) by TrmFO, a folate/FAD-dependent methyltransferase, in most Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria. However, the catalytic mechanism remains unclear, because the crystal structure of TrmFO has not been solved. Here, we report the crystal structures of Thermus thermophilus TrmFO in its free form, tetrahydrofolate (THF)-bound form, and glutathione-bound form at 2.1-, 1.6-, and 1.05-A resolutions, respectively. TrmFO consists of an FAD-binding domain and an insertion domain, which both share structural similarity with those of GidA, an enzyme involved in the 5-carboxymethylaminomethylation of U34 of some tRNAs. However, the overall structures of TrmFO and GidA are basically different because of their distinct domain orientations, which are consistent with their respective functional specificities. In the THF complex, the pteridin ring of THF is sandwiched between the flavin ring of FAD and the imidazole ring of a His residue. This structure provides a snapshot of the folate/FAD-dependent methyl transfer, suggesting that the transferring methylene group of MTHF is located close to the redox-active N5 atom of FAD. Furthermore, we established an in vitro system to measure the methylation activity. Our TrmFO-tRNA docking model, in combination with mutational analyses, suggests a catalytic mechanism, in which the methylene of MTHF is directly transferred onto U54, and then the exocyclic methylene of U54 is reduced by FADH(2).</p>

<p>In Salmonella typhimurium, formation of the cobalt-carbon bond in the biosynthetic pathway for adenosylcobalamin is catalyzed by the product of the cobA gene which encodes a protein of 196 amino acid residues. This enzyme is an ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase which transfers an adenosyl moiety from MgATP to a broad range of co(I)rrinoid substrates that are believed to include cobinamide, its precursor cobyric acid and probably others as yet unidentified, and hydroxocobalamin. Three X-ray structures of CobA are reported here: its substrate-free form, a complex of CobA with MgATP, and a ternary complex of CobA with MgATP and hydroxycobalamin to 2.1, 1.8, and 2.1 A resolution, respectively. These structures show that the enzyme is a homodimer. In the apo structure, the polypeptide chain extends from Arg(28) to Lys(181) and consists of an alpha/beta structure built from a six-stranded parallel beta-sheet with strand order 324516. The topology of this fold is very similar to that seen in RecA protein, helicase domain, F(1)ATPase, and adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide guanylyltransferase where a P-loop is located at the end of the first strand. Strikingly, the nucleotide in the MgATP.CobA complex binds to the P-loop of CobA in the opposite orientation compared to all the other nucleotide hydrolases. That is, the gamma-phosphate binds at the location normally occupied by the alpha-phosphate. The unusual orientation of the nucleotide arises because this enzyme transfers an adenosyl group rather than the gamma-phosphate. In the ternary complex, the binding site for hydroxycobalamin is located in a shallow bowl-shaped depression at the C-terminal end of the beta-sheet of one subunit; however, the active site is capped by the N-terminal helix from the symmetry-related subunit that now extends from Gln(7) to Ala(24). The lower ligand of cobalamin is well-ordered and interacts mostly with the N-terminal helix of the symmetry-related subunit. Interestingly, there are few interactions between the protein and the polar side chains of the corrin ring which accounts for the broad specificity of this enzyme. The corrin ring is oriented such that the cobalt atom is located approximately 6.1 A from C5' of the ribose and is beyond the range of nucleophilic attack. This suggests that a conformational change occurs in the ternary complex when Co(III) is reduced to Co(I).</p>

<p>In fragment-based drug discovery, the weak affinities exhibited by fragments pose significant challenges for screening. Biophysical techniques are used to address this challenge, but there is no clear consensus on which cascade of methods is best suited to identify fragment hits that ultimately translate into bound X-ray structures and provide bona fide starting points for synthesis. We have benchmarked an integrated biophysical approach for fragment screening and validation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis pantothenate synthetase. A primary screen of 1,250 fragments library was performed by thermal shift, followed by secondary screen using one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (water ligand observed gradient spectroscopy and saturation transfer difference binding experiments) and ultimate hit validation by isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography. Our multibiophysical approach identified three distinct binding sites for fragments and laid a solid foundation for successful structure-based elaboration into potent inhibitors. </p>

<p>The formation of glutaminyl transfer RNA (Gln-tRNA(Gln)) differs among the three domains of life. Most bacteria employ an indirect pathway to produce Gln-tRNA(Gln) by a heterotrimeric glutamine amidotransferase CAB (GatCAB) that acts on the misacylated Glu-tRNA(Gln). Here, we describe a series of crystal structures of intact GatCAB from Staphylococcus aureus in the apo form and in the complexes with glutamine, asparagine, Mn2+, and adenosine triphosphate analog. Two identified catalytic centers for the glutaminase and transamidase reactions are markedly distant but connected by a hydrophilic ammonia channel 30 A in length. Further, we show that the first U-A base pair in the acceptor stem and the D loop of tRNA(Gln) serve as identity elements essential for discrimination by GatCAB and propose a complete model for the overall concerted reactions to synthesize Gln-tRNA(Gln).</p>

<p>Flavin mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (FMNAT) catalyzes the formation of the essential flavocoenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and plays an important role in flavocoenzyme homeostasis regulation. By sequence comparison, bacterial and eukaryotic FMNAT enzymes belong to two different protein superfamilies and apparently utilize different sets of active-site residues to accomplish the same chemistry. Here we report the first structural characterization of a eukaryotic FMNAT from the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata. Four crystal structures of C. glabrata FMNAT in different complexed forms were determined at 1.20-1.95 A resolutions, capturing the enzyme active-site states prior to and after catalysis. These structures reveal a novel flavin-binding mode and a unique enzyme-bound FAD conformation. Comparison of the bacterial and eukaryotic FMNATs provides a structural basis for understanding the convergent evolution of the same FMNAT activity from different protein ancestors. Structure-based investigation of the kinetic properties of FMNAT should offer insights into the regulatory mechanisms of FAD homeostasis by FMNAT in eukaryotic organisms.</p>

<p>With the rapid rise of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, new strategies against S. aureus are urgently needed. De novo purine biosynthesis is a promising yet unexploited target, insofar as abundant evidence has shown that bacteria with compromised purine biosynthesis are attenuated. Fundamental differences exist within the process by which humans and bacteria convert 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to 4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR). In bacteria, this transformation occurs through a two-step conversion catalyzed by PurK and PurE; in humans, it is mediated by a one-step conversion catalyzed by class II PurE. Thus, these bacterial enzymes are potential targets for selective antibiotic development. Here, the first comprehensive structural and biochemical characterization of PurK and PurE from S. aureus is presented. Structural analysis of S. aureus PurK reveals a nonconserved phenylalanine near the AIR-binding site that occupies the putative position of the imidazole ring of AIR. Mutation of this phenylalanine to isoleucine or tryptophan reduced the enzyme efficiency by around tenfold. The K(m) for bicarbonate was determined for the first time for a PurK enzyme and was found to be ∼18.8 mM. The structure of PurE is described in comparison to that of human class II PurE. It is confirmed biochemically that His38 is essential for function. These studies aim to provide foundations for future structure-based drug-discovery efforts against S. aureus purine biosynthesis.</p>

<p>The structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis dUTP nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) has been determined at 1.3 Angstrom resolution in complex with magnesium ion and the non-hydrolyzable substrate analog, alpha,beta-imido dUTP. dUTPase is an enzyme essential for depleting potentially toxic concentrations of dUTP in the cell. Given the importance of its biological role, it has been proposed that inhibiting M.tuberculosis dUTPase might be an effective means to treat tuberculosis infection in humans. The crystal structure presented here offers some insight into the potential for designing a specific inhibitor of the M.tuberculosis dUTPase enzyme. The structure also offers new insights into the mechanism of dUTP hydrolysis by providing an accurate representation of the enzyme-substrate complex in which both the metal ion and dUTP analog are included. The structure suggests that inclusion of a magnesium ion is important for stabilizing the position of the alpha-phosphorus for an in-line nucleophilic attack. In the absence of magnesium, the alpha-phosphate of dUTP can have either of the two positions which differ by 4.5 Angstrom. A transiently ordered C-terminal loop further assists catalysis by shielding the general base, Asp83, from solvent thus elevating its pK(a) so that it might in turn activate a tightly bound water molecule for nucleophilic attack. The metal ion coordinates alpha, beta, and gamma phosphate groups with tridentate geometry identical with that observed in the crystal structure of DNA polymerase beta complexed with magnesium and dNTP analog, revealing some common features in catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>In plants and bacteria, the branch point of (S)-lysine biosynthesis is the condensation of (S)-aspartate-beta-semialdehyde and pyruvate, a reaction catalysed by dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS, E.C. 4.2.1.52). In this study, we probe the function of threonine 44 in Escherichia coli DHDPS, with respect to its role in the proton relay. Removal of the hydroxyl moiety of threonine 44, by mutation to valine, significantly attenuates activity (0.1% of wild-type) because the proton relay is broken. It was thus predicted that mutation of threonine 44 to serine would re-establish the proton relay and thus enzymatic activity. Following site-directed mutagenesis and purification to yield the DHDPS-Thr44Ser mutant enzyme, kinetic and structural studies were undertaken. The crystal structure of DHDPS-Thr44Ser showed that the active site was intact and that Ser44 and Tyr107 have some conformational flexibility, which is consistent with the observed loss of activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. Electron density was observed at the active site of DHDPS-Thr44Ser, which was identified as a trapped pyruvate analogue, alpha-ketoglutarate. The activity was indeed found to be increased relative to DHDPS-Thr44Val, but was still reduced to only approximately 8% of that of the wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, there was a shift in the kinetic mechanism, from the substituted-enzyme mechanism, observed in the wild-type, to the ternary-complex mechanism, consistent with the trapped substrate analogue. Increased flexibility in the active site appears to facilitate the binding/reaction of substrate analogues, suggesting that wild-type DHDPS has evolved a relatively rigid active site in order to maintain substrate specificity for pyruvate.</p>

<p>Simplified model binding sites allow one to isolate entangled terms in molecular energy functions. Here, we investigate the effects on ligand recognition of the introduction of a histidine into a hydrophobic cavity in lysozyme. We docked 656040 molecules and tested 26 highly and nine poorly ranked. Twenty-one highly ranked molecules bound and five were false positives, while three poorly ranked molecules were false negatives. In the 16 X-ray complexes now known, the docking predictions overlaid well with the crystallographic results. Although ligand enrichment was high, the false negatives, the false positives, and the inability to rank order illuminated weaknesses in our scoring, particularly overweighed apolar and underweighted polar terms. Adjusting these led to new problems, reflecting the entangled nature of docking scoring functions. Changes in ligand affinity relative to other lysozyme cavities speak to the subtleties of molecular recognition even in these simple sites and to their relevance for testing different models of recognition.</p>

Here, we investigate the effects on ligand recognition of the introduction of a histidine into a hydrophobic cavity in lysozyme. We docked 656040 molecules and tested 26 highly and nine poorly ranked. Twenty-one highly ranked molecules bound and five were false positives, while three poorly ranked molecules were false negatives. In the 16 X-ray complexes now known, the docking predictions overlaid well with the crystallographic results. Although ligand enrichment was high, the false negatives, the false positives, and the inability to rank order illuminated weaknesses in our scoring, particularly overweighed apolar and underweighted polar terms. Adjusting these led to new problems, reflecting the entangled nature of docking scoring functions.

<p>Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS, E.C. 4.2.1.52), a validated antibiotic target, catalyses the first committed step in the lysine biosynthetic pathway: the condensation reaction between (S)-aspartate beta-semialdehyde [(S)-ASA] and pyruvate via the formation of a Schiff base intermediate between pyruvate and the absolutely conserved active-site lysine. Escherichia coli DHDPS mutants K161A and K161R of the active-site lysine were characterised for the first time. Unexpectedly, the mutant enzymes were still catalytically active, albeit with a significant decrease in activity. The k(cat) values for DHDPS-K161A and DHDPS-K161R were 0.06 +/- 0.02 s(-1) and 0.16 +/- 0.06 s(-1) respectively, compared to 45 +/- 3 s(-1) for the wild-type enzyme. Remarkably, the K(M) values for pyruvate increased by only 3-fold for DHDPS-K161A and DHDPS-K161R (0.45 +/- 0.04 mM and 0.57 +/- 0.06 mM, compared to 0.15 +/- 0.01 mM for the wild-type DHDPS), while the K(M) values for (S)-ASA remained the same for DHDPS-K161R (0.12 +/- 0.01 mM) and increased by only 2-fold for DHDPS-K161A (0.23 +/- 0.02 mM) and the K(i) for lysine was unchanged. The X-ray crystal structures of DHDPS-K161A and DHDPS-K161R were solved at resolutions of 2.0 and 2.1 A respectively and showed no changes in their secondary or tertiary structures when compared to the wild-type structure. The crystal structure of DHDPS-K161A with pyruvate bound at the active site was solved at a resolution of 2.3 A and revealed a defined binding pocket for pyruvate that is thus not dependent upon lysine 161. Taken together with ITC and NMR data, it is concluded that although lysine 161 is important in the wild-type DHDPS-catalysed reaction, it is not absolutely essential for catalysis.</p>

<p>The E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah regulates key cellular events that are central to cancer development and progression. A promising route to Siah inhibition is disrupting its interactions with adaptor proteins. However, typical of protein-protein interactions, traditional unbiased approaches to ligand discovery did not produce viable hits against this target, despite considerable effort and a multitude of approaches. Ultimately, a rational structure-based design strategy was successful for the identification of Siah inhibitors in which peptide binding drives specific covalent bond formation with the target. X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, and functional data demonstrate that these peptide mimetics are efficient covalent inhibitors of Siah and antagonize Siah-dependent regulation of Erk and Hif signaling in the cell. The proposed strategy may result useful as a general approach to the design of peptide-based inhibitors of other protein-protein interactions. </p>

<p>Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe type of malaria, a life-threatening disease affecting the lives of over three billion people. Factors like widespread resistance against available drugs and absence of an effective vaccine are seriously compounding control of the malaria parasite. Thus, there is an urgent need for the identification and validation of new drug targets. The enzymes of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway have been suggested as possible targets for the treatment of malaria. One of these enzymes is spermidine synthase (SPDS, putrescine aminopropyltransferase), which catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl moiety from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) to putrescine, leading to the formation of spermidine and 5'-methylthioadenosine. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of P. falciparum spermidine synthase (pfSPDS) in apo form, in complex with dcAdoMet and two inhibitors, S-adenosyl-1,8-diamino-3-thio-octane (AdoDATO) and trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (4MCHA). The results show that binding of dcAdoMet to pfSPDS stabilizes the conformation of the flexible gatekeeper loop of the enzyme and affects the conformation of the active-site amino acid residues, preparing the protein for binding of the second substrate. The complexes of AdoDATO and 4MCHA with pfSPDS reveal the mode of interactions of these compounds with the enzyme. While AdoDATO essentially fills the entire active-site pocket, 4MCHA only occupies part of it, which suggests that simple modifications of this compound may yield more potent inhibitors of pfSPDS.</p>

<p>When methyl-substituted aromatic compounds are degraded via ortho (intradiol)-cleavage of 4-methylcatechol, the dead-end metabolite 4-methylmuconolactone (4-ML) is formed. Degradation of 4-ML has only been described in few bacterial species, including Pseudomonas reinekei MT1. The isomerization of 4-ML to 3-methylmuconolactone (3-ML) is the first step required for the mineralization of 4-ML and is catalyzed by an enzyme termed 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase (MLMI). We identified the gene encoding MLMI in P. reinekei MT1 and solved the crystal structures of MLMI in complex with 3-ML at 1.4-A resolution, with 4-ML at 1.9-A resolution and with a MES buffer molecule at 1.45-A resolution. MLMI exhibits a ferredoxin-like fold and assembles as a tight functional homodimeric complex. We were able to assign the active site clefts of MLMI from P. reinekei MT1 and of the homologous MLMI from Cupriavidus necator JMP134, which has previously been crystallized in a structural genomics project. Kinetic and structural analysis of wild-type MLMI and variants created by site-directed mutagenesis indicate Tyr-39 and His-26 to be the most probable catalytic residues. The previously proposed involvement of Cys-67 in covalent catalysis can now be excluded. Residue His-52 was found to be important for substrate affinity, with only marginal effect on catalytic activity. Based on these results, a novel catalytic mechanism for the isomerization of 4-ML to 3-ML by MLMI, involving a bislactonic intermediate, is proposed. This broadens the knowledge about the diverse group of proteins exhibiting a ferredoxin-like fold.</p>

<p>The X-ray crystal structure of recombinant PcISPS (isoprene synthase from gray poplar hybrid Populus×canescens) has been determined at 2.7 Å resolution, and the structure of its complex with three Mg(2+) and the unreactive substrate analogue dimethylallyl-S-thiolodiphosphate has been determined at 2.8 Å resolution. Analysis of these structures suggests that the generation of isoprene from substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate occurs via a syn-periplanar elimination mechanism in which the diphosphate-leaving group serves as a general base. This chemical mechanism is responsible for the annual atmospheric emission of 100 Tg of isoprene by terrestrial plant life. Importantly, the PcISPS structure promises to guide future protein engineering studies, potentially leading to hydrocarbon fuels and products that do not rely on traditional petrochemical sources.</p>

<p>Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) belonging to three nonhomologous classes (II, III, and IV) have been structurally characterized, enabling a comparison of the mechanisms of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate biosynthesis. We report the crystal structures of three active-site complexes for Yersinia pestis class IV AC (AC-IV)-two with substrate analogs and one with product. Mn(2+) binds to all three phosphates, and to Glu12 and Glu136. Electropositive residues Lys14, Arg63, Lys76, Lys111, and Arg113 also form hydrogen bonds to phosphates. The conformation of the analogs is suitable for in-line nucleophilic attack by the ribose O3' on α-phosphate (distance ∼4 Å). In the product complex, a second Mn ion is observed to be coordinated to both ribose 2' oxygen and ribose 3' oxygen. Observation of both metal sites, together with kinetic measurements, provides strong support for a two-cation mechanism. Eleven active-site mutants were also made and kinetically characterized. These findings and comparisons with class II and class III enzymes enable a detailed transphyletic analysis of the AC mechanism. Consistent with its lack of coordination to purine, Y. pestis AC-IV cyclizes both ATP and GTP. As in other classes of AC, the ribose is loosely bound, and as in class III, no base appears to ionize the O3' nucleophile. Different syn/anti conformations suggest that the mechanism involves a conformational transition, and further evidence suggests a role for ribosyl pseudorotation. With resolutions of 1.6-1.7 Å, these are the most detailed active-site ligand complexes for any class of this ubiquitous signaling enzyme.</p>

<p>In order to produce a more potent replacement for trimethoprim (TMP) used as a therapy for Pneumocystis pneumonia and targets dihydrofolate reductase from Pneumocystis jirovecii (pjDHFR), it is necessary to understand the determinants of potency and selectivity against DHFR from the mammalian host and fungal pathogen cells. To this end, active site residues in human (h) DHFR were replaced with those from pjDHFR. Structural data are reported for two complexes of TMP with the double mutants Gln35Ser/Asn64Phe (Q35S/N64F) and Gln35Lys/Asn64Phe (Q35K/N64F) of hDHFR that unexpectedly show evidence for the binding of two molecules of TMP: one molecule that binds in the normal folate binding site and the second molecule that binds in a novel subpocket site such that the mutated residue Phe64 is involved in van der Waals contacts to the trimethoxyphenyl ring of the second TMP molecule. Kinetic data for the binding of TMP to hDHFR and pjDHFR reveal an 84-fold selectivity of TMP against pjDHFR (K(i) 49 nM) compared to hDHFR (K(i) 4093 nM). Two mutants that contain one substitution from pj--and one from the closely related Pneumocystis carinii DHFR (pcDHFR) (Q35K/N64F and Q35S/N64F) show K(i) values of 593 and 617 nM, respectively; these K(i) values are well above both the K(i) for pjDHFR and are similar to pcDHFR (Q35K/N64F and Q35S/N64F) (305nM). These results suggest that active site residues 35 and 64 play key roles in determining selectivity for pneumocystis DHFR, but that other residues contribute to the unique binding of inhibitors to these enzymes.</p>

<p>γ-Butyrobetaine hydroxylase (BBOX) catalyzes the conversion of gamma butyrobetaine (GBB) to l-carnitine, which is involved in the generation of metabolic energy from long-chain fatty acids. BBOX inhibitor 3-(1,1,1-trimethylhydrazin-1-ium-2-yl)propanoate (mildronate), which is an approved, clinically used cardioprotective drug, is a relatively poor BBOX inhibitor and requires high daily doses. In this paper we describe the design, synthesis, and properties of 51 compounds, which include both GBB and mildronate analogues. We have discovered novel BBOX inhibitors with improved IC50 values; the best examples are in the nanomolar range and about 2 orders of magnitude better when compared to mildronate. For six inhibitors, crystal structures in complex with BBOX have been solved to explain their activities and pave the way for further inhibitor design. </p>

<p>Despite its relatively low pH and temperature optimum, the xylanase from Penicillium simplicissimum performs exceedingly well under conditions of paper bleaching. We have purified and characterized this enzyme, which belongs to family 10 of glycosyl hydrolases. Its gene was cloned, and the sequence of the protein was deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The xylanase was crystallized from ammonium sulfate at pH 8.4, and X-ray data were collected at cryo-temperature to a crystallographic resolution of 1.75 A. The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement using the catalytic domain of the Clostridium thermocellum xylanase as a search model, and refined to a residual of R = 20% (R(free) = 23%) for data between 10 and 1.75 A. The xylanase folds in an (alpha/beta)8 barrel (TIM-barrel), with additional helices and loops arranged at the "top" forming the active site cleft. In its overall shape, the P. simplicissimum xylanase structure is similar to other family 10 xylanases, but its active site cleft is much shallower and wider. This probably accounts for the differences in catalysis and in the mode of action of this enzyme. Three glycerol molecules were observed to bind within the active site groove, one of which interacts directly with the catalytic glutamate residues. It appears that they occupy putative xylose binding subsites.</p>

<p>Bioassay-guided fractionation of a CH2Cl2/MeOH extract of the sponge Suberea clavata using the serine protease factor XIa to detect antithrombotic activity led to the isolation of the new marine natural products, clavatadines A and B. Clavatadines A and B inhibited factor XIa with IC50's of 1.3 and 27 microM, respectively. A crystal structure of protein-inhibitor (clavatadine A) complex was obtained and revealed interesting selective binding and irreversible inhibition of factor XIa. The cocrystal structure provides guidance for the design and synthesis of future factor XIa inhibitors as antithrombotic agents.</p>

<p>Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) modulates the cytotoxic effects of thiopurine prodrugs such as 6-mercaptopurine by methylating them in a reaction using S-adenosyl- l-methionine as the donor. Patients with TPMT variant allozymes exhibit diminished levels of protein and/or enzyme activity and are at risk for thiopurine drug-induced toxicity. We have determined two crystal structures of murine TPMT, as a binary complex with the product S-adenosyl- l-homocysteine and as a ternary complex with S-adenosyl- l-homocysteine and the substrate 6-mercaptopurine, to 1.8 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively. Comparison of the structures reveals that an active site loop becomes ordered upon 6-mercaptopurine binding. The positions of the two ligands are consistent with the expected S N2 reaction mechanism. Arg147 and Arg221, the only polar amino acids near 6-mercaptopurine, are highlighted as possible participants in substrate deprotonation. To probe whether these residues are important for catalysis, point mutants were prepared in the human enzyme. Substitution of Arg152 (Arg147 in murine TPMT) with glutamic acid decreases V max and increases K m for 6-mercaptopurine but not K m for S-adenosyl- l-methionine. Substitution at this position with alanine or histidine and similar substitutions of Arg226 (Arg221 in murine TPMT) result in no effect on enzyme activity. The double mutant Arg152Ala/Arg226Ala exhibits a decreased V max and increased K m for 6-mercaptopurine. These observations suggest that either Arg152 or Arg226 may participate in some fashion in the TPMT reaction, with one residue compensating when the other is altered, and that Arg152 may interact with substrate more directly than Arg226, consistent with observations in the murine TPMT crystal structure.</p>

<p>Acetoacetate decarboxylase (AADase) has long been cited as the prototypical example of the marked shifts in the pK(a) values of ionizable groups that can occur in an enzyme active site. In 1966, it was hypothesized that in AADase the origin of the large pK(a) perturbation (-4.5 log units) observed in the nucleophilic Lys 115 results from the proximity of Lys 116, marking the first proposal of microenvironment effects in enzymology. The electrostatic perturbation hypothesis has been demonstrated in a number of enzymes, but never for the enzyme that inspired its conception, owing to the lack of a three-dimensional structure. Here we present the X-ray crystal structures of AADase and of the enamine adduct with the substrate analogue 2,4-pentanedione. Surprisingly, the shift of the pK(a) of Lys 115 is not due to the proximity of Lys 116, the side chain of which is oriented away from the active site. Instead, Lys 116 participates in the structural anchoring of Lys 115 in a long, hydrophobic funnel provided by the novel fold of the enzyme. Thus, AADase perturbs the pK(a) of the nucleophile by means of a desolvation effect by placement of the side chain into the protein core while enforcing the proximity of polar residues, which facilitate decarboxylation through electrostatic and steric effects.</p>

<p>The enzymatic degradation of plant polysaccharides is emerging as one of the key environmental goals of the early 21st century, impacting on many processes in the textile and detergent industries as well as biomass conversion to biofuels. One of the well known problems with the use of nonstarch (nonfood)-based substrates such as the plant cell wall is that the cellulose fibers are embedded in a network of diverse polysaccharides, including xyloglucan, that renders access difficult. There is therefore increasing interest in the "accessory enzymes," including xyloglucanases, that may aid biomass degradation through removal of "hemicellulose" polysaccharides. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the endo-β-1,4-(xylo)glucan hydrolase from Paenibacillus polymyxa with polymeric, oligomeric, and defined chromogenic aryl-oligosaccharide substrates. The enzyme displays an unusual specificity on defined xyloglucan oligosaccharides, cleaving the XXXG-XXXG repeat into XXX and GXXXG. Kinetic analysis on defined oligosaccharides and on aryl-glycosides suggests that both the -4 and +1 subsites show discrimination against xylose-appended glucosides. The three-dimensional structures of PpXG44 have been solved both in apo-form and as a series of ligand complexes that map the -3 to -1 and +1 to +5 subsites of the extended ligand binding cleft. Complex structures are consistent with partial intolerance of xylosides in the -4' subsites. The atypical specificity of PpXG44 may thus find use in industrial processes involving xyloglucan degradation, such as biomass conversion, or in the emerging exciting applications of defined xyloglucans in food, pharmaceuticals, and cellulose fiber modification.</p>

<p>Sialic acids are essential components of membrane glycoconjugates. They are responsible for the interaction, structure, and functionality of all deuterostome cells and have major functions in cellular processes in health and diseases. The key enzyme of the biosynthesis of sialic acid is the bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase that transforms UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) followed by its phosphorylation to ManNAc 6-phosphate and has a direct impact on the sialylation of cell surface components. Here, we present the crystal structures of the human N-acetylmannosamine kinase (MNK) domain of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase in complexes with ManNAc at 1.64 Å resolution, MNK·ManNAc·ADP (1.82 Å) and MNK·ManNAc 6-phosphate · ADP (2.10 Å). Our findings offer detailed insights in the active center of MNK and serve as a structural basis to design inhibitors. We synthesized a novel inhibitor, 6-O-acetyl-ManNAc, which is more potent than those previously tested. Specific inhibitors of sialic acid biosynthesis may serve to further study biological functions of sialic acid.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible oxidation of carbon monoxide by reaction with water to yield carbon dioxide, two protons, and two electrons. Two principal types of CODHs can be distinguished. Ni,Fe-containing CODHs contain a [NiFe(4)S(4)OH(x)] cluster within their active site, to which the direct binding of the substrates water and carbon dioxide has been revealed by protein X-ray crystallography. n-Butyl isocyanide is a slow-turnover substrate of CODHs, whose oxidation at the active site shows several parallels to the oxidation of carbon monoxide. Here, we report the crystal structure of CODH-II from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans resulting from the enzymatic oxidation of n-butyl isocyanide to n-butyl isocyanate at its active site cluster. The high resolution of the structure (d(min) = 1.28 Å) revealed n-butyl isocyanate bound to the active site cluster and identified a novel type of Ni-C bond in CODHs. The structure suggests the occurrence of tetrahedral in addition to square-planar nickel complexes in product-bound states of this enzyme. Furthermore, we discovered a molecule of n-butyl isocyanide in a hydrophobic channel leading to the active site, revealing a unique architecture for the substrate channel of CODH-II compared with the bifunctional CODHs.</p>

<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to hydrogen carbonate, and its role in maintaining pH balance has made it an attractive drug target. Steroidal sulfamate esters, inhibitors of the cancer drug target steroid sulfatase (STS), are sequestered in vivo by CA II in red blood cells, which may be the origin of their excellent drug properties. Understanding the structural basis of this is important for drug design. Structures of CA II complexed with 2-methoxyestradiol 3-O-sulfamate (3), 2-ethylestradiol 3,17-O,O-bis(sulfamate) (4), and 2-methoxyestradiol 17-O-sulfamate (5) are reported to 2.10, 1.85, and 1.64 A, respectively. Inhibitor 3 interacts with the active site Zn(II) ion through the 3-O-sulfamate, while inhibitors 4 and 5 bind through their 17-O-sulfamate. Comparison of the IC(50) values for CA II inhibition gave respective values of 56, 662, 2113, 169, 770, and 86 nM for estrone 3-O-sulfamate (1), 2-methoxyestradiol 3,17-O,O-bis(sulfamate) (2), 3, 4, 5, and 5'-((4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-3-chloro-2'-cyanobiphenyl-4-yl sulfamate (6), a nonsteroidal dual aromatase-sulfatase inhibitor. Inhibitors 2, 5, and 6 showed binding to a second adjacent site that is capable of binding both steroidal and nonsteroidal ligands. Examination of both IC(50) values and crystal structures suggests that 2-substituents on the steroid nucleus hinder binding via a 3-O-sulfamate, leading to coordination through a 17-O-sulfamate if present. These results underline the influence of small structural changes on affinity and mode of binding, the degree of flexibility in the design of sulfamate-based inhibitors, and suggest a strategy for inhibitors which interact with both the active site and the second adjacent binding site simultaneously that could be both potent and selective.</p>

<p>Ornithine cyclodeaminase catalyzes the conversion of L-ornithine to L-proline by an NAD(+)-dependent hydride transfer reaction that culminates in ammonia elimination. Phylogenetic comparisons of amino acid sequences revealed that the enzyme belongs to the mu-crystallin protein family whose three-dimensional fold has not been reported. Here we describe the crystal structure of ornithine cyclodeaminase in complex with NADH, refined to 1.80 A resolution. The enzyme consists of a homodimeric fold whose subunits comprise two functional regions: (i) a novel substrate-binding domain whose antiparallel beta-strands form a 14-stranded barrel at the oligomeric interface and (ii) a canonical Rossmann fold that interacts with a single dinucleotide positioned for re hydride transfer. The adenosyl moiety of the cofactor resides in a solvent-exposed crevice on the protein surface and makes contact with a "domain-swapped"-like coil-helix module originating from the dyad-related molecule. Diffraction data were also collected to 1.60 A resolution on crystals grown in the presence of l-ornithine. The structure revealed that the substrate carboxyl group interacts with the side chains of Arg45, Lys69, and Arg112. In addition, the ammonia leaving group hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Asp228 and the site of hydride transfer is 3.8 A from C4 of the nicotinamide. The absence of an appropriately positioned water suggested that a previously proposed mechanism that calls for hydrolytic elimination of the imino intermediate must be reconsidered. A more parsimonious description of the chemical mechanism is proposed and discussed in relation to the structure and function of mu-crystallins.</p>

<p>The most frequent lesion in DNA is at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites resulting from DNA-base losses. These AP-site lesions can stall DNA replication and lead to genome instability if left unrepaired. The AP endonucleases are an important class of enzymes that are involved in the repair of AP-site intermediates during damage-general DNA base-excision repair pathways. These enzymes hydrolytically cleave the 5'-phosphodiester bond at an AP site to generate a free 3'-hydroxyl group and a 5'-terminal sugar phosphate using their AP nuclease activity. Specifically, Thermotoga maritima endonuclease IV is a member of the second conserved AP endonuclease family that includes Escherichia coli endonuclease IV, which is the archetype of the AP endonuclease superfamily. In order to more fully characterize the AP endonuclease family of enzymes, two X-ray crystal structures of the T. maritima endonuclease IV homologue were determined in the presence of divalent metal ions bound in the active-site region. These structures of the T. maritima endonuclease IV homologue further revealed the use of the TIM-barrel fold and the trinuclear metal binding site as important highly conserved structural elements that are involved in DNA-binding and AP-site repair processes in the AP endonuclease superfamily.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress is a principal cause of DNA damage, and mechanisms to repair this damage are among the most highly conserved of biological processes. Oxidative stress is also used by phagocytes to attack bacterial pathogens in defence of the host. We have identified and characterised two apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease paralogues in the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. The presence of multiple versions of DNA repair enzymes in a single organism is usually thought to reflect redundancy in activities that are essential for cellular viability. We demonstrate here that these two AP endonuclease paralogues have distinct activities in DNA repair: one is a typical Neisserial AP endonuclease (NApe), whereas the other is a specialised 3'-phosphodiesterase Neisserial exonuclease (NExo). The lack of AP endonuclease activity of NExo is shown to be attributable to the presence of a histidine side chain, blocking the abasic ribose-binding site. Both enzymes are necessary for survival of N. meningitidis under oxidative stress and during bloodstream infection. The novel functional pairing of NExo and NApe is widespread among bacteria and appears to have evolved independently on several occasions.</p>

<p>The enzymatic digestion of cellulose entails intimate involvement of cellobiohydrolases, whose characteristic active-center tunnel contributes to a processive degradation of the polysaccharide. The cellobiohydrolase Cel6A displays an active site within a tunnel formed by two extended loops, which are known to open and close in response to ligand binding. Here we present five structures of wild-type and mutant forms of Cel6A from Humicola insolens in complex with nonhydrolyzable thio-oligosaccharides, at resolutions from 1.7-1.1 A, dissecting the structural accommodation of a processing substrate chain through the active center during hydrolysis. Movement of ligand is facilitated by extensive solvent-mediated interactions and through flexibility in the hydrophobic surfaces provided by a sheath of tryptophan residues.</p>

<p>The e (P4) phosphatase from Haemophilus influenzae functions in a vestigial NAD(+) utilization pathway by dephosphorylating nicotinamide mononucleotide to nicotinamide riboside. P4 is also the prototype of class C acid phosphatases (CCAPs), which are nonspecific 5',3'-nucleotidases localized to the bacterial outer membrane. To understand substrate recognition by P4 and other class C phosphatases, we have determined the crystal structures of a substrate-trapping mutant P4 enzyme complexed with nicotinamide mononucleotide, 5'-AMP, 3'-AMP, and 2'-AMP. The structures reveal an anchor-shaped substrate-binding cavity comprising a conserved hydrophobic box that clamps the nucleotide base, a buried phosphoryl binding site, and three solvent-filled pockets that contact the ribose and the hydrogen-bonding edge of the base. The span between the hydrophobic box and the phosphoryl site is optimal for recognizing nucleoside monophosphates, explaining the general preference for this class of substrate. The base makes no hydrogen bonds with the enzyme, consistent with an observed lack of base specificity. Two solvent-filled pockets flanking the ribose are key to the dual recognition of 5'-nucleotides and 3'-nucleotides. These pockets minimize the enzyme's direct interactions with the ribose and provide sufficient space to accommodate 5' substrates in an anti conformation and 3' substrates in a syn conformation. Finally, the structures suggest that class B acid phosphatases and CCAPs share a common strategy for nucleotide recognition.</p>

<p>Glycosidases are some of the most ubiquitous enzyme in nature. Their biological significance, coupled to their enormous catalytic prowess derived from tight binding of the transition state, is reflected in their importance as therapeutic targets. Many glycosidase inhibitors are known. Imino sugars are often potent inhibitors, yet many facets of their mode of action, such as their degree, if any, of transition-state "mimicry" and their protonation state when bound to the target glycosidase remain unclear. Atomic resolution analysis of the endoglucanase, Cel5A, in complex with a cellobio-derived isofagomine in conjunction with the pH dependence of Ki and kcat/KM reveals that this compound binds as a protonated sugar. Surprisingly, both the enzymatic nucleophile and the acid/base are unprotonated in the complex.</p>

<p>DNA is susceptible to alkylation damage by a number of environmental agents that modify the Watson-Crick edge of the bases. Such lesions, if not repaired, may be bypassed by Y-family DNA polymerases. The bypass polymerase Dpo4 is strongly inhibited by 1-methylguanine (m1G) and 3-methylcytosine (m3C), with nucleotide incorporation opposite these lesions being predominantly mutagenic. Further, extension after insertion of both correct and incorrect bases, introduces additional base substitution and deletion errors. Crystal structures of the Dpo4 ternary extension complexes with correct and mismatched 3'-terminal primer bases opposite the lesions reveal that both m1G and m3C remain positioned within the DNA template/primer helix. However, both correct and incorrect pairing partners exhibit pronounced primer terminal nucleotide distortion, being primarily evicted from the DNA helix when opposite m1G or misaligned when pairing with m3C. Our studies provide insights into mechanisms related to hindered and mutagenic bypass of methylated lesions and models associated with damage recognition by repair demethylases.</p>

<p>1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) is a novel target for developing new antibacterial (including antituberculosis) and antimalaria drugs. Forty-one lipophilic phosphonates, representing a new class of DXR inhibitors, were synthesized, among which 5-phenylpyridin-2-ylmethylphosphonic acid possesses the most activity against E. coli DXR (EcDXR) with a K(i) of 420 nM. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) are discussed, which can be rationalized using our EcDXR:inhibitor structures, and a predictive quantitative SAR (QSAR) model is also developed. Since inhibition studies of DXR from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtDXR) have not been performed well, 48 EcDXR inhibitors with a broad chemical diversity were found, however, to generally exhibit considerably reduced activity against MtDXR. The crystal structure of a MtDXR:inhibitor complex reveals the flexible loop containing the residues 198-208 has no strong interactions with the 3,4-dichlorophenyl group of the inhibitor, representing a structural basis for the reduced activity. Overall, these results provide implications in the future design and development of potent DXR inhibitors.</p>

<p>Molecular docking computationally screens thousands to millions of organic molecules against protein structures, looking for those with complementary fits. Many approximations are made, often resulting in low "hit rates." A strategy to overcome these approximations is to rescore top-ranked docked molecules using a better but slower method. One such is afforded by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) techniques. These more physically realistic methods have improved models for solvation and electrostatic interactions and conformational change compared to most docking programs. To investigate MM-GBSA rescoring, we re-ranked docking hit lists in three small buried sites: a hydrophobic cavity that binds apolar ligands, a slightly polar cavity that binds aryl and hydrogen-bonding ligands, and an anionic cavity that binds cationic ligands. These sites are simple; consequently, incorrect predictions can be attributed to particular errors in the method, and many likely ligands may actually be tested. In retrospective calculations, MM-GBSA techniques with binding-site minimization better distinguished the known ligands for each cavity from the known decoys compared to the docking calculation alone. This encouraged us to test rescoring prospectively on molecules that ranked poorly by docking but that ranked well when rescored by MM-GBSA. A total of 33 molecules highly ranked by MM-GBSA for the three cavities were tested experimentally. Of these, 23 were observed to bind--these are docking false negatives rescued by rescoring. The 10 remaining molecules are true negatives by docking and false positives by MM-GBSA. X-ray crystal structures were determined for 21 of these 23 molecules. In many cases, the geometry prediction by MM-GBSA improved the initial docking pose and more closely resembled the crystallographic result; yet in several cases, the rescored geometry failed to capture large conformational changes in the protein. Intriguingly, rescoring not only rescued docking false positives, but also introduced several new false positives into the top-ranking molecules. We consider the origins of the successes and failures in MM-GBSA rescoring in these model cavity sites and the prospects for rescoring in biologically relevant targets.</p>

<p>Structure-based design (SBD) can be used for the design and/or optimization of new inhibitors for a biological target. Whereas de novo SBD is rarely used, most reports on SBD are dealing with the optimization of an initial hit. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) has emerged as a powerful strategy to identify bioactive ligands given that it enables the target to direct the synthesis of its strongest binder. We have designed a library of potential inhibitors (acylhydrazones) generated from five aldehydes and five hydrazides and used DCC to identify the best binder(s). After addition of the aspartic protease endothiapepsin, we characterized the protein-bound library member(s) by saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. Cocrystallization experiments validated the predicted binding mode of the two most potent inhibitors, thus demonstrating that the combination of de novo SBD and DCC constitutes an efficient starting point for hit identification and optimization. </p>

<p>The enzyme Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase (aka P5CDH and ALDH4A1) is an aldehyde dehydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidation of γ-glutamate semialdehyde to l-glutamate. The crystal structures of mouse P5CDH complexed with glutarate, succinate, malonate, glyoxylate, and acetate are reported. The structures are used to build a structure-activity relationship that describes the semialdehyde carbon chain length and the position of the aldehyde group in relation to the cysteine nucleophile and oxyanion hole. Efficient 4- and 5-carbon substrates share the common feature of being long enough to span the distance between the anchor loop at the bottom of the active site and the oxyanion hole at the top of the active site. The inactive 2- and 3-carbon semialdehydes bind the anchor loop but are too short to reach the oxyanion hole. Inhibition of P5CDH by glyoxylate, malonate, succinate, glutarate, and l-glutamate is also examined. The Ki values are 0.27 mM for glyoxylate, 58 mM for succinate, 30 mM for glutarate, and 12 mM for l-glutamate. Curiously, malonate is not an inhibitor. The trends in Ki likely reflect a trade-off between the penalty for desolvating the carboxylates of the free inhibitor and the number of compensating hydrogen bonds formed in the enzyme-inhibitor complex.</p>

<p>Cryocooled crystals of a mercury complex of Escherichia coli dUTPase diffract to atomic resolution. Data to 1.05 A resolution were collected from a derivative crystal and the structure model was derived from a Fourier map with phases calculated from the coordinates of the Hg atom (one site per subunit of the trimeric enzyme) using the program ARP/wARP. After refinement with anisotropic temperature factors a highly accurate model of the bacterial dUTPase was obtained. Data to 1.45 A from a native crystal were also collected and the 100 K structures were compared. Inspection of the refined models reveals that a large part of the dUTPase remains rather mobile upon freezing, with 14% of the main chain being totally disordered and with numerous side chains containing disordered atoms in multiple discrete conformations. A large number of those residues surround the active-site cavity. Two glycerol molecules (the cryosolvent) occupy the deoxyribose-binding site. Comparison between the native enzyme and the mercury complex shows that the active site is not adversely affected by the binding of mercury. An unexpected effect seems to be a stabilization of the crystal lattice by means of long-range interactions, making derivatization a potentially useful tool for further studies of inhibitor-substrate-analogue complexes of this protein at very high resolution.</p>

<p>DNA topoisomerases are the enzymes responsible for controlling and maintaining the topological states of DNA. Type IA enzymes work by transiently breaking the phosphodiester backbone of one strand to allow passage of another strand through the break. The protein has to perform complex rearrangements of the DNA, and hence it is likely that different regions of the enzyme bind DNA with different affinities. In order to identify some of the DNA binding sites in the protein, we have solved the structures of several complexes of the 67 kDa N-terminal fragment of Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I with mono- and trinucleotides. There are five different binding sites in the complexes, one of which is adjacent to the active site. Two other sites are in the central hole of the protein and may represent general DNA binding regions. The positions of these sites allow us to identify different DNA binding regions and to understand their possible roles in the catalytic cycle.</p>

<p>Cryptophanes represent an exciting class of xenon-encapsulating molecules that can be exploited as probes for nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. The 1.70 A resolution crystal structure of a cryptophane-derivatized benezenesulfonamide complexed with human carbonic anhydrase II shows how an encapsulated xenon atom can be directed to a specific biological target. The crystal structure confirms binding measurements indicating that the cryptophane cage does not strongly interact with the surface of the protein, which may enhance the sensitivity of 129Xe NMR spectroscopic measurements in solution.</p>

<p>Xenobiotic reductase A (XenA) from Pseudomonas putida 86 catalyzes the NADH/NADPH-dependent reduction of various substrates, including 2-cyclohexenone and 8-hydroxycoumarin. XenA is a member of the old yellow enzyme (OYE) family of flavoproteins and is structurally and functionally similar to other bacterial members of this enzyme class. A characteristic feature of XenA is the presence of a cysteine residue (Cys25) in the active site, where in most members of the OYE family a threonine residue is found that modulates the reduction potential of the FMN/FMNH(-) couple. We investigated the role of Cys25 by studying two variants in which the residue has been exchanged for a serine and an alanine residue. While the exchange against alanine has a remarkably small effect on the reduction potential, the reactivity and the structure of XenA, the exchange against serine increases the reduction potential by +82 mV, increases the rate constant of the reductive half-reaction and decreases the rate constant in the oxidative half-reaction. We determined six crystal structures at high to true atomic resolution (d(min) 1.03-1.80 A) of the three XenA variants with and without the substrate coumarin bound in the active site. The atomic resolution structure of XenA in complex with coumarin reveals a compressed active site geometry in which the isoalloxazine ring is sandwiched between coumarin and the protein backbone. The structures further reveal that the conformation of the active site and substrate interactions are preserved in the two variants, indicating that the observed changes are due to local effects only. We propose that Cys25 and the residues in its place determine which of the two half-reactions is rate limiting, depending on the substrate couple. This might help to explain why the genome of Pseudomonas putida encodes multiple xenobiotic reductases containing either cysteine, threonine or alanine in the active site.</p>

We determined six crystal structures at high to true atomic resolution (d(min) 1.03-1.80 A) of the three XenA variants with and without the substrate coumarin bound in the active site. The atomic resolution structure of XenA in complex with coumarin reveals a compressed active site geometry in which the isoalloxazine ring is sandwiched between coumarin and the protein backbone. The structures further reveal that the conformation of the active site and substrate interactions are preserved in the two variants, indicating that the observed changes are due to local effects only. We propose that Cys25 and the residues in its place determine which of the two half-reactions is rate limiting, depending on the substrate couple. This might help to explain why the genome of Pseudomonas putida encodes multiple xenobiotic reductases containing either cysteine, threonine or alanine in the active site.</p>

<p>In the course of a fragment screening campaign by in silico docking followed by X-ray crystallography, a novel binding site for migration inhibitory factor (MIF) inhibitors was demonstrated. The site is formed by rotation of the side-chain of Tyr-36 to reveal a surface binding site in MIF that is hydrophobic and surrounded by aromatic side-chain residues. The crystal structures of two small inhibitors that bind to this site and of a quinolinone inhibitor, that spans the canonical deep pocket near Pro-1 and the new surface binding site, have been solved. These results suggest new opportunities for structure-based design of MIF inhibitors.</p>

<p>Sucrose transport is the central system for the allocation of carbon resources in vascular plants. During growth and development, plants control carbon distribution by coordinating sites of sucrose synthesis and cleavage in different plant organs and different cellular locations. Sucrose synthase, which reversibly catalyzes sucrose synthesis and cleavage, provides a direct and reversible means to regulate sucrose flux. Depending on the metabolic environment, sucrose synthase alters its cellular location to participate in cellulose, callose, and starch biosynthesis through its interactions with membranes, organelles, and cytoskeletal actin. The x-ray crystal structure of sucrose synthase isoform 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSus1) has been determined as a complex with UDP-glucose and as a complex with UDP and fructose, at 2.8- and 2.85-Å resolutions, respectively. The AtSus1 structure provides insights into sucrose catalysis and cleavage, as well as the regulation of sucrose synthase and its interactions with cellular targets.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the human Pg-derived angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin, complexed to VEK-30, a peptide from the group A streptococcal surface protein, PAM, was determined and refined to 2.3 A resolution. This is the first structure of angiostatin bound to a ligand and provides a model of the interaction between Pg and streptococcal-derived pathogenic proteins. VEK-30 contains a "through-space isostere" for C-terminal lysine, wherein Arg and Glu side chains, separated by one helical turn, bind within the bipolar angiostatin kringle 2 (K2) domain lysine-binding site. VEK-30 also makes several contacts with K2 residues that exist outside of the canonical LBS and are not conserved among the other Pg kringles, thus providing a molecular basis for the selectivity of VEK-30 for K2. The structure also shows that Pg kringle domains undergo significant structural rearrangement relative to one another and reveals dimerization between two molecules of angiostatin and VEK-30 related by crystallographic symmetry. This dimerization, which exists only in the crystal structure, is consistent with the parallel coiled-coil full-length PAM dimer expected from sequence similarities and homology modeling.</p>

<p>Most fungi and bacteria degrade plant cell walls by secreting free, complementary enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose; however, some bacteria use large enzymatic assemblies called cellulosomes, which recruit complementary enzymes to protein scaffolds. The thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii uses an intermediate strategy, secreting many free cellulases that contain multiple catalytic domains. One of these, CelA, comprises a glycoside hydrolase family 9 and a family 48 catalytic domain, as well as three type III cellulose-binding modules. In the saccharification of a common cellulose standard, Avicel, CelA outperforms mixtures of commercially relevant exo- and endoglucanases. From transmission electron microscopy studies of cellulose after incubation with CelA, we report morphological features that suggest that CelA not only exploits the common surface ablation mechanism driven by general cellulase processivity, but also excavates extensive cavities into the surface of the substrate. These results suggest that nature's repertoire of cellulose digestion paradigms remain only partially discovered and understood. </p>

<p>The first crystal structures of lipases that have been covalently modified through site-selective inhibition by different organometallic phosphonate-pincer-metal complexes are described. Two ECE-pincer-type d(8)-metal complexes, that is, platinum (1) or palladium (2) with phosphonate esters (ECE = [(EtO)-(O=)P(-O-C(6)H(4)-(NO(2))-4)(-C(3)H(6)-4-(C(6)H(2)-(CH(2)E)(2))](-); E = NMe(2) or SMe) were introduced prior to crystallization and have been shown to bind selectively to the Ser(120) residue in the active site of the lipase cutinase to give cut-1 (platinum) or cut-2 (palladium) hybrids. For all five presented crystal structures, the ECE-pincer-platinum or -palladium head group sticks out of the cutinase molecule and is exposed to the solvent. Depending on the nature of the ECE-pincer-metal head group, the ECE-pincer-platinum and -palladium guests occupy different pockets in the active site of cutinase, with concomitant different stereochemistries on the phosphorous atom for the cut-1 (S(P)) and cut-2 (R(P)) structures. When cut-1 was crystallized under halide-poor conditions, a novel metal-induced dimeric structure was formed between two cutinase-bound pincer-platinum head groups, which are interconnected through a single mu-Cl bridge. This halide-bridged metal dimer shows that coordination chemistry is possible with protein-modified pincer-metal complexes. Furthermore, we could use NCN-pincer-platinum complex 1 as site-selective tool for the phasing of raw protein diffraction data, which shows the potential use of pincer-platinum complex 1 as a heavy-atom derivative in protein crystallography.</p>

<p>Melanocarpus albomyces laccase crystals were soaked with 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, a common laccase substrate. Three complex structures from different soaking times were solved. Crystal structures revealed the binding of the original substrate and adducts formed by enzymatic oxidation of the substrate. The dimeric oxidation products were identified by mass spectrometry. In the crystals, a 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone and a C-O dimer were observed, whereas a C-C dimer was the main product identified by mass spectrometry. Crystal structures demonstrated that the substrate and/or its oxidation products were bound in the pocket formed by residues Ala191, Pro192, Glu235, Leu363, Phe371, Trp373, Phe427, Leu429, Trp507 and His508. Substrate and adducts were hydrogen-bonded to His508, one of the ligands of type 1 copper. Therefore, this surface-exposed histidine most likely has a role in electron transfer by laccases. Based on our mutagenesis studies, the carboxylic acid residue Glu235 at the bottom of the binding site pocket is also crucial in the oxidation of phenolics. Glu235 may be responsible for the abstraction of a proton from the OH group of the substrate and His508 may extract an electron. In addition, crystal structures revealed a secondary binding site formed through weak dimerization in M. albomyces laccase molecules. This binding site most likely exists only in crystals, when the Phe427 residues are packed against each other.</p>

<p>Currently, the cost of cellulase enzymes remains a key economic impediment to commercialization of biofuels. Enzymes from glycoside hydrolase family 48 (GH48) are a critical component of numerous natural lignocellulose-degrading systems. Although computational mining of large genomic data sets is a promising new approach for identifying novel cellulolytic activities, current computational methods are unable to distinguish between cellulases and enzymes with different substrate specificities that belong to the same protein family. We show that by using a robust computational approach supported by experimental studies, cellulases and non-cellulases can be effectively identified within a given protein family. Phylogenetic analysis of GH48 showed non-monophyletic distribution, an indication of horizontal gene transfer. Enzymatic function of GH48 proteins coded by horizontally transferred genes was verified experimentally, which confirmed that these proteins are cellulases. Computational and structural studies of GH48 enzymes identified structural elements that define cellulases and can be used to computationally distinguish them from non-cellulases. We propose that the structural element that can be used for in silico discrimination between cellulases and non-cellulases belonging to GH48 is an ω-loop located on the surface of the molecule and characterized by highly conserved rare amino acids. These markers were used to screen metagenomics data for "true" cellulases.</p>

<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3-4A protease is essential for viral replication. All current small molecular weight drugs against NS3-4A are substrate peptidomimetics that have a similar binding and resistance profile. We developed inhibitory peptides (IPs) capping the active site and binding via a novel "tyrosine" finger at an alternative NS3-4A site that is of particular interest for further HCV drug development. The peptides are not cleaved due to a combination of geometrical constraints and impairment of the oxyanion hole function. Selection and optimization through combinatorial phagemid display, protein crystallography, and further modifications resulted in a 32-amino acid peptide with a K(i) of 0.53 nm. Inhibition of viral replication in cell culture was demonstrated by fusion to a cell-penetrating peptide. Negligible susceptibility to known (A156V and R155K) resistance mutations of the NS3-4A protease was observed. This work shows for the first time that antiviral peptides can target an intracellular site and reveals a novel druggable site on the HCV protease.</p>

<p>Isopentenyl diphosphate is a precursor of various isoprenoids and is produced by the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids of plants, protozoa and many eubacteria. A key enzyme in the MEP pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), has been shown to be the target of fosmidomycin, which works as an antimalarial, antibacterial and herbicidal compound. In this paper, we report studies of kinetics and the crystal structures of the thermostable DXR from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima. Unlike the mesophilic DXRs, Thermotoga DXR (tDXR) showed activity only with Mg(2+) at its growth temperature. We solved the crystal structures of tDXR with and without fosmidomycin. The structure without fosmidomycin but unexpectedly bound with 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), revealing a new extra space available for potential drug design. This structure adopted the closed form by rigid domain rotation but without the flexible loop over the active site, which was considered as a novel conformation. Further, the conserved Asp residue responsible for cation binding seemed to play an important role in adjusting the position of fosmidomycin. Taken together, our kinetic and the crystal structures illustrate the binding mode of fosmidomycin that leads to its slow, tight binding according to the conformational changes of DXR.</p>

<p>We investigated the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) isoforms I-XV with 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenylsulfamide and other simple or sugar sulfamides, a class of less investigated CA inhibitors (CAIs). The crystal structure of the adduct of hCA II with the boron-substituted sulfamide shows the organic scaffold of this compound bound in the hydrophilic half of the active site where it makes a large number of van der Waals contacts with Ile91, Gln92, Val121, Phe131, Leu198, and Thr200. The data here reported provide further insights into sulfamide binding mechanism confirming that this zinc-binding group could be usefully exploited for obtaining new potent and selective CAIs.</p>

<p>Bicyclic peptides generated through directed evolution by using phage display offer an attractive ligand format for the development of therapeutics. Being nearly 100-fold smaller than antibodies, they promise advantages such as access to chemical synthesis, efficient diffusion into tissues, and needle-free application. However, unlike antibodies, they do not have a folded structure in solution and thus bind less well. We developed bicyclic peptides with hydrophilic chemical structures at their center to promote noncovalent intramolecular interactions, thereby stabilizing the peptide conformation. The sequences of the peptides isolated by phage display from large combinatorial libraries were strongly influenced by the type of small molecule used in the screen, thus suggesting that the peptides fold around the small molecules. X-ray structure analysis revealed that the small molecules indeed formed hydrogen bonds with the peptides. These noncovalent interactions stabilize the peptide-protein complexes and contribute to the high binding affinity. </p>

<p>5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of heme biosynthesis in humans, animals, other non-plant eukaryotes, and alpha-proteobacteria. It catalyzes the synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid, the first common precursor of all tetrapyrroles, from glycine and succinyl-coenzyme A (sCoA) in a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent manner. X-linked sideroblastic anemias (XLSAs), a group of severe disorders in humans characterized by inadequate formation of heme in erythroblast mitochondria, are caused by mutations in the gene for erythroid eALAS, one of two human genes for ALAS. We present the first crystal structure of homodimeric ALAS from Rhodobacter capsulatus (ALAS(Rc)) binding its cofactor PLP. We, furthermore, present structures of ALAS(Rc) in complex with the substrates glycine or sCoA. The sequence identity of ALAS from R. capsulatus and human eALAS is 49%. XLSA-causing mutations may thus be mapped, revealing the molecular basis of XLSA in humans. Mutations are found to obstruct substrate binding, disrupt the dimer interface, or hamper the correct folding. The structure of ALAS completes the structural analysis of enzymes in heme biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Aminopeptidase P (APPro) is a manganese-dependent enzyme that cleaves the N-terminal amino acid from polypeptides where the second residue is proline. APPro shares a similar fold, substrate specificity, and catalytic mechanism with methionine aminopeptidase and prolidase. To investigate the roles of conserved residues at the active site, seven mutant forms of APPro were characterized kinetically and structurally. Mutation of individual metal ligands selectively abolished binding of either or both Mn(II) atoms at the active site, and none of these metal-ligand mutants had detectable catalytic activity. Mutation of the conserved active site residues His243 and His361 revealed that both are required for catalysis. We propose that His243 stabilizes substrate binding through an interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of the requisite proline residue of a substrate and that His361 stabilizes substrate binding and the gem-diol catalytic intermediate. Sequence, structural, and kinetic analyses reveal that His350, conserved in APPro and prolidase but not in methionine aminopeptidase, forms part of a hydrophobic binding pocket that gives APPro its proline specificity. Further, peptides in which the required proline residue is replaced by N-methylalanine or alanine are cleaved by APPro, but they are extremely poor substrates due to a loss of interactions between the prolidyl ring of the substrate and the hydrophobic proline-binding pocket.</p>

<p>Cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKOs) mediate catabolic regulation of cytokinin levels in plants. Several substrate analogs containing an unsaturated side chain were studied for their possible inhibitory effect on maize CKO (ZmCKO1) by use of various bioanalytical methods. Two allenic derivatives, N(6)-(buta-2,3-dienyl)adenine (HA-8) and N(6)-(penta-2,3-dienyl)adenine (HA-1), were identified as strong mechanism-based inhibitors of the enzyme. Despite exhaustive dialysis, the enzyme remained inhibited. Conversely, substrate analogs with a triple bond in the side chain were much weaker inactivators. The crystal structures of recombinant ZmCKO1 complexed with HA-1 or HA-8 were solved to 1.95 A resolution. Together with Raman spectra of the inactivated enzyme, it was revealed that reactive imine intermediates generated by oxidation of the allenic inhibitors covalently bind to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. The binding occurs at the C4a atom of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, the planarity of which is consequently disrupted. All the compounds under study were also analyzed for binding to the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors AHK3 and AHK4 in a bacterial receptor assay and for cytokinin activity in the Amaranthus bioassay. HA-1 and HA-8 were found to be good receptor ligands with a significant cytokinin activity. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inactivate CKO in the desired time intervals or developmental stages, they both represent attractive compounds for physiological studies, as the inhibition mechanism of HA-1 and HA-8 is mainly FAD dependent.</p>

<p>Copper-containing nitrite reductases catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO), a key step in denitrification that results in the loss of terrestrial nitrogen to the atmosphere. They are found in a wide variety of denitrifying bacteria and fungi of different physiology from a range of soil and aquatic ecosystems. Structural analysis of potential intermediates in the catalytic cycle is an important goal in understanding enzyme mechanism. Using "crystal harvesting" and substrate-soaking techniques, we have determined atomic resolution structures of four forms of the green Cu-nitrite reductase, from the soil bacterium Achromobacter cycloclastes. These structures are the resting state of the enzyme at 0.9 A, two species exhibiting different conformations of nitrite bound at the catalytic type 2 Cu, one of which is stable and also has NO present, at 1.10 A and 1.15 A, and a stable form with the product NO bound side-on to the catalytic type 2 Cu, at 1.12 A resolution. These structures provide incisive insights into the initial binding of substrate, its repositioning before catalysis, bond breakage (O-NO), and the formation of a stable NO adduct.</p>

<p>The activity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is important for the maturation of B cells. A variety of point mutations in this enzyme result in a severe human immunodeficiency known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Btk contains a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain that specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and, hence, responds to signalling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Point mutations in the PH domain might abolish membrane binding, preventing signalling via Btk.</p>

<p>Cellulose, a polysaccharide consisting of beta-1,4-linked glucose, is the major component of plant cell walls and consequently one of the most abundant biopolymers on earth. Carbohydrate polymers such as cellulose are molecules with vast diversity in structure and function, and a multiplicity of hydrolases operating in concert are required for depolymerisation. The bacterium Rhodothermus marinus, isolated from shallow water marine hot springs, produces a number of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes including a family 12 cellulase Cel12A. The structure of R.marinus Cel12A in the ligand-free form (at 1.54 angstroms) and structures of RmCel12A after crystals were soaked in cellopentaose for two different lengths of time, have been determined. The shorter soaked complex revealed the conformation of unhydrolysed cellotetraose, while cellopentaose had been degraded more completely during the longer soak. Comparison of these structures with those of mesophilic family 12 cellulases in complex with inhibitors and substrate revealed that RmCel12A has a more extensive aromatic network in the active site cleft which ejects products after hydrolysis. The substrate structure confirms that during hydrolysis by family 12 cellulases glucose does not pass through a (2,5)B conformation. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of RmCel12A showed that the enzyme forms a loosely associated antiparallel dimer in solution, which may target the enzyme to the antiparallel polymer strands in cellulose.</p>

<p>Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), one of the central components of the renin-angiotensin system, is a key therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Human somatic ACE (sACE) has two homologous domains (N and C). The N- and C-domain catalytic sites have different activities toward various substrates. Moreover, some of the undesirable side effects of the currently available and widely used ACE inhibitors may arise from their targeting both domains leading to defects in other pathways. In addition, structural studies have shown that although both these domains have much in common at the inhibitor binding site, there are significant differences and these are greater at the peptide binding sites than regions distal to the active site. As a model system, we have used an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE, a single domain protein with ACE activity) to study ACE inhibitor binding. In an extensive study, we present high-resolution structures for native AnCE and in complex with six known antihypertensive drugs, a novel C-domain sACE specific inhibitor, lisW-S, and two sACE domain-specific phosphinic peptidyl inhibitors, RXPA380 and RXP407 (i.e., nine structures). These structures show detailed binding features of the inhibitors and highlight subtle changes in the orientation of side chains at different binding pockets in the active site in comparison with the active site of N- and C-domains of sACE. This study provides information about the structure-activity relationships that could be utilized for designing new inhibitors with improved domain selectivity for sACE.</p>

<p>Structure determinations of human aldose reductase holoenzyme in complex with the 2S4R-,2R4S- and 2R4R-isomers of the potent inhibitor Fidarestat ((2S,4S)-6-fluoro-2',5'-dioxospiro[chroman-4,4'-imidazoline]-2-carboxamide) were carried out in order to elucidate the binding modes responsible for the differences in their inhibitory potencies. In the complex structure with the 2R4S-isomer the cyclic imide moiety formed hydrogen bonds with the side-chains of Trp111, Tyr48 and His110. In the attempt to determine the complex structure with the least potent 2R4R-isomer this ligand was not observed, and instead, the active site was simultaneously occupied by two citrate molecules (occupancies of 60% and 40%). In the case of 2S4R, the active site was occupied by a citrate molecule which anchors the 2S4R-isomer from its carbamoyl group. The structures of the complexes suggest that the differences in the interactions between the cyclic imide rings and carbamoyl groups of the compounds with residues His110, Trp111, Trp219 and Cys298 account for differences in their inhibitory potencies.</p>

In the case of 2S4R, the active site was occupied by a citrate molecule which anchors the 2S4R-isomer from its carbamoyl group. The structures of the complexes suggest that the differences in the interactions between the cyclic imide rings and carbamoyl groups of the compounds with residues His110, Trp111, Trp219 and Cys298 account for differences in their inhibitory potencies.</p>

<p>Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), one of the central components of the renin-angiotensin system, is a key therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Human somatic ACE (sACE) has two homologous domains (N and C). The N- and C-domain catalytic sites have different activities toward various substrates. Moreover, some of the undesirable side effects of the currently available and widely used ACE inhibitors may arise from their targeting both domains leading to defects in other pathways. In addition, structural studies have shown that although both these domains have much in common at the inhibitor binding site, there are significant differences and these are greater at the peptide binding sites than regions distal to the active site. As a model system, we have used an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE, a single domain protein with ACE activity) to study ACE inhibitor binding. In an extensive study, we present high-resolution structures for native AnCE and in complex with six known antihypertensive drugs, a novel C-domain sACE specific inhibitor, lisW-S, and two sACE domain-specific phosphinic peptidyl inhibitors, RXPA380 and RXP407 (i.e., nine structures). These structures show detailed binding features of the inhibitors and highlight subtle changes in the orientation of side chains at different binding pockets in the active site in comparison with the active site of N- and C-domains of sACE. This study provides information about the structure-activity relationships that could be utilized for designing new inhibitors with improved domain selectivity for sACE.</p>

<p>Pteridine reductase (PTR1) is a potential target for drug development against parasitic Trypanosoma and Leishmania species. These protozoa cause serious diseases for which current therapies are inadequate. High-resolution structures have been determined, using data between 1.6 and 1.1 Å resolution, of T. brucei PTR1 in complex with pemetrexed, trimetrexate, cyromazine and a 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative. The structures provide insight into the interactions formed by new molecular entities in the enzyme active site with ligands that represent lead compounds for structure-based inhibitor development and to support early-stage drug discovery.</p>

<p>Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) are essential enzymes that make them good drug targets in cancer and microbial infections. MetAPs remove the initiator methionine from newly synthesized peptides in every living cell. MetAPs are broadly divided into type I and type II classes. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes contain type I MetAPs, while eukaryotes have additional type II MetAP enzyme. Although several inhibitors have been reported against type I enzymes, subclass specificity is scarce. Here, using the fine differences in the entrance of the active sites of MetAPs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Enterococcus faecalis , and human, three hotspots have been identified and pyridinylpyrimidine-based molecules were selected from a commercial source to target these hotspots. In the biochemical evaluation, many of the 38 compounds displayed differential behavior against these three enzymes. Crystal structures of four selected inhibitors in complex with human MetAP1b and molecular modeling studies provided the basis for the binding specificity.</p>

<p>Aromatic amine dehydrogenase uses a tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor to oxidatively deaminate primary aromatic amines. In the reductive half-reaction, a proton is transferred from the substrate C1 to betaAsp-128 O-2, in a reaction that proceeds by H-tunneling. Using solution studies, kinetic crystallography, and computational simulation we show that the mechanism of oxidation of aromatic carbinolamines is similar to amine oxidation, but that carbinolamine oxidation occurs at a substantially reduced rate. This has enabled us to determine for the first time the structure of the intermediate prior to the H-transfer/reduction step. The proton-betaAsp-128 O-2 distance is approximately 3.7A, in contrast to the distance of approximately 2.7A predicted for the intermediate formed with the corresponding primary amine substrate. This difference of approximately 1.0 A is due to an unexpected conformation of the substrate moiety, which is supported by molecular dynamic simulations and reflected in the approximately 10(7)-fold slower TTQ reduction rate with phenylaminoethanol compared with that with primary amines. A water molecule is observed near TTQ C-6 and is likely derived from the collapse of the preceding carbinolamine TTQ-adduct. We suggest this water molecule is involved in consecutive proton transfers following TTQ reduction, and is ultimately repositioned near the TTQ O-7 concomitant with protein rearrangement. For all carbinolamines tested, highly stable amide-TTQ adducts are formed following proton abstraction and TTQ reduction. Slow hydrolysis of the amide occurs after, rather than prior to, TTQ oxidation and leads ultimately to a carboxylic acid product.</p>

<p>Human glucokinase (GK) plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. An E339K mutation in GK was recently found to be associated with hyperglycemia. It showed lower enzyme activity and impaired protein stability compared to the wild-type enzyme. Here, we present the crystal structure of E339K GK in complex with glucose. This mutation results in a conformational change of His416, spatially interfering with adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) binding. Furthermore, Ser411 at the ATP binding site is phosphorylated and then hydrogen bonded with Thr82, physically blocking the ATP binding. These findings provide structural basis for the reduced activity of this mutant.</p>

<p>The NADP-dependent non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans (abbreviated Sm-ALDH) belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family. Its catalytic mechanism proceeds via two steps, acylation and deacylation. Its high catalytic efficiency at neutral pH implies prerequisites relative to the chemical mechanism. First, the catalytic Cys284 should be accessible and in a thiolate form at physiological pH to attack efficiently the aldehydic group of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Second, the hydride transfer from the hemithioacetal intermediate toward the nicotinamide ring of NADP should be efficient. Third, the nucleophilic character of the water molecule involved in the deacylation should be strongly increased. Moreover, the different complexes formed during the catalytic process should be stabilised. The crystal structures presented here (an apoenzyme named Apo2 with two sulphate ions bound to the catalytic site, the C284S mutant holoenzyme and the ternary complex composed of the C284S holoenzyme and G3P) together with biochemical results and previously published apo and holo crystal structures (named Apo1 and Holo1, respectively) contribute to the understanding of the ALDH catalytic mechanism. Comparison of Apo1 and Holo1 crystal structures shows a Cys284 side-chain rotation of 110 degrees, upon cofactor binding, which is probably responsible for its pK(a) decrease. In the Apo2 structure, an oxygen atom of a sulphate anion interacts by hydrogen bonds with the NH2 group of a conserved asparagine residue (Asn154 in Sm-ALDH) and the Cys284 NH group. In the ternary complex, the oxygen atom of the aldehydic carbonyl group of the substrate interacts with the Ser284 NH group and the Asn154 NH2 group. A substrate isotope effect on acylation is observed for both the wild-type and the N154A and N154T mutants. The rate of the acylation step strongly decreases for the mutants and becomes limiting. All these results suggest the involvement of Asn154 in an oxyanion hole in order to stabilise the tetrahedral intermediate and likely the other intermediates of the reaction. In the ternary complex, the cofactor conformation is shifted in comparison with its conformation in the C284S holoenzyme structure, likely resulting from its peculiar binding mode to the Rossmann fold (i.e. non-perpendicular to the plane of the beta-sheet). This change is likely favoured by a characteristic loop of the Rossmann fold, longer in ALDHs than in other dehydrogenases, whose orientation could be constrained by a conserved proline residue. In the ternary and C284S holenzyme structures, as well as in the Apo2 structure, the Glu250 side-chain is situated less than 4 A from Cys284 or Ser284 instead of 7 A in the crystal structure of the wild-type holoenzyme. It is now positioned in a hydrophobic environment. This supports the pK(a) assignment of 7.6 to Glu250 as recently proposed from enzymatic studies.</p>

<p>Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), the primary cAMP-hydrolyzing enzyme in cells, is a promising drug target for a wide range of conditions. Here we present seven co-crystal structures of PDE4 and bound inhibitors that show the regulatory domain closed across the active site, thereby revealing the structural basis of PDE4 regulation. This structural insight, together with supporting mutagenesis and kinetic studies, allowed us to design small-molecule allosteric modulators of PDE4D that do not completely inhibit enzymatic activity (I(max) approximately 80-90%). These allosteric modulators have reduced potential to cause emesis, a dose-limiting side effect of existing active site-directed PDE4 inhibitors, while maintaining biological activity in cellular and in vivo models. Our results may facilitate the design of CNS therapeutics modulating cAMP signaling for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia and depression, where brain distribution is desired for therapeutic benefit.</p>

<p>The anticancer complexes cisplatin and carboplatin are known to bind to both the Nδ and the Nℇ atoms of His15 of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). However, neither binds in aqueous media after 4 d of crystallization and crystal growth, suggesting that DMSO facilitates cisplatin/carboplatin binding to the N atoms of His15 by an unknown mechanism. Crystals of HEWL cocrystallized with cisplatin in both aqueous and DMSO media, of HEWL cocrystallized with carboplatin in DMSO medium and of HEWL cocrystallized with cisplatin and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) in DMSO medium were stored for between seven and 15 months. X-ray diffraction studies of these crystals were carried out on a Bruker APEX II home-source diffractometer at room temperature. Room-temperature X-ray diffraction data collection removed the need for cryoprotectants to be used, ruling out any effect that the cryoprotectants might have had on binding to the protein. Both cisplatin and carboplatin still bind to both the Nδ and Nℇ atoms of His15 in DMSO media as expected, but more detail for the cyclobutanedicarboxylate (CBDC) moiety of carboplatin was observed at the Nℇ binding site. However, two molecules of cisplatin were now observed to be bound to His15 in aqueous conditions. The platinum peak positions were identified using anomalous difference electron-density maps as a cross-check with Fo-Fc OMIT electron-density maps. The occupancies of each binding site were calculated using SHELXTL. These results show that over time cisplatin binds to both N atoms of His15 of HEWL in aqueous media, whereas this binding is speeded up in the presence of DMSO. The implication of cisplatin binding to proteins after a prolonged period of time is an important consideration for the length of treatment in patients who are given cisplatin.</p>

<p>Using synchrotron radiation and a CCD camera, X-ray data have been collected from wild-type bovine pancreatic phospholipase A(2) at 100 K to 0.97 A resolution allowing full anisotropic refinement. The final model has a conventional R factor of 9.44% for all reflections, with a mean standard uncertainty for the positional parameters of 0.031 A as calculated from inversion of the full positional least-squares matrix. At 0.97 A resolution, bovine pancreatic phospholipase A(2) reveals for the first time that its rigid scaffolding does not preclude flexibility, which probably plays an important role in the catalytic process. Functionally important regions (the interfacial binding site and calcium-binding loop) are located at the molecular surface, where conformational variability is more pronounced. A cluster of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol molecules is present at the entrance of the hydrophobic channel that leads to the catalytic site and mimics the fatty-acid chains of a substrate analogue. Bovine pancreatic phospholipase A(2) at atomic resolution is compared with previous crystallographic structures and with models derived from nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Given the high structural similarity among extracellular phospholipases A(2) observed so far at lower resolution, the results arising from this structural analysis are expected to be of general validity for this class of enzymes.</p>

<p>Human somatic angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dependent exopeptidase, that catalyses the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to the octapeptide angiotensin II, by removing a C-terminal dipeptide. It is the principal component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood pressure. Hence it is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Here, we report the structures of an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE; a proven structural model for the more complex human ACE) co-crystallized with mammalian peptide substrates (bradykinin, Thr(6) -bradykinin, angiotensin I and a snake venom peptide inhibitor, bradykinin-potentiating peptide-b). The structures determined at 2-Å resolution illustrate that both angiotensin II (the cleaved product of angiotensin I by AnCE) and bradykinin-potentiating peptide-b bind in an analogous fashion at the active site of AnCE, but also exhibit significant differences. In addition, the binding of Arg-Pro-Pro, the cleavage product of bradykinin and Thr(6) - bradykinin, provides additional detail of the general peptide binding in AnCE. Thus the new structures of AnCE complexes presented here improves our understanding of the binding of peptides and the mechanism by which peptides inhibit this family of enzymes.</p>

<p>Cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond that connects the nucleobase to the backbone in DNA leads to abasic sites, the most frequent lesion under physiological conditions. Several DNA polymerases preferentially incorporate an A opposite this lesion, a phenomenon termed "A-rule." Accordingly, KlenTaq, the large fragment of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I, incorporates a nucleotide opposite an abasic site with efficiencies of A &gt; G &gt; T &gt; C. Here we provide structural insights into constraints of the active site during nucleotide selection opposite an abasic site. It appears that these confines govern the nucleotide selection mainly by interaction of the incoming nucleotide with Tyr-671. Depending on the nucleobase, the nucleotides are differently positioned opposite Tyr-671 resulting in different alignments of the functional groups that are required for bond formation. The distances between the α-phosphate and the 3'-primer terminus increases in the order A &lt; G &lt; T, which follows the order of incorporation efficiency. Additionally, a binary KlenTaq structure bound to DNA containing an abasic site indicates that binding of the nucleotide triggers a remarkable rearrangement of enzyme and DNA template. The ability to resolve the stacking arrangement might be dependent on the intrinsic properties of the respective nucleotide contributing to nucleotide selection. Furthermore, we studied the incorporation of a non-natural nucleotide opposite an abasic site. The nucleotide was often used in studying stacking effects in DNA polymerization. Here, no interaction with Tyr-761 as found for the natural nucleotides is observed, indicating a different reaction path for this non-natural nucleotide.</p>

<p>Formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase (FGAR-AT) catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) and glutamine to formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM), ADP, P(i), and glutamate in the fourth step of the purine biosynthetic pathway. In eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria, FGAR-AT is encoded by the purL gene as a multidomain protein with a molecular mass of about 140 kDa. In Gram-positive bacteria and archaebacteria FGAR-AT is a complex of three proteins: PurS, PurL, and PurQ. We have determined the structure of FGAR-AT (PurL) from Salmonella typhimurium at 1.9 A resolution using X-ray crystallography. PurL is the last remaining enzyme in the purine biosynthetic pathway to have its structure determined. The structure reveals four domains: an N-terminal domain structurally homologous to a PurS dimer, a linker region, an FGAM synthetase domain homologous to an aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (PurM) dimer, and a triad glutaminase domain. The domains are intricately linked by interdomain interactions and peptide connectors. The fold common to PurM and the central region of PurL represents a superfamily for which HypE, SelD, and ThiL are predicted to be members. A structural ADP molecule was found bound to a site related to the putative active site by pseudo-2-fold symmetry and two sulfate ions were found at the putative active site. These observations and the structural similarities between PurM and StPurL were used to model the substrates FGAR and ATP in the StPurL active site. A glutamylthioester intermediate was found in the glutaminase domain at Cys1135. The N-terminal (PurS-like) domain is hypothesized to form the putative channel through which ammonia passes from the glutaminase domain to the FGAM synthetase domain.</p>

<p>Making new ligands for a given protein by in situ ligation of building blocks (or fragments) is an attractive method. However, it suffers from inherent limitations, such as the limited number of available chemical reactions and the low information content of usual chemical library deconvolution. Here, we describe a focused screening of adenosine derivatives using X-ray crystallography. We discovered an unexpected and biocompatible chemical reactivity and have simultaneously identified the mode of binding of the resulting products. We observed that the NAD kinase from Listeria monocytogenes (LmNADK1) can promote amide formation between 5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine and carboxylic acid groups. This unexpected reactivity allowed us to bridge in situ two adenosine derivatives to fully occupy the active NAD site. This guided the design of a close analog showing micromolar inhibition of two human pathogenic NAD kinases and potent bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus in vitro.</p>

<p>A series of arylsulfonamides has been synthesized and investigated for the inhibition of some selected human carbonic anhydrase isoforms. The studied compounds showed significant inhibitory effects in the nanomolar range toward druggable isoforms (hCA VII, hCA IX, and hCA XIV) (K(i) values from 4.8 to 61.7 nM), whereas they generally exhibited significant selectivity over hCA I and hCA II, that are ubiquitous and considered off-target isoforms. On the basis of biochemical data, we herein discussed structure-affinity relationships for this series of arylsulfonamides, suggesting a key role for alkoxy substituents in CA inhibition. Furthermore, X-ray crystal structures of complexes of two active inhibitors (I and 2a) with hCA II allowed us to elucidate the main interactions between the inhibitor and specific amino acid residues within the catalytic site.</p>

<p>hBChE [human BChE (butyrylcholinesterase)] naturally scavenges OPs (organophosphates). This bioscavenger is currently in Clinical Phase I for pretreatment of OP intoxication. Phosphylated ChEs (cholinesterases) can undergo a spontaneous time-dependent process called 'aging' during which the conjugate is dealkylated, leading to creation of an enzyme that cannot be reactivated. hBChE inhibited by phosphoramidates such as tabun displays a peculiar resistance to oxime-mediated reactivation. We investigated the basis of oxime resistance of phosphoramidyl-BChE conjugates by determining the kinetics of inhibition, reactivation (obidoxime {1,1'-(oxybis-methylene) bis[4-(hydroxyimino) methyl] pyridinium dichloride}, TMB-4 [1,3-trimethylene-bis(4-hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium) dibromide], HLö 7 {1-[[[4-(aminocarbonyl) pyridinio]methoxy]methyl]-2,4-bis-[(hydroxyimino)methyl] pyridinium dimethanesulfonate)}, HI-6 {1-[[[4-(aminocarbonyl) pyridinio] methoxy] methyl]-2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]pyridinium dichloride monohydrate} and aging, and the crystal structures of hBChE inhibited by different N-monoalkyl and N,N-dialkyl tabun analogues. The refined structures of aged hBChE conjugates show that aging proceeds through O-dealkylation of the P(R) enantiomer of N,N-diethyl and N-propyl analogues, with subsequent formation of a salt bridge preventing reactivation, similarly to a previous observation made on tabun-ChE conjugates. Interestingly, the N-methyl analogue projects its amino group towards the choline-binding pocket, so that aging proceeds through deamination. This orientation results from a preference of hBChE's acyl-binding pocket for larger than 2-atoms linear substituents. The correlation between the inhibitory potency and the N-monoalkyl chain length is related to increasingly optimized interactions with the acyl-binding pocket as shown by the X-ray structures. These kinetics and X-ray data lead to a structure-activity relationship that highlights steric and electronic effects of the amino substituent of phosphoramidate. This study provides the structural basis to design new oximes capable of reactivating phosphoramidyl-hBChE conjugates after intoxication, notably when hBChE is used as pretreatment, or to design BChE-based catalytic bioscavengers.</p>

<p>Flavonoids are known for their beneficial effects on human health, and therefore the therapeutic potential of these compounds have been extensively studied. Flavone has been previously identified as a tankyrase inhibitor, and to further elucidate whether tankyrases would be inhibited by other flavonoids, we performed a systematic screening of tankyrase 2 inhibitory activity using 500 natural and naturally derived flavonoids covering nine different flavonoid classes. All identified tankyrase inhibitors were flavones. We report crystal structures of all the hit compounds in complex with the catalytic domain of human tankyrase 2. Flavone derivatives in all 10 crystal structures bind to the nicotinamide binding site of tankyrase 2. Potencies of the active flavones toward tankyrases vary between 50 nM and 1.1 μM, and flavones show up to 200-fold selectivity for tankyrases over ARTD1. The molecular details of the interactions revealed by cocrystal structures efficiently describe the properties of potent flavone derivatives inhibiting tankyrases.</p>

<p>GRL007 and GRL008, two structurally related nonpeptidic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors (PIs) containing 3(R),3a(S),6a(R)-bis-tetrahydrofuranylurethane (bis-THF) as the P2 moiety and a sulfonamide isostere consisting of benzene carboxylic acid and benzene carboxamide as the P2' moiety, respectively, were evaluated for their antiviral activity and interactions with wild-type protease (PR(WT)). Both GRL007 (Ki of 12.7 pM with PR(WT)) and GRL008 (Ki of 8.9 pM) inhibited PR(WT) with high potency in vitro. X-ray crystallographic analysis of PR(WT) in complex with GRL007 or GRL008 showed that the bis-THF moiety of both compounds has three direct polar contacts with the backbone amide nitrogen atoms of Asp29 and Asp30 of PR(WT). The P2' moiety of both compounds showed one direct contact with the backbone of Asp30' and a bridging polar contact with Gly48' through a water molecule. Cell-based antiviral assays showed that GRL007 was inactive (50% effective concentration [EC50] of &gt;1 μM) while GRL008 was highly active (EC50 of 0.04 μM) against wild-type HIV-1. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/mass spectrometry-based cellular uptake assays showed 8.1- and 84-fold higher intracellular concentrations of GRL008 than GRL007 in human MT-2 and MT-4 cell extracts, respectively. Thus, GRL007, in spite of its favorable enzyme-inhibitory activity and protease binding profile, exhibited a lack of antiviral activity in cell-based assays, most likely due to its compromised cellular uptake associated with its P2' benzene carboxylic acid moiety. The anti-HIV-1 potency, favorable toxicity, and binding profile of GRL008 suggest that further optimization of the P2' moiety may improve its antiretroviral features. </p>

<p>Fucosylated glycoconjugates are involved in numerous biological events, and alpha-l-fucosidases, the enzymes responsible for their processing, are therefore of crucial importance. Deficiency in alpha-l-fucosidase activity is associated with fucosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by rapid neurodegeneration, resulting in severe mental and motor deterioration. To gain insight into alpha-l-fucosidase function at the molecular level, we have determined the crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima alpha-l-fucosidase. This enzyme assembles as a hexamer and displays a two-domain fold, composed of a catalytic (beta/alpha)(8)-like domain and a C-terminal beta-sandwich domain. The structures of an enzyme-product complex and of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, coupled with kinetic and mutagenesis studies, allowed us to identify the catalytic nucleophile, Asp(244), and the Brønsted acid/base, Glu(266). Because T. maritima alpha-l-fucosidase occupies a unique evolutionary position, being far more closely related to the mammalian enzymes than to any other prokaryotic homolog, a structural model of the human enzyme was built to document the structural consequences of the genetic mutations associated with fucosidosis.</p>

<p>Flavonoids are known for their beneficial effects on human health, and therefore the therapeutic potential of these compounds have been extensively studied. Flavone has been previously identified as a tankyrase inhibitor, and to further elucidate whether tankyrases would be inhibited by other flavonoids, we performed a systematic screening of tankyrase 2 inhibitory activity using 500 natural and naturally derived flavonoids covering nine different flavonoid classes. All identified tankyrase inhibitors were flavones. We report crystal structures of all the hit compounds in complex with the catalytic domain of human tankyrase 2. Flavone derivatives in all 10 crystal structures bind to the nicotinamide binding site of tankyrase 2. Potencies of the active flavones toward tankyrases vary between 50 nM and 1.1 μM, and flavones show up to 200-fold selectivity for tankyrases over ARTD1. The molecular details of the interactions revealed by cocrystal structures efficiently describe the properties of potent flavone derivatives inhibiting tankyrases.</p>

<p>Selenocysteine is the only genetically encoded amino acid in humans whose biosynthesis occurs on its cognate transfer RNA (tRNA). O-Phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase (SepSecS) catalyzes the final step of selenocysteine formation by a poorly understood tRNA-dependent mechanism. The crystal structure of human tRNA(Sec) in complex with SepSecS, phosphoserine, and thiophosphate, together with in vivo and in vitro enzyme assays, supports a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent mechanism of Sec-tRNA(Sec) formation. Two tRNA(Sec) molecules, with a fold distinct from other canonical tRNAs, bind to each SepSecS tetramer through their 13-base pair acceptor-TPsiC arm (where Psi indicates pseudouridine). The tRNA binding is likely to induce a conformational change in the enzyme's active site that allows a phosphoserine covalently attached to tRNA(Sec), but not free phosphoserine, to be oriented properly for the reaction to occur.</p>

<p>We have used chemical protein synthesis and advanced physical methods to probe dynamics-function correlations for the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme that has received considerable attention as a target for the treatment of AIDS. Chemical synthesis was used to prepare a series of unique analogues of the HIV-1 protease in which the flexibility of the "flap" structures (residues 37-61 in each monomer of the homodimeric protein molecule) was systematically varied. These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations. We show that conformational isomerization in the flaps is correlated with structural reorganization of residues in the active site, and that it is preorganization of the active site that is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis.</p>

<p>Class A carbapenemases are a major threat to the potency of carbapenem antibiotics. A widespread carbapenemase, KPC-2, is not easily inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors (i.e., clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam). To explore different mechanisms of inhibition of KPC-2, we determined the crystal structures of KPC-2 with two β-lactamase inhibitors that follow different inactivation pathways and kinetics. The first complex is that of a small boronic acid compound, 3-nitrophenyl boronic acid (3-NPBA), bound to KPC-2 with 1.62-Å resolution. 3-NPBA demonstrated a K(m) value of 1.0 ± 0.1 μM (mean ± standard error) for KPC-2 and blocks the active site by making a reversible covalent interaction with the catalytic S70 residue. The two boron hydroxyl atoms of 3-NPBA are positioned in the oxyanion hole and the deacylation water pocket, respectively. In addition, the aromatic ring of 3-NPBA provides an edge-to-face interaction with W105 in the active site. The structure of KPC-2 with the penam sulfone PSR-3-226 was determined at 1.26-Å resolution. PSR-3-226 displayed a K(m) value of 3.8 ± 0.4 μM for KPC-2, and the inactivation rate constant (k(inact)) was 0.034 ± 0.003 s(-1). When covalently bound to S70, PSR-3-226 forms a trans-enamine intermediate in the KPC-2 active site. The predominant active site interactions are generated via the carbonyl oxygen, which resides in the oxyanion hole, and the carboxyl moiety of PSR-3-226, which interacts with N132, N170, and E166. 3-NPBA and PSR-3-226 are the first β-lactamase inhibitors to be trapped as an acyl-enzyme complex with KPC-2. The structural and inhibitory insights gained here could aid in the design of potent KPC-2 inhibitors.</p>

<p>Resuscitation of Mtb is crucial to the etiology of Tuberculosis, because latent tuberculosis is estimated to affect one-third of the world population. The resuscitation-promoting factor RpfB is mainly responsible for Mtb resuscitation from dormancy. Given the impact of latent Tuberculosis, RpfB represents an interesting target for tuberculosis drug discovery. However, no molecular models of substrate binding and catalysis are hitherto available for this enzyme. Here, we identified key interactions involved in substrate binding to RpfB by combining x-ray diffraction studies and computational approaches. The crystal structure of RpfB catalytic domain in complex with N,N',N"-triacetyl-chitotriose, as described here, provides the first, to our knowledge, atomic representation of ligand recognition by RpfB and demonstrates that the strongest interactions are established by the N-acetylglucosamine moiety in the central region of the enzyme binding cleft. Molecular dynamics analyses provided information on the dynamic behavior of protein-substrate interactions and on the role played by the solvent in RpfB function. These data combined with sequence conservation analysis suggest that Glu-292 is the sole residue crucial for catalysis, implying that RpfB acts via the formation of an oxocarbenium ion rather than a covalent intermediate. Present data represent a solid base for the design of effective drug inhibitors of RpfB. Moreover, homology models were generated for the catalytic domains of all members of the Mtb Rpf family (RpfA-E). The analysis of these models unveiled analogies and differences among the different members of the Rpf protein family.</p>

<p>The C2 domain acts as a membrane-targeting module in a diverse group of proteins including classical protein kinase Cs (PKCs), where it plays an essential role in activation via calcium-dependent interactions with phosphatidylserine. The three-dimensional structures of the Ca(2+)-bound forms of the PKCalpha-C2 domain both in the absence and presence of 1, 2-dicaproyl-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine have now been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.4 and 2.6 A resolution, respectively. In the structure of the C2 ternary complex, the glycerophosphoserine moiety of the phospholipid adopts a quasi-cyclic conformation, with the phosphoryl group directly coordinated to one of the Ca(2+) ions. Specific recognition of the phosphatidylserine is reinforced by additional hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with protein residues in the vicinity of the Ca(2+) binding region. The central feature of the PKCalpha-C2 domain structure is an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta-barrel with a molecular topology and organization of the Ca(2+) binding region closely related to that found in PKCbeta-C2, although only two Ca(2+) ions have been located bound to the PKCalpha-C2 domain. The structural information provided by these results suggests a membrane binding mechanism of the PKCalpha-C2 domain in which calcium ions directly mediate the phosphatidylserine recognition while the calcium binding region 3 might penetrate into the phospholipid bilayer.</p>

<p>Prokaryotic glutathione S-transferases are as diverse as their eukaryotic counterparts but are much less well characterized. BphK from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 consumes two GSH molecules to reductively dehalogenate chlorinated 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-2,4-dienoates (HOPDAs), inhibitory polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites. Crystallographic structures of two ternary complexes of BphK were solved to a resolution of 2.1A. In the BphK-GSH-HOPDA complex, GSH and HOPDA molecules occupy the G- and H-subsites, respectively. The thiol nucleophile of the GSH molecule is positioned for SN2 attack at carbon 3 of the bound HOPDA. The respective sulfur atoms of conserved Cys-10 and the bound GSH are within 3.0A, consistent with product release and the formation of a mixed disulfide intermediate. In the BphK-(GSH)2 complex, a GSH molecule occupies each of the two subsites. The three sulfur atoms of the two GSH molecules and Cys-10 are aligned suitably for a disulfide exchange reaction that would regenerate the resting enzyme and yield disulfide-linked GSH molecules. A second conserved residue, His-106, is adjacent to the thiols of Cys-10 and the GSH bound to the G-subsite and thus may stabilize a transition state in the disulfide exchange reaction. Overall, the structures support and elaborate a proposed dehalogenation mechanism for BphK and provide insight into the plasticity of the H-subsite.</p>

<p>The sesquiterpene bisabolene was recently identified as a biosynthetic precursor to bisabolane, an advanced biofuel with physicochemical properties similar to those of D2 diesel. High-titer microbial bisabolene production was achieved using Abies grandis α-bisabolene synthase (AgBIS). Here, we report the structure of AgBIS, a three-domain plant sesquiterpene synthase, crystallized in its apo form and bound to five different inhibitors. Structural and biochemical characterization of the AgBIS terpene synthase Class I active site leads us to propose a catalytic mechanism for the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate into bisabolene via a bisabolyl cation intermediate. Further, we describe the nonfunctional AgBIS Class II active site whose high similarity to bifunctional diterpene synthases makes it an important link in understanding terpene synthase evolution. Practically, the AgBIS crystal structure is important in future protein engineering efforts to increase the microbial production of bisabolene.</p>

<p>Copper active sites play a major role in enzymatic activation of dioxygen. We trapped the copper-dioxygen complex in the enzyme peptidylglycine-alphahydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) by freezing protein crystals that had been soaked with a slow substrate and ascorbate in the presence of oxygen. The x-ray crystal structure of this precatalytic complex, determined to 1.85-angstrom resolution, shows that oxygen binds to one of the coppers in the enzyme with an end-on geometry. Given this structure, it is likely that dioxygen is directly involved in the electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction steps of the PHM reaction. These insights may apply to other copper oxygen-activating enzymes, such as dopamine beta-monooxygenase, and to the design of biomimetic complexes.</p>

<p>Tremendous gains and novel methods are often developed when people are challenged to do something new or difficult.

In order for this challenge to occur, data must be supplied so the prospective test can be done.

<p>Inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway has emerged as one of the most promising new approaches for cancer therapy.

<p>Chloroperoxidase (CPO) is a heme-thiolate enzyme that catalyzes hydrogen peroxide-dependent halogenation reactions. Structural data on substrate binding have not been available so far. CPO was therefore crystallized in the presence of iodide or bromide. One halide binding site was identified at the surface near a narrow channel that connects the surface with the heme. Two other halide binding sites were identified within and at the other end of this channel. Together, these sites suggest a pathway for access of halide anions to the active site. The structure of CPO complexed with its natural substrate cyclopentanedione was determined at a resolution of 1.8 A. This is the first example of a CPO structure with a bound organic substrate. In addition, structures of CPO bound with nitrate, acetate, and formate and of a ternary complex with dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and cyanide were determined. These structures have implications for the mechanism of compound I formation. Before binding to the heme, the incoming hydrogen peroxide first interacts with Glu-183. The deprotonated Glu-183 abstracts a proton from hydrogen peroxide. The hydroperoxo-anion then binds at the heme, yielding compound 0. Glu-183 protonates the distal oxygen of compound 0, water is released, and compound I is formed.</p>

<p>Mammalian members of glycosyltransferase family 6 (GT6) of the CAZy database have a GT-A fold containing a conserved Asp-X-Asp (DXD) sequence that binds an essential metal cofactor. Bacteroides ovatus GT6a represents a GT6 clade found in more than 30 Gram-negative bacteria that is similar in sequence to the catalytic domains of mammalian GT6, but has an Asn(95)-Ala-Asn(97) (NXN) sequence substituted for the DXD motif and metal-independent catalytic activity. Co-crystals of a low activity mutant of BoGT6a (E192Q) with UDP-GalNAc contained protein complexes with intact UDP-GalNAc and two forms with hydrolysis products (UDP plus GalNAc) representing an initial closed complex and later open form primed for product release. Two cationic residues near the C terminus of BoGT6a, Lys(231) and Arg(243), interact with the diphosphate moiety of UDP-GalNAc, but only Lys(231) interacts with the UDP product and may function in leaving group stabilization. The amide group of Asn(95), the first Asn of the NXN motif, interacts with the ribose moiety of the substrate. This metal-independent GT6 resembles its metal-dependent homologs in undergoing conformational changes on binding UDP-GalNAc that arise from structuring the C terminus to cover this substrate. It appears that in the GT6 family, the metal cofactor functions specifically in binding the UDP moiety in the donor substrate and transition state, actions that can be efficiently performed by components of the polypeptide chain. </p>

<p>Methanogenic archaea possess unusual seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), evolutionarily distinct from the SerRSs found in other archaea, eucaryotes and bacteria. The two types of SerRSs show only minimal sequence similarity, primarily within class II conserved motifs 1, 2 and 3. Here, we report a 2.5 A resolution crystal structure of the atypical methanogenic Methanosarcina barkeri SerRS and its complexes with ATP, serine and the nonhydrolysable seryl-adenylate analogue 5'-O-(N-serylsulfamoyl)adenosine. The structures reveal two idiosyncratic features of methanogenic SerRSs: a novel N-terminal tRNA-binding domain and an active site zinc ion. The tetra-coordinated Zn2+ ion is bound to three conserved protein ligands (Cys306, Glu355 and Cys461) and binds the amino group of the serine substrate. The absolute requirement of the metal ion for enzymatic activity was confirmed by mutational analysis of the direct zinc ion ligands. This zinc-dependent serine recognition mechanism differs fundamentally from the one employed by the bacterial-type SerRSs. Consequently, SerRS represents the only known aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase system that evolved two distinct mechanisms for the recognition of the same amino-acid substrate.</p>

<p>Kinetic studies and analysis of the products formed by native and mutant forms of ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 (oPGHS-1) have suggested that arachidonic acid (AA) can exist in the cyclooxygenase active site of the enzyme in three different, catalytically competent conformations that lead to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), 11R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE), and 15R,S-HPETE, respectively. We have identified an oPGHS-1 mutant (V349A/W387F) that forms predominantly 11R-HPETE. Thus, the preferred catalytically competent arrangement of AA in the cyclooxygenase site of this double mutant must be one that leads to 11-HPETE. The crystal structure of Co3+-protoporphyrin IX V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 in a complex with AA was determined to 3.1 A. Significant differences are observed in the positions of atoms C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-10, C-11, and C-12 of bound AA between native and V349A/W387F oPGHS-1; in comparison, the positions of the side chains of cyclooxygenase active site residues are unchanged. The structure of the double mutant presented here provides structural insight as to how Val349 and Trp387 help position C-9 and C-11 of AA so that the incipient 11-peroxyl radical intermediate is able to add to C-9 to form the 9,11 endoperoxide group of PGG2. In the V349A/W387F oPGHS-1.AA complex the locations of C-9 and C-11 of AA with respect to one another make it difficult to form the endoperoxide group from the 11-hydroperoxyl radical. Therefore, the reaction apparently aborts yielding 11R-HPETE instead of PGG2. In addition, the observed differences in the positions of carbon atoms of AA bound to this mutant provides indirect support for the concept that the conformer of AA shown previously to be bound within the cyclooxygenase active site of native oPGHS-1 is the one that leads to PGG2.</p>

<p>MutM, a bacterial DNA-glycosylase, plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity by catalyzing glycosidic bond cleavage of 8-oxoguanine (oxoG) lesions to initiate base excision DNA repair. The task faced by MutM of locating rare oxoG residues embedded in an overwhelming excess of undamaged bases is especially challenging given the close structural similarity between oxoG and its normal progenitor, guanine (G). MutM actively interrogates the DNA to detect the presence of an intrahelical, fully base-paired oxoG, whereupon the enzyme promotes extrusion of the target nucleobase from the DNA duplex and insertion into the extrahelical active site. Recent structural studies have begun to provide the first glimpse into the protein-DNA interactions that enable MutM to distinguish an intrahelical oxoG from G; however, these initial studies left open the important question of how MutM can recognize oxoG residues embedded in 16 different neighboring sequence contexts (considering only the 5'- and 3'-neighboring base pairs). In this study we set out to understand the manner and extent to which intrahelical lesion recognition varies as a function of the 5'-neighbor. Here we report a comprehensive, systematic structural analysis of the effect of the 5'-neighboring base pair on recognition of an intrahelical oxoG lesion. These structures reveal that MutM imposes the same extrusion-prone ("extrudogenic") backbone conformation on the oxoG lesion irrespective of its 5'-neighbor while leaving the rest of the DNA relatively free to adjust to the particular demands of individual sequences.</p>

<p>Peptides that inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase 2 by blocking the macromolecular substrate recruitment site of cyclin A were simplified, for example, by replacement of dipeptide units with beta-amino acids. The smallest inhibitor retaining activity was a tripeptide, whose binding mode was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. This result suggests that nonpeptidic cyclin groove inhibitors may be feasible therapeutic agents.The cyclin-dependent kinase 2-cyclin A complex is an important regulator of the DNA-synthesis phase of the mammalian cell cycle, which is frequently deregulated in cancer. Rather than blocking the ATP-binding site of the apparently redundant kinase subunit, targeting the binding site for macromolecular substrates and regulatory proteins of cyclin A represents a promising strategy to enforce tumour-selective apoptosis. The cyclin-binding groove can be blocked with comparatively small synthetic peptides, which indirectly leads to inhibition of kinase function, but these peptides are metabolically labile and membrane impermeable. As part of our ongoing effort to develop more druglike peptidomimetics derived from cyclin-groove-binding peptides, we report the results of our studies aimed at a detailed understanding of the structural determinants required for effective binding. Using a combination of peptide synthesis, biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography, we show that it is possible to simplify peptide structures through the replacement of dipeptide units in which one of the residues is not directly involved in binding, through the introduction of beta-amino acid residues that retain only the dipeptide residue side chain that is important for binding. This approach also allowed us to probe spatial constraints in general, as well as the importance of peptide backbone hydrogen-bonding functions. Our identification of potent beta-homoleucine-containing tetrapeptide inhibitors, as well as the finding that an optimised N-terminally acetylated tripeptide retains some cyclin A-binding affinity, suggest that the pharmacological targeting of the cyclin A binding groove may be feasible.</p>

<p>We have determined the x-ray crystal structure of L-lysine ε-oxidase from Marinomonas mediterranea in its native and L-lysine-complex forms at 1.94- and 1.99-Å resolution, respectively. In the native enzyme, electron densities clearly indicate the presence of cysteine tryptophylquinone (CTQ) previously identified in quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase. In the L-lysine-complex, an electron density corresponding to the bound L-lysine shows that its ε-amino group is attached to the C6 carbonyl group of CTQ, suggesting the formation of a Schiff-base intermediate. Collectively, the present crystal structure provides the first example of an enzyme employing a tryptophylquinone cofactor in an amine oxidase.</p>

<p>1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (MIP) synthase catalyzes the conversion of d-glucose 6-phosphate to 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate, the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of all inositol-containing compounds. It involves an oxidation, enolization, intramolecular aldol cyclization, and reduction. Here we present the structure of MIP synthase in complex with NAD(+) and a high-affinity inhibitor, 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate. This structure reveals interactions between the enzyme active site residues and the inhibitor that are significantly different from that proposed for 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate in the previously published structure of MIP synthase-NAD(+)-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate. There are several other conformational changes in NAD(+) and the enzyme active site as well. Based on the new structural data, we propose a new and completely different mechanism for MIP synthase.</p>

<p>The Mo-flavo-Fe/S-dependent heterohexameric protein complex 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase (4-HBCR, dehydroxylating) is a central enzyme of the anaerobic degradation of phenolic compounds and belongs to the xanthine oxidase (XO) family of molybdenum enzymes. Its X-ray structure was established at 1.6 A resolution. The most pronounced difference between 4-HBCR and other structurally characterized members of the XO family is the insertion of 40 amino acids within the beta subunit, which carries an additional [4Fe-4S] cluster at a distance of 16.5 A to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. The architecture of 4-HBCR and concomitantly performed electron transfer rate calculations suggest an inverted electron transfer chain from the donor ferredoxin via the [4Fe-4S] cluster to the Mo over a distance of 55 A. The binding site of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA is located in an 18 A long channel lined up by several aromatic side chains around the aromatic moiety, which are proposed to shield and stabilize the postulated radical intermediates during catalysis.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of toluene 4-monooxygenase hydroxylase in complex with reaction products and effector protein reveal active site interactions leading to regiospecificity. Complexes with phenolic products yield an asymmetric μ-phenoxo-bridged diiron center and a shift of diiron ligand E231 into a hydrogen bonding position with conserved T201. In contrast, complexes with inhibitors p-NH(2)-benzoate and p-Br-benzoate showed a μ-1,1 coordination of carboxylate oxygen between the iron atoms and only a partial shift in the position of E231. Among active site residues, F176 trapped the aromatic ring of products against a surface of the active site cavity formed by G103, E104 and A107, while F196 positioned the aromatic ring against this surface via a π-stacking interaction. The proximity of G103 and F176 to the para substituent of the substrate aromatic ring and the structure of G103L T4moHD suggest how changes in regiospecificity arise from mutations at G103. Although effector protein binding produced significant shifts in the positions of residues along the outer portion of the active site (T201, N202, and Q228) and in some iron ligands (E231 and E197), surprisingly minor shifts (&lt;1 Å) were produced in F176, F196, and other interior residues of the active site. Likewise, products bound to the diiron center in either the presence or absence of effector protein did not significantly shift the position of the interior residues, suggesting that positioning of the cognate substrates will not be strongly influenced by effector protein binding. Thus, changes in product distributions in the absence of the effector protein are proposed to arise from differences in rates of chemical steps of the reaction relative to motion of substrates within the active site channel of the uncomplexed, less efficient enzyme, while structural changes in diiron ligand geometry associated with cycling between diferrous and diferric states are discussed for their potential contribution to product release.</p>

<p>The diheme enzyme MauG catalyzes the posttranslational modification of the precursor protein of methylamine dehydrogenase (preMADH) to complete biosynthesis of its protein-derived tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor. Catalysis proceeds through a high valent bis-Fe(IV) redox state and requires long-range electron transfer (ET), as the distance between the modified residues of preMADH and the nearest heme iron of MauG is 19.4 Å. Trp199 of MauG resides at the MauG-preMADH interface, positioned midway between the residues that are modified and the nearest heme. W199F and W199K mutations did not affect the spectroscopic and redox properties of MauG, or its ability to stabilize the bis-Fe(IV) state. Crystal structures of complexes of W199F/K MauG with preMADH showed no significant perturbation of the MauG-preMADH structure or protein interface. However, neither MauG variant was able to synthesize TTQ from preMADH. In contrast, an ET reaction from diferrous MauG to quinone MADH, which does not require the bis-Fe(IV) intermediate, was minimally affected by the W199F/K mutations. W199F/K MauGs were able to oxidize quinol MADH to form TTQ, the putative final two-electron oxidation of the biosynthetic process, but with k(cat)/K(m) values approximately 10% that of wild-type MauG. The differential effects of the W199F/K mutations on these three different reactions are explained by a critical role for Trp199 in mediating multistep hopping from preMADH to bis-Fe(IV) MauG during the long-range ET that is required for TTQ biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Glycogenin initiates the synthesis of a maltosaccharide chain covalently attached to itself on Tyr195 via a stepwise glucosylation reaction, priming glycogen synthesis. We have captured crystallographic snapshots of human glycogenin during its reaction cycle, revealing a dynamic conformational switch between ground and active states mediated by the sugar donor UDP-glucose. This switch includes the ordering of a polypeptide stretch containing Tyr195, and major movement of an approximately 30-residue "lid" segment covering the active site. The rearranged lid guides the nascent maltosaccharide chain into the active site in either an intra- or intersubunit mode dependent upon chain length and steric factors and positions the donor and acceptor sugar groups for catalysis. The Thr83Met mutation, which causes glycogen storage disease XV, is conformationally locked in the ground state and catalytically inactive. Our data highlight the conformational plasticity of glycogenin and coexistence of two modes of glucosylation as integral to its catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Interconversion of D-ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and D-ribulose-5-phosphate is an important step in the pentose phosphate pathway. Two unrelated enzymes with R5P isomerase activity were first identified in Escherichia coli, RpiA and RpiB. In this organism, the essential 5-carbon sugars were thought to be processed by RpiA, while the primary role of RpiB was suggested to instead be interconversion of the rare 6-carbon sugars D-allose-6-phosphate (All6P) and D-allulose-6-phosphate. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, where only an RpiB is found, the 5-carbon sugars are believed to be the enzyme's primary substrates. Here, we present kinetic studies examining the All6P isomerase activity of the RpiBs from these two organisms and show that only the E. coli enzyme can catalyze the reaction efficiently. All6P instead acts as an inhibitor of the M. tuberculosis enzyme in its action on R5P. X-ray studies of the M. tuberculosis enzyme co-crystallized with All6P and 5-deoxy-5-phospho-D-ribonohydroxamate (an inhibitor designed to mimic the 6-carbon sugar) and comparison with the E. coli enzyme's structure allowed us to identify differences in the active sites that explain the kinetic results. Two other structures, that of a mutant E. coli RpiB in which histidine 99 was changed to asparagine and that of wild-type M. tuberculosis enzyme, both co-crystallized with the substrate ribose-5-phosphate, shed additional light on the reaction mechanism of RpiBs generally.</p>

<p>FixL from Bradyrhizobium japonicum is a PAS sensor protein in which two PAS domains covalently linked to a histidine kinase domain are responsible for regulating nitrogen fixation in an oxygen-dependent manner. The more C-terminal PAS domain, denoted bjFixLH, contains a heme cofactor that binds diatomic molecules such as carbon monoxide and oxygen and regulates the activity of the FixL histidine kinase as part of a two-component signaling system. We present the structures of ferric, deoxy, and carbon monoxide-bound bjFixLH in a new space group ( P1) and at resolutions (1.5-1.8 A) higher than the resolutions of those previously obtained. Interestingly, bjFixLH can form two different dimers (in P1 and R32 crystal forms) in the same crystallization solution, where the monomers in one dimer are rotated approximately 175 degrees relative to the second. This suggests that PAS monomers are plastic and that two quite distinct quaternary structures are closely similar in free energy. We use screw rotation analysis to carry out a quantitative pairwise comparison of PAS quaternary structures, which identifies five different relative orientations adopted by isolated PAS monomers. We conclude that PAS monomer arrangement is context-dependent and could differ depending on whether the PAS domains are isolated or are part of a full-length protein. Structurally homologous residues comprise a conserved dimer interface. Using network analysis, we find that the architecture of the PAS dimer interface is continuous rather than modular; the network of residues comprising the interface is strongly connected. A continuous dimer interface is consistent with the low dimer-monomer dissociation equilibrium constant. Finally, we quantitate quaternary structural changes induced by carbon monoxide binding to a bjFixLH dimer, in which monomers rotate by up to approximately 2 degrees relative to each other. We relate these changes to those in other dimeric PAS domains and discuss the role of quaternary structural changes in the signaling mechanisms of PAS sensor proteins.</p>

<p>RtcB is an atypical RNA ligase that joins either 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or 3'-phosphate termini to 5'-hydroxyl termini. In contrast to typical RNA ligases, which rely on ATP and Mg(II), catalysis by RtcB is dependent on GTP and Mn(II) with ligation proceeding through a covalent RtcB-histidine-GMP intermediate. Here, we present three structures of Pyrococcus horikoshii RtcB complexes that capture snapshots along the entire guanylylation pathway. These structures show that prior to binding GTP, a single manganese ion (Mn1) is bound to RtcB. To capture the step immediately preceding RtcB guanylylation, we determined a structure of RtcB in complex with Mn(II) and the unreactive GTP analogue guanosine 5'-(α-thio)triphosphate (GTPαS). This structure shows that Mn1 is poised to stabilize the pentavalent transition state of guanylylation while a second manganese ion (Mn2) is coordinated to a nonbridging oxygen of the γ-phosphoryl group. The pyrophosphate leaving group of GTPαS is oriented apically to His404 with the ε-nitrogen poised for in-line attack on the α-phosphorus atom. The structure of RtcB in complex with GTPαS also reveals the network of hydrogen bonds that recognize GTP and illuminates the significant conformational changes that accompany the binding of this cofactor. Finally, a structure of the enzymic histidine-GMP intermediate depicts the end of the guanylylation pathway. The ensuing molecular description of the RtcB guanylylation pathway shows that RtcB and classical ATP- and Mg(II)-dependent nucleic acid ligases have converged upon a similar two-metal mechanism for formation of the nucleotidylated enzyme intermediate.</p>

<p>The inclusion of novel small molecules in crystallization experiments has provided very encouraging results and this method is now emerging as a promising alternative strategy for crystallizing 'problematic' biological macromolecules. These small molecules have the ability to promote lattice formation through stabilizing intermolecular interactions in protein crystals. Here, the use of 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid (PTS), which provides a helpful intermolecular bridge between Leishmania mexicana PYK (LmPYK) macromolecules in the crystal, is reported, resulting in the rapid formation of a more stable crystal lattice at neutral pH and greatly improved X-ray diffraction results. The refined structure of the LmPYK-PTS complex revealed the negatively charged PTS molecule to be stacked between positively charged (surface-exposed) arginine side chains from neighbouring LmPYK molecules in the crystal lattice.</p>

<p>Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are dimeric enzymes containing one active-site per monomer. The omega-class GSTs (hGSTO1-1 and hGSTO2-2 in humans) are homodimeric and carry out a range of reactions including the glutathione-dependant reduction of a range of compounds and the reduction of S-(phenacyl)glutathiones to acetophenones. Both types of reaction result in the formation of a mixed-disulfide of the enzyme with glutathione through the catalytic cysteine (C32). Recycling of the enzyme utilizes a second glutathione molecule and results in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) release. The crystal structure of an active-site mutant (C32A) of the hGSTO1-1 isozyme in complex with GSSG provides a snapshot of the enzyme in the process of regeneration. GSSG occupies both the G (GSH-binding) and H (hydrophobic-binding) sites and causes re-arrangement of some H-site residues. In the same structure we demonstrate the existence of a novel "ligandin" binding site deep within in the dimer interface of this enzyme, containing S-(4-nitrophenacyl)glutathione, an isozyme-specific substrate for hGSTO1-1. The ligandin site, conserved in Omega class GSTs from a range of species, is hydrophobic in nature and may represent the binding location for tocopherol esters that are uncompetitive hGSTO1-1 inhibitors.</p>

<p>Matriptase, a type II trans-membrane serine protease of the S1 trypsin-like family, is expressed on the surface of nearly all normal human epithelium and found in biological fluid-like human milk. Matriptase overexpression has been implicated in tumor progression in certain epithelium-derived cancer cells. Matriptase is tightly regulated by its cognate inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1). It has been demonstrated that the Kunitz domain I (KD1) but not Kunitz domain II (KD2) of HAI-1 is responsible for the inhibitory activity of HAI-1 against matriptase. To investigate the molecular basis of inhibition of matriptase by HAI-1, we solved several crystal structures of matriptase serine protease domain in complex with the fragments of HAI-1. Based on these structures, we found that the binding of KD1 was different from previously predicted binding mode. The P3 arginine residue occupies the S3 specificity pocket of matriptase, but not the S4 pocket as in the cases of hepatocyte growth factor activator·HAI-1 KD1 and matriptase·sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1 complexes. The long 60-loop of matriptase makes direct contact with HAI-1 but remains flexible even in the complexes, and its apex does not bind with KD1 tightly. The interactions between this unique 60-loop and KD1 may provide an opportunity to increase the specificity and inhibitory activity of KD1 for matriptase. Furthermore, comparison between KD1 and a homology model of HAI-1 KD2 rationalizes the structural basis of why KD1 but not KD2 is responsible for the inhibitory activity of HAI-1 against matriptase.</p>

<p>New insecticides are urgently needed because resistance to current insecticides allows resurgence of disease-transmitting mosquitoes while concerns for human toxicity from current compounds are growing. We previously reported the finding of a free cysteine (Cys) residue at the entrance of the active site of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in some insects but not in mammals, birds, and fish. These insects have two AChE genes (AP and AO), and only AP-AChE carries the Cys residue. Most of these insects are disease vectors such as the African malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto) or crop pests such as aphids. Recently we reported a Cys-targeting small molecule that irreversibly inhibited all AChE activity extracted from aphids while an identical exposure caused no effect on the human AChE. Full inhibition of AChE in aphids indicates that AP-AChE contributes most of the enzymatic activity and suggests that the Cys residue might serve as a target for developing better aphicides. It is therefore worth investigating whether the Cys-targeting strategy is applicable to mosquitocides. Herein, we report that, under conditions that spare the human AChE, a methanethiosulfonate-containing molecule at 6 microM irreversibly inhibited 95% of the AChE activity extracted from An. gambiae s. str. and &gt;80% of the activity from the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti L.) or the northern house mosquito (Culex pipiens L.) that is a vector of St. Louis encephalitis. This type of inhibition is fast ( approximately 30 min) and due to conjugation of the inhibitor to the active-site Cys of mosquito AP-AChE, according to our observed reactivation of the methanethiosulfonate-inhibited AChE by 2-mercaptoethanol. We also note that our sulfhydryl agents partially and irreversibly inhibited the human AChE after prolonged exposure (&gt;4 hr). This slow inhibition is due to partial enzyme denaturation by the inhibitor and/or micelles of the inhibitor, according to our studies using atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. These results support our view that the mosquito-specific Cys is a viable target for developing new mosquitocides to control disease vectors and to alleviate resistance problems with reduced toxicity toward non-target species.</p>

<p>Glycosynthases are precise molecular instruments for making specifically linked oligosaccharides. X-ray crystallography screening of ligands bound to the 1,3(4)-beta-D-glucanase nucleophile mutant E115S of Phanerochaete chrysosporium Laminarinase 16A (Lam16A) showed that laminariheptaose (L7) bound in an arch with the reducing and nonreducing ends occupying either side of the catalytic cleft of the enzyme. The X-ray structure of Lam16A E115S in complex with alpha-laminariheptaosyl fluoride (alphaL7F) revealed how alphaL7F could make a nucleophilic attack upon itself. Indeed, when Lam16A E115S was allowed to react with alphaL7F the major product was a cyclic beta-1,3-heptaglucan, as shown by mass spectrometry. NMR confirmed uniquely beta-1,3-linkages and no reducing end. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the cyclic laminariheptaose molecule is not completely planar and that torsion angles at the glycosidic linkages fluctuate between two energy minima. This is the first report of a glycosynthase that joins the reducing and nonreducing ends of a single oligosaccharide and the first reported synthesis of cyclic beta-glucan.</p>

<p>JC virus is a member of the Polyomavirus family of DNA tumor viruses and the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a disease that occurs primarily in people who are immunocompromised and is usually fatal. As with other Polyomavirus family members, the replication of JC virus (JCV) DNA is dependent upon the virally encoded protein T-antigen. To further our understanding of JCV replication, we have determined the crystal structure of the origin-binding domain (OBD) of JCV T-antigen. This structure provides the first molecular understanding of JCV T-ag replication functions; for example, it suggests how the JCV T-ag OBD site-specifically binds to the major groove of GAGGC sequences in the origin. Furthermore, these studies suggest how the JCV OBDs interact during subsequent oligomerization events. We also report that the OBD contains a novel "pocket"; which sequesters the A1 &amp; B2 loops of neighboring molecules. Mutagenesis of a residue in the pocket associated with the JCV T-ag OBD interfered with viral replication. Finally, we report that relative to the SV40 OBD, the surface of the JCV OBD contains one hemisphere that is highly conserved and one that is highly variable. </p>

<p>Folic acid is an essential vitamin for normal cell growth, primarily through its central role in one-carbon metabolism. Folate analogs (antifolates) are targeted at the same reactions and are widely used as therapeutic drugs for cancer and bacterial infections. Effective retention of folates in cells and the efficacy of antifolate drugs both depend upon the addition of a polyglutamate tail to the folate or antifolate molecule by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). The reaction mechanism involves the ATP-dependent activation of the free carboxylate group on the folate molecule to give an acyl phosphate intermediate, followed by attack by the incoming L-glutamate substrate. FPGS shares a number of structural and mechanistic details with the bacterial cell wall ligases MurD, MurE and MurF, and these enzymes, along with FPGS, form a subfamily of the ADP-forming amide bond ligase family. High-resolution crystallographic analyses of binary and ternary complexes of Lactobacillus casei FPGS reveal that binding of the first substrate (ATP) is not sufficient to generate an active enzyme. However, binding of folate as the second substrate triggers a large conformational change that activates FPGS and allows the enzyme to adopt a form that is then able to bind the third substrate, L-glutamate, and effect the addition of a polyglutamate tail to the folate.</p>

<p>Biosynthesis of UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylmuramic acid in bacteria is a committed step towards peptidoglycan production. In an NADPH- and FAD-dependent reaction, the UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate reductase (MurB) reduces UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate to UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylmuramic acid. We determined the three-dimensional structures of the ternary complex of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> MurB with FAD and NADP<sup>+</sup> in two crystal forms to resolutions of 2.2 and 2.1 Å, respectively, to investigate the structural basis of the first half-reaction, hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD. The nicotinamide ring of NADP<sup>+</sup> stacks against the <i>si</i> face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, suggesting an unusual mode of hydride transfer to flavin. Comparison with the structure of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> MurB complex with UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate shows that both substrates share the binding site located between two lobes of the substrate-binding domain III, consistent with a ping pong mechanism with sequential substrate binding. The nicotinamide and the enolpyruvyl moieties are strikingly well-aligned upon superimposition, both positioned for hydride transfer to and from FAD. However, flexibility of the substrate channel allows the non-reactive parts of the two substrates to bind in different conformations. A potassium ion in the active site may assist in substrate orientation and binding. These structural models should help in structure-aided drug design against MurB, which is essential for cell wall biogenesis and hence bacterial survival.</p>

<p>The multicopper oxidases couple the one-electron oxidation of four substrate molecules to the four electron reductive cleavage of the O-O bond of dioxygen. This reduction takes place at the trinuclear copper centre of the enzyme and the dioxygen approaches this centre through an entrance channel. In this channel, an acidic residue plays a key role in steering the dioxygen to the trinuclear copper site, providing protons for the catalytic reaction and giving overall stability to this site. In this study, the role of the Glu(498) residue, located within the entrance channel to the trinuclear copper centre, has been investigated in the binding and reduction of dioxygen by the CotA-laccase from Bacillus subtilis. The absence of an acidic group at the 498 residue, as in the E498T and E498L mutants, results in a severe catalytic impairment, higher than 99%, for the phenolic and non-phenolic substrates tested. The replacement of this glutamate by aspartate leads to an activity that is around 10% relative to that of the wild-type. Furthermore, while this latter mutant shows a similar K(m) value for dioxygen, the E498T and E498L mutants show a decreased affinity, when compared to the wild-type. X-ray structural and spectroscopic analysis (UV-visible, electron paramagnetic resonance and resonance Raman) reveal perturbations of the structural properties of the catalytic centres in the Glu(498) mutants when compared to the wild-type protein. Overall, the results strongly suggest that Glu(498) plays a key role in the protonation events that occur at the trinuclear centre and in its stabilization, controlling therefore the binding of dioxygen and its further reduction.</p>

<p>The ability to detect, characterize, and manipulate specific biomolecules in complex media is critical for understanding metabolic processes. Particularly important targets are oxygenases (cytochromes P450) involved in drug metabolism and many disease states, including liver and kidney dysfunction, neurological disorders, and cancer. We have found that Ru photosensitizers linked to P450 substrates specifically recognize submicromolar cytochrome P450(cam) in the presence of other heme proteins. In the P450:Ru-substrate conjugates, energy transfer to the heme dramatically accelerates the Ru-luminescence decay. The crystal structure of a P450(cam):Ru-adamantyl complex reveals access to the active center via a channel whose depth (Ru-Fe distance is 21 A) is virtually the same as that extracted from an analysis of the energy-transfer kinetics. Suitably constructed libraries of sensitizer-linked substrates could be employed to probe the steric and electronic properties of buried active sites.</p>

<p>Self-compartmentalizing proteases orchestrate protein turnover through an original architecture characterized by a central catalytic chamber. Here we report the first structure of an archaeal member of a new self-compartmentalizing protease family forming a cubic-shaped octamer with D(4) symmetry and referred to as CubicO. We solved the structure of the Pyrococcus abyssi Pab87 protein at 2.2 A resolution using the anomalous signal of the high-phasing-power lanthanide derivative Lu-HPDO3A. A 20 A wide channel runs through this supramolecular assembly of 0.4 MDa, giving access to a 60 A wide central chamber holding the eight active sites. Surprisingly, activity assays revealed that Pab87 degrades specifically d-amino acid containing peptides, which have never been observed in archaea. Genomic context of the Pab87 gene showed that it is surrounded by genes involved in the amino acid/peptide transport or metabolism. We propose that CubicO proteases are involved in the processing of d-peptides from environmental origins.</p>

<p>Human maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) is one of the two enzymes responsible for catalyzing the last glucose-releasing step in starch digestion. MGAM is anchored to the small-intestinal brush-border epithelial cells and contains two homologous glycosyl hydrolase family 31 catalytic subunits: an N-terminal subunit (NtMGAM) found near the membrane-bound end and a C-terminal luminal subunit (CtMGAM). In this study, we report the crystal structure of the human NtMGAM subunit in its apo form (to 2.0 A) and in complex with acarbose (to 1.9 A). Structural analysis of the NtMGAM-acarbose complex reveals that acarbose is bound to the NtMGAM active site primarily through side-chain interactions with its acarvosine unit, and almost no interactions are made with its glycone rings. These observations, along with results from kinetic studies, suggest that the NtMGAM active site contains two primary sugar subsites and that NtMGAM and CtMGAM differ in their substrate specificities despite their structural relationship. Additional sequence analysis of the CtMGAM subunit suggests several features that could explain the higher affinity of the CtMGAM subunit for longer maltose oligosaccharides. The results provide a structural basis for the complementary roles of these glycosyl hydrolase family 31 subunits in the bioprocessing of complex starch structures into glucose.</p>

<p>Some bacterial type II fatty-acid synthesis (FAS II) enzymes have been shown to be important candidates for drug discovery. The scientific and medical quest for new FAS II protein targets continues to stimulate research in this field. One of the possible additional candidates is the acyl-carrier-protein synthase (AcpS) enzyme. Its holo form post-translationally modifies the apo form of an acyl carrier protein (ACP), which assures the constant delivery of thioester intermediates to the discrete enzymes of FAS II. At the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases (CSGID), AcpSs from Staphylococcus aureus (AcpS(SA)), Vibrio cholerae (AcpS(VC)) and Bacillus anthracis (AcpS(BA)) have been structurally characterized in their apo, holo and product-bound forms, respectively. The structure of AcpS(BA) is emphasized because of the two 3',5'-adenosine diphosphate (3',5'-ADP) product molecules that are found in each of the three coenzyme A (CoA) binding sites of the trimeric protein. One 3',5'-ADP is bound as the 3',5'-ADP part of CoA in the known structures of the CoA-AcpS and 3',5'-ADP-AcpS binary complexes. The position of the second 3',5'-ADP has never been described before. It is in close proximity to the first 3',5'-ADP and the ACP-binding site. The coordination of two ADPs in AcpS(BA) may possibly be exploited for the design of AcpS inhibitors that can block binding of both CoA and ACP.</p>

<p>Organophosphorus compounds (OPs), such as nerve agents and a group of insecticides, irreversibly inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by a rapid phosphorylation of the catalytic Ser203 residue. The formed AChE-OP conjugate subsequently undergoes an elimination reaction, termed aging, that results in an enzyme completely resistant to oxime-mediated reactivation by medical antidotes. In this study, we present crystal structures of the non-aged and aged complexes between Mus musculus AChE (mAChE) and the nerve agents sarin, VX, and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and the OP-based insecticides methamidophos (MeP) and fenamiphos (FeP). Non-aged conjugates of MeP, sarin, and FeP and aged conjugates of MeP, sarin, and VX are very similar to the noninhibited apo conformation of AChE. A minor structural change in the side chain of His447 is observed in the non-aged conjugate of VX. In contrast, an extensive rearrangement of the acyl loop region (residues 287-299) is observed in the non-aged structure of DFP and in the aged structures of DFP and FeP. In the case of FeP, the relatively large substituents of the phosphorus atom are reorganized during aging, providing a structural support of an aging reaction that proceeds through a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom. The FeP aging rate constant is 14 times lower than the corresponding constant for the structurally related OP insecticide MeP, suggesting that tight steric constraints of the acyl pocket loop preclude the formation of a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate.</p>

<p>Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) is a source of endogenous H2S, a gaseous signaling molecule implicated in a wide range of physiological processes. The contribution of MST versus the other two H2S generators, cystathionine β-synthase and γ-cystathionase, has been difficult to evaluate because many studies on MST have been conducted at high pH and have used varied reaction conditions. In this study, we have expressed, purified, and crystallized human MST in the presence of the substrate 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP). The kinetics of H2S production by MST from 3-MP was studied at pH 7.4 in the presence of various physiological persulfide acceptors: cysteine, dihydrolipoic acid, glutathione, homocysteine, and thioredoxin, and in the presence of cyanide. The crystal structure of MST reveals a mixture of the product complex containing pyruvate and an active site cysteine persulfide (Cys(248)-SSH) and a nonproductive intermediate in which 3-MP is covalently linked via a disulfide bond to an active site cysteine. The crystal structure analysis allows us to propose a detailed mechanism for MST in which an Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad is positioned to activate the nucleophilic cysteine residue and participate in general acid-base chemistry, whereas our kinetic analysis indicates that thioredoxin is likely to be the major physiological persulfide acceptor for MST. </p>

<p>Bacterioferritin (BFR) is a bacterial member of the ferritin family that functions in iron metabolism and protects against oxidative stress. BFR differs from the mammalian protein in that it is comprised of 24 identical subunits and is able to bind 12 equivalents of heme at sites located between adjacent pairs of subunits. The mechanism by which iron enters the protein to form the dinuclear (ferroxidase) catalytic site present in every subunit and the mineralized iron core housed within the 24-mer is not well understood. To address this issue, the properties of a catalytically functional assembly variant (E128R/E135R) of Escherichia coli BFR are characterized by a combination of crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetics. The three-dimensional structure of the protein (1.8 A resolution) includes two ethylene glycol molecules located on either side of the dinuclear iron site. One of these ethylene glycol molecules is integrated into the surface of the protein that would normally be exposed to solvent, and the other is integrated into the surface of the protein that would normally face the iron core where it is surrounded by the anionic residues Glu(47), Asp(50), and Asp(126). We propose that the sites occupied by these ethylene glycol molecules define regions where iron interacts with the protein, and, in keeping with this proposal, ferroxidase activity decreases significantly when they are replaced with the corresponding amides.</p>

<p>Thymidylate kinase (TMPK) is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that catalyzes the reversible phosphoryltransfer between ATP and TMP to yield ADP and TDP. In addition to its vital role in supplying precursors for DNA synthesis, human TMPK has an important medical role participating in the activation of a number of anti-HIV prodrugs.</p>

<p>Human thymidylate synthase (hTS) was targeted through a virtual screening approach. The most optimal inhibitor identified, 2-{4-hydroxy-2-[(2-hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazono]-2,5-dihydrothiazol-5-yl}-N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)acetamide (5), showed a mixed-type inhibition pattern, with a K(i) of 1.3 μM and activity against ovarian cancer cell lines with the same potency as cisplatin. X-ray studies revealed that it binds the inactive enzyme conformation. This study is the first example of a nonpeptidic inhibitor that binds the inactive hTS and exhibits anticancer activity against ovarian cancer cells.</p>

<p>New structures of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcribing complexes reveal a likely key to transcription. The trigger loop swings beneath a correct nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) in the nucleotide addition site, closing off the active center and forming an extensive network of interactions with the NTP base, sugar, phosphates, and additional pol II residues. A histidine side chain in the trigger loop, precisely positioned by these interactions, may literally "trigger" phosphodiester bond formation. Recognition and catalysis are thus coupled, ensuring the fidelity of transcription.</p>

<p>Sialic acids are essential components of membrane glycoconjugates. They are responsible for the interaction, structure, and functionality of all deuterostome cells and have major functions in cellular processes in health and diseases. The key enzyme of the biosynthesis of sialic acid is the bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase that transforms UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) followed by its phosphorylation to ManNAc 6-phosphate and has a direct impact on the sialylation of cell surface components. Here, we present the crystal structures of the human N-acetylmannosamine kinase (MNK) domain of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase in complexes with ManNAc at 1.64 Å resolution, MNK·ManNAc·ADP (1.82 Å) and MNK·ManNAc 6-phosphate · ADP (2.10 Å). Our findings offer detailed insights in the active center of MNK and serve as a structural basis to design inhibitors. We synthesized a novel inhibitor, 6-O-acetyl-ManNAc, which is more potent than those previously tested. Specific inhibitors of sialic acid biosynthesis may serve to further study biological functions of sialic acid.</p>

<p>UDP-3-O-((R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC) is a zinc-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the deacetylation of UDP-3-O-((R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine to form UDP-3-O-(R-hydroxymyristoyl)glucosamine and acetate. The structural similarity of the active site of LpxC to metalloproteases led to the proposal that LpxC functions via a metalloprotease-like mechanism. The pH dependence of k(cat)/Km catalyzed by Escherichia coli and Aquifex aeolicus LpxC displayed a bell-shaped curve (EcLpxC yields apparent pKa values of 6.4+/-0.1 and 9.1+/-0.1), demonstrating that at least two ionizations are important for maximal activity. Metal substitution and mutagenesis experiments suggest that the basic limb of the pH profile is because of deprotonation of a zinc-coordinated group such as the zinc-water molecule, whereas the acidic limb of the pH profile is caused by protonation of either Glu78 or His265. Furthermore, the magnitude of the activity decreases and synergy observed for the active site mutants suggest that Glu78 and His265 act as a general acid-base catalyst pair. Crystal structures of LpxC complexed with cacodylate or palmitate demonstrate that both Glu78 and His265 hydrogen-bond with the same oxygen atom of the tetrahedral intermediate and the product carboxylate. These structural features suggest that LpxC catalyzes deacetylation by using Glu78 and His265 as a general acid-base pair and the zinc-bound water as a nucleophile.</p>

<p>DNA polymerase β (pol β) is responsible for gap filling synthesis during repair of damaged DNA as part of the base excision repair pathway. Human pol β mutations were recently identified in a high percentage (∼30%) of tumors. Characterization of specific cancer variants is particularly useful to further the understanding of the general mechanism of pol β while providing context to disease contribution. We showed that expression of the carcinoma variant E295K induces cellular transformation. The poor polymerase activity exhibited by the variant was hypothesized to be caused by the destabilization of proper active site assembly by the glutamate to lysine mutation. Here, we show that this variant exhibits an unusual preference for binding dCTP opposite a templating adenine over the cognate dTTP. Biochemical studies indicate that the noncognate competes with the cognate nucleotide for binding to the polymerase active site with the noncognate incorporation a function of higher affinity and not increased activity. In the crystal structure of the variant bound to dA:dCTP, the fingers domain closes around the mismatched base pair. Nucleotide incorporation is hindered because key residues in the polymerase active site are not properly positioned for nucleotidyl transfer. In contrast to the noncognate dCTP, neither the cognate dTTP nor its nonhydrolyzable analog induced fingers closure, as isomorphous difference Fourier maps show that the cognate nucleotides are bound to the open state of the polymerase. Comparison with published structures provides insight into the structural rearrangements within pol β that occur during the process of nucleotide discrimination. </p>

<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encodes an aspartic protease (PR) that cleaves viral polyproteins into mature proteins, thus leading to the formation of infectious particles. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are successful virostatics. However, their efficiency is compromised by antiviral resistance. In the PR sequence of viral variants resistant to the PI nelfinavir, the mutations D30N and L90M appear frequently. However, these two mutations are seldom found together in vivo, suggesting that there are two alternative evolutionary pathways leading to nelfinavir resistance. Here we analyze the proteolytic activities, X-ray structures, and thermodynamics of inhibitor binding to HIV-1 PRs harboring the D30N and L90M mutations alone and in combination with other compensatory mutations. Vitality values obtained for recombinant mutant proteases and selected PR inhibitors confirm the crucial role of mutations in positions 30 and 90 for nelfinavir resistance. The combination of the D30N and L90M mutations significantly increases the enzyme vitality in the presence of nelfinavir, without a dramatic decrease in the catalytic efficiency of the recombinant enzyme. Crystal structures, molecular dynamics simulations, and calorimetric data for four mutants (D30N, D30N/A71V, D30N/N88D, and D30N/L90M) were used to augment our kinetic data. Calorimetric analysis revealed that the entropic contribution to the mutant PR/nelfinavir interaction is less favorable than the entropic contribution to the binding of nelfinavir by wild-type PR. This finding is supported by the structural data and simulations; nelfinavir binds most strongly to the wild-type protease, which has the lowest number of protein-ligand hydrogen bonds and whose structure exhibits the greatest degree of fluctuation upon inhibitor binding.</p>

<p>The enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is involved in the pathogenicity of Shigellae. As the crystal structure of this protein is known, it is a putative target for the structure-based design of inhibitors. Here we report a crystallographic study of several new ligands exhibiting a 2,6-diamino-3H-quinazolin-4-one scaffold, which has been shown recently to be a promising template for TGT-inhibitors. Crystal structure analysis of these complexes has revealed an unexpected movement of the side-chain of Asp102. A detailed analysis of the water network disrupted by this rotation has lead to the derivation of a new composite pharmacophore. A virtual screening has been performed based on this pharmacophore hypothesis and several new inhibitors of micromolar binding affinity with new skeletons have been discovered.</p>

<p>Comparison of the architecture around the active site of soybean beta-amylase and Bacillus cereus beta-amylase showed that the hydrogen bond networks (Glu380-(Lys295-Met51) and Glu380-Asn340-Glu178) in soybean beta-amylase around the base catalytic residue, Glu380, seem to contribute to the lower pH optimum of soybean beta-amylase. To convert the pH optimum of soybean beta-amylase (pH 5.4) to that of the bacterial type enzyme (pH 6.7), three mutants of soybean beta-amylase, M51T, E178Y, and N340T, were constructed such that the hydrogen bond networks were removed by site-directed mutagenesis. The kinetic analysis showed that the pH optimum of all mutants shifted dramatically to a neutral pH (range, from 5.4 to 6.0-6.6). The Km values of the mutants were almost the same as that of soybean beta-amylase except in the case of M51T, while the Vmax values of all mutants were low compared with that of soybean beta-amylase. The crystal structure analysis of the wild type-maltose and mutant-maltose complexes showed that the direct hydrogen bond between Glu380 and Asn340 was completely disrupted in the mutants M51T, E178Y, and N340T. In the case of M51T, the hydrogen bond between Glu380 and Lys295 was also disrupted. These results indicated that the reduced pKa value of Glu380 is stabilized by the hydrogen bond network and is responsible for the lower pH optimum of soybean beta-amylase compared with that of the bacterial beta-amylase.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the complex between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease and a peptidomimetic inhibitor of ethyleneamine type has been refined to R factor of 0.178 with diffraction limit 2.5 A. The peptidomimetic inhibitor Boc-Phe-Psi[CH2CH2NH]-Phe-Glu-Phe-NH2 (denoted here as OE) contains the ethyleneamine replacement of the scissile peptide bond. The inhibitor lacks the hydroxyl group which is believed to mimic tetrahedral transition state of proteolytic reaction and thus is suspected to be necessary for good properties of peptidomimetic HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Despite the missing hydroxyl group the inhibition constant of OE is 1.53 nm and it remains in the nanomolar range also towards several available mutants of HIV-1 protease. The inhibitor was found in the active site of protease in an extended conformation with a unique hydrogen bond pattern different from hydroxyethylene and hydroxyethylamine inhibitors. The isostere nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond to one catalytic aspartate only. The other aspartate forms two weak hydrogen bridges to the ethylene group of the isostere. A comparison with other inhibitors of this series containing isostere hydroxyl group in R or S configuration shows different ways of accommodation of inhibitor in the active site. Special attention is devoted to intermolecular contacts between neighbouring dimers responsible for mutual protein adhesion and for a special conformation of Met46 and Phe53 side chains not expected for free protein in water solution.</p>

<p>Oxalacetate acetylhydrolase (OAH), a member of the phosphoenolpyruvate mutase/isocitrate lyase superfamily, catalyzes the hydrolysis of oxalacetate to oxalic acid and acetate. This study shows that knock-out of the oah gene in Cryphonectria parasitica, the chestnut blight fungus, reduces the ability of the fungus to form cankers on chestnut trees, suggesting that OAH plays a key role in virulence. OAH was produced in Escherichia coli and purified, and its catalytic rates were determined. Oxalacetate is the main OAH substrate, but the enzyme also acts as a lyase of (2R,3S)-dimethyl malate with approximately 1000-fold lower efficacy. The crystal structure of OAH was determined alone, in complex with a mechanism-based inhibitor, 3,3-difluorooxalacetate (DFOA), and in complex with the reaction product, oxalate, to a resolution limit of 1.30, 1.55, and 1.65 A, respectively. OAH assembles into a dimer of dimers with each subunit exhibiting an (alpha/beta)(8) barrel fold and each pair swapping the 8th alpha-helix. An active site "gating loop" exhibits conformational disorder in the ligand-free structure. To obtain the structures of the OAH.ligand complexes, the ligand-free OAH crystals were soaked briefly with DFOA or oxalacetate. DFOA binding leads to ordering of the gating loop in a conformation that sequesters the ligand from the solvent. DFOA binds in a gem-diol form analogous to the oxalacetate intermediate/transition state. Oxalate binds in a planar conformation, but the gating loop is largely disordered. Comparison between the OAH structure and that of the closely related enzyme, 2,3-dimethylmalate lyase, suggests potential determinants of substrate preference.</p>

<p>SpHex, a retaining family 20 glycosidase from Streptomyces plicatus, catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminides. Accumulating evidence suggests that the hydrolytic mechanism involves substrate-assisted catalysis wherein the 2-acetamido substituent acts as a nucleophile to form an oxazolinium ion intermediate. The role of a conserved aspartate residue (D313) in the active site of SpHex was investigated through kinetic and structural analyses of two variant enzymes, D313A and D313N. Three-dimensional structures of the wild-type and variant enzymes in product complexes with N-acetyl-d-glucosamine revealed substantial differences. In the D313A variant the 2-acetamido group was found in two conformations of which only one is able to aid in catalysis through anchimeric assistance. The mutation D313N results in a steric clash in the active site between Asn-313 and the 2-acetamido group preventing the 2-acetamido group from providing anchimeric assistance, consistent with the large reduction in catalytic efficiency and the insensitivity of this variant to chemical rescue. By comparison, the D313A mutation results in a shift in a shift in the pH optimum and a modest decrease in activity that can be rescued by using azide as an exogenous nucleophile. These structural and kinetic data provide evidence that Asp-313 stabilizes the transition states flanking the oxazoline intermediate and also assists to correctly orient the 2-acetamido group for catalysis. Based on analogous conserved residues in the family 18 chitinases and family 56 hyaluronidases, the roles played by the Asp-313 residue is likely general for all hexosaminidases using a mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis.</p>

<p>DNA polymerase μ (Pol μ) is the only template-dependent human DNA polymerase capable of repairing double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) with unpaired 3' ends in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). To probe this function, we structurally characterized Pol μ's catalytic cycle for single-nucleotide incorporation. These structures indicate that, unlike other template-dependent DNA polymerases, Pol μ shows no large-scale conformational changes in protein subdomains, amino acid side chains or DNA upon dNTP binding or catalysis. Instead, the only major conformational change is seen earlier in the catalytic cycle, when the flexible loop 1 region repositions upon DNA binding. Pol μ variants with changes in loop 1 have altered catalytic properties and are partially defective in NHEJ. The results indicate that specific loop 1 residues contribute to Pol μ's unique ability to catalyze template-dependent NHEJ of DSBs with unpaired 3' ends. </p>

<p>Glutathione synthase catalyzes the final ATP-dependent step in glutathione biosynthesis, the formation of glutathione from gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine. We have determined structures of yeast glutathione synthase in two forms: unbound (2.3 A resolution) and bound to its substrate gamma-glutamylcysteine, the ATP analog AMP-PNP, and two magnesium ions (1.8 A resolution). These structures reveal that upon substrate binding, large domain motions convert the enzyme from an open unliganded form to a closed conformation in which protein domains completely surround the substrate in the active site.</p>

<p>A novel series of P1 modified HIV protease inhibitors was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antiviral activity against wild-type virus and protease inhibitor-resistant viruses. Optimization of the P1 moiety resulted in compounds with femtomolar enzyme activities and cellular antiviral activities in the low nanomolar range culminating in the identification of clinical candidate GW0385.</p>

<p>The two homologous proteins ribonuclease A and onconase fold through conserved initial contacts but differ significantly in their thermodynamic stability. A disulfide bond is located in the folding initiation site of onconase (the C-terminal part of the protein molecule) that is missing in ribonuclease A, whereas the other three disulfide bonds of onconase are conserved in ribonuclease A. Consequently, the deletion of this C-terminal disulfide bond (C87-C104) allows the impact of the contacts in this region on the folding of onconase to be studied. We found the C87A/C104A-onconase variant to be less active and less stable than the wild-type protein, whereas the tertiary structure, which was determined by both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, was only marginally affected. The folding kinetics of the variant, however, were found to be changed considerably in comparison to wild-type onconase. Proton exchange experiments in combination with two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy revealed differences in the native-state dynamics of the two proteins in the folding initiation site, which are held responsible for the changed folding mechanism. Likewise, the molecular dynamics simulation of the unfolding reaction indicated disparities for both proteins. Our results show that the high stability of onconase is based on the efficient stabilization of the folding initiation site by the C-terminal disulfide bond. The formation of the on-pathway intermediate, which is detectable during the folding of the wild-type protein and promotes the fast and efficient refolding reaction, requires the presence of this covalent bond.</p>

<p>The aspartic protease BACE2 is responsible for the shedding of the transmembrane protein Tmem27 from the surface of pancreatic β-cells, which leads to inactivation of the β-cell proliferating activity of Tmem27. This role of BACE2 in the control of β-cell maintenance suggests BACE2 as a drug target for diabetes. Inhibition of BACE2 has recently been shown to lead to improved control of glucose homeostasis and to increased insulin levels in insulin-resistant mice. BACE2 has 52% sequence identity to the well studied Alzheimer's disease target enzyme β-secretase (BACE1). High-resolution BACE2 structures would contribute significantly to the investigation of this enzyme as either a drug target or anti-target. Surface mutagenesis, BACE2-binding antibody Fab fragments, single-domain camelid antibody VHH fragments (Xaperones) and Fyn-kinase-derived SH3 domains (Fynomers) were used as crystallization helpers to obtain the first high-resolution structures of BACE2. Eight crystal structures in six different packing environments define an ensemble of low-energy conformations available to the enzyme. Here, the different strategies used for raising and selecting BACE2 binders for cocrystallization are described and the crystallization success, crystal quality and the time and resources needed to obtain suitable crystals are compared.</p>

<p>The x-ray crystal structures of trans-cinnamoyl-subtilisin, an acyl-enzyme covalent intermediate of the serine protease subtilisin Carlsberg, have been determined to 2.2-A resolution in anhydrous acetonitrile and in water. The cinnamoyl-subtilisin structures are virtually identical in the two solvents. In addition, their enzyme portions are nearly indistinguishable from previously determined structures of the free enzyme in acetonitrile and in water; thus, acylation in either aqueous or nonaqueous solvent causes no appreciable conformational changes. However, the locations of bound solvent molecules in the active site of the acyl- and free enzyme forms in acetonitrile and in water are distinct. Such differences in the active site solvation may contribute to the observed variations in enzymatic activities. On prolonged exposure to organic solvent or removal of interstitial solvent from the crystal lattice, the channels within enzyme crystals are shown to collapse, leading to a drop in the number of active sites accessible to the substrate. The mechanistic and preparative implications of our findings for enzymatic catalysis in organic solvents are discussed.</p>

<p>Cell walls of brown algae are complex supramolecular assemblies containing various original, sulfated, and carboxylated polysaccharides. Among these, the major marine polysaccharide component, alginate, represents an important biomass that is successfully turned over by the heterotrophic marine bacteria. In the marine flavobacterium Zobellia galactanivorans, the catabolism and uptake of alginate are encoded by operon structures that resemble the typical Bacteroidetes polysaccharide utilization locus. The genome of Z. galactanivorans contains seven putative alginate lyase genes, five of which are localized within two clusters comprising additional carbohydrate-related genes. This study reports on the detailed biochemical and structural characterization of two of these. We demonstrate here that AlyA1PL7 is an endolytic guluronate lyase, and AlyA5 cleaves unsaturated units, α-L-guluronate or β-D-manuronate residues, at the nonreducing end of oligo-alginates in an exolytic fashion. Despite a common jelly roll-fold, these striking differences of the mode of action are explained by a distinct active site topology, an open cleft in AlyA1(PL7), whereas AlyA5 displays a pocket topology due to the presence of additional loops partially obstructing the catalytic groove. Finally, in contrast to PL7 alginate lyases from terrestrial bacteria, both enzymes proceed according to a calcium-dependent mechanism suggesting an exquisite adaptation to their natural substrate in the context of brown algal cell walls.</p>

<p>DEAD-box RNA helicases play various, often critical, roles in all processes where RNAs are involved. Members of this family of proteins are linked to human disease, including cancer and viral infections. DEAD-box proteins contain two conserved domains that both contribute to RNA and ATP binding. Despite recent advances the molecular details of how these enzymes convert chemical energy into RNA remodeling is unknown. We present crystal structures of the isolated DEAD-domains of human DDX2A/eIF4A1, DDX2B/eIF4A2, DDX5, DDX10/DBP4, DDX18/myc-regulated DEAD-box protein, DDX20, DDX47, DDX52/ROK1, and DDX53/CAGE, and of the helicase domains of DDX25 and DDX41. Together with prior knowledge this enables a family-wide comparative structural analysis. We propose a general mechanism for opening of the RNA binding site. This analysis also provides insights into the diversity of DExD/H- proteins, with implications for understanding the functions of individual family members.</p>

<p>The X-ray crystal structures of covalent complexes of the Actinomadura R39 dd-peptidase and Escherichia coli penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 with beta-lactams bearing peptidoglycan-mimetic side chains have been determined. The structure of the hydrolysis product of an analogous peptide bound noncovalently to the former enzyme has also been obtained. The R39 DD-peptidase structures reveal the presence of a specific binding site for the D-alpha-aminopimelyl side chain, characteristic of the stem peptide of Actinomadura R39. This binding site features a hydrophobic cleft for the pimelyl methylene groups and strong hydrogen bonding to the polar terminus. Both of these active site elements are provided by amino acid side chains from two separate domains of the protein. In contrast, no clear electron density corresponding to the terminus of the peptidoglycan-mimetic side chains is present when these beta-lactams are covalently bound to PBP5. There is, therefore, no indication of a specific side-chain binding site in this enzyme. These results are in agreement with those from kinetics studies published earlier and support the general prediction made at the time of a direct correlation between kinetics and structural evidence. The essential high-molecular-mass PBPs have demonstrated, to date, no specific reactivity with peptidoglycan-mimetic peptide substrates and beta-lactam inhibitors and, thus, probably do not possess a specific substrate-binding site of the type demonstrated here with the R39 DD-peptidase. This striking deficiency may represent a sophisticated defense mechanism against low-molecular-mass substrate-analogue inhibitors/antibiotics; its discovery should focus new inhibitor design.</p>

<p>Some trypsin-like proteases are endowed with Na(+)-dependent allosteric enhancement of catalytic activity, but this important mechanism has been difficult to engineer in other members of the family. Replacement of 19 amino acids in Streptomyces griseus trypsin targeting the active site and the Na(+)-binding site were found necessary to generate efficient Na(+) activation. Remarkably, this property was linked to the acquisition of a new substrate selectivity profile similar to that of factor Xa, a Na(+)-activated protease involved in blood coagulation. The X-ray crystal structure of the mutant trypsin solved to 1.05 A resolution defines the engineered Na(+) site and active site loops in unprecedented detail. The results demonstrate that trypsin can be engineered into an efficient allosteric protease, and that Na(+) activation is interwoven with substrate selectivity in the trypsin scaffold.</p>

<p>Inhibitor resistant (IR) class A β-lactamases pose a significant threat to many current antibiotic combinations. The K234R substitution in the SHV β-lactamase, from  Klebsiella pneumoniae , results in resistance to ampicillin/clavulanate. After site-saturation mutagenesis of Lys-234 in SHV, microbiological and biochemical characterization of the resulting β-lactamases revealed that only -Arg conferred resistance to ampicillin/clavulanate. X-ray crystallography revealed two conformations of Arg-234 and Ser-130 in SHV K234R. The movement of Ser-130 is the principal cause of the observed clavulanate resistance. A panel of boronic acid inhibitors was designed and tested against SHV-1 and SHV K234R. A chiral ampicillin analogue was discovered to have a 2.4 ± 0.2 nM K(i) for SHV K234R; the chiral ampicillin analogue formed a more complex hydrogen-bonding network in SHV K234R vs SHV-1. Consideration of the spatial position of Ser-130 and Lys-234 and this hydrogen-bonding network will be important in the design of novel antibiotics targeting IR β-lactamases.</p>

<p>A novel ligand-binding site with functional implications has been identified in phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)). The binding of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin at this site blocks both catalytic and anti-coagulant actions of PLA(2). A group IIA PLA(2) has been isolated from Daboia russelli pulchella (Russell's viper) which is enzymatically active as well as induces a strong anti-coagulant action. The binding studies have shown that indomethacin reduces the effects of both anti-coagulant and pro-inflammatory actions of PLA(2). A group IIA PLA(2) was co-crystallized with indomethacin and the structure of the complex has been determined at 1.4 A resolution. The structure determination has revealed the presence of an indomethacin molecule in the structure of PLA(2) at a site which is distinct from the conventional substrate-binding site. One of the carboxylic group oxygen atoms of indomethacin interacts with Asp 49 and His 48 through the catalytically important water molecule OW 18 while the second carboxylic oxygen atom forms an ionic interaction with the side chain of Lys 69. It is well known that the residues, His 48 and Asp 49 are essential for catalysis while Lys 69 is a part of the anti-coagulant loop (residues, 54-77). Indomethacin binds in such a manner that it blocks the access to both, it works as a dual inhibitor for catalytic and anti-coagulant actions of PLA(2). This new binding site in PLA(2) has been observed for the first time and indomethacin is the first compound that has been shown to bind at this novel site resulting in the prevention of anti-coagulation and inflammation.</p>

<p>Lipopolysaccharides constitute the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and are therefore essential for cell growth and viability. The heptosyltransferase WaaC is a glycosyltransferase (GT) involved in the synthesis of the inner core region of LPS. It catalyzes the addition of the first L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (heptose) molecule to one 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) residue of the Kdo2-lipid A molecule. Heptose is an essential component of the LPS core domain; its absence results in a truncated lipopolysaccharide associated with the deep-rough phenotype causing a greater susceptibility to antibiotic and an attenuated virulence for pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, WaaC represents a promising target in antibacterial drug design. Here, we report the structure of WaaC from the Escherichia coli pathogenic strain RS218 alone at 1.9 A resolution, and in complex with either ADP or the non-cleavable analog ADP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-heptose of the sugar donor at 2.4 A resolution. WaaC adopts the GT-B fold in two domains, characteristic of one glycosyltransferase structural superfamily. The comparison of the three different structures shows that WaaC does not undergo a domain rotation, characteristic of the GT-B family, upon substrate binding, but allows the substrate analog and the reaction product to adopt remarkably distinct conformations inside the active site. In addition, both binary complexes offer a close view of the donor subsite and, together with results from site-directed mutagenesis studies, provide evidence for a model of the catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>The x-ray crystal structure of NifV(-) Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase MoFe protein (NifV(-) Kp1) has been determined and refined to a resolution of 1.9 A. This is the first structure for a nitrogenase MoFe protein with an altered cofactor. Moreover, it is the first direct evidence that the organic acid citrate is not just present, but replaces homocitrate as a ligand to the molybdenum atom of the iron molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco). Subsequent refinement of the structure revealed that the citrate was present at reduced occupancy.</p>

<p>Enzymes from psychrophilic organisms differ from their mesophilic counterparts in having a lower thermostability and a higher specific activity at low and moderate temperatures. The current consensus is that they have an increased flexibility, enhancing accommodation and transformation of the substrates at low energy costs. Here we describe the structure of the xylanase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis at 1.3 A resolution. Xylanases are usually grouped into glycosyl hydrolase families 10 and 11, but this enzyme belongs to family 8. The fold differs from that of other known xylanases and can be described as an (alpha/alpha)(6) barrel. Various parameters that may explain the cold-adapted properties were examined and indicated that the protein has a reduced number of salt bridges and an increased exposure of hydrophobic residues. The crystal structures of a complex with xylobiose and of mutant D144N were obtained at 1.2 and 1.5 A resolution, respectively. Analysis of the various substrate binding sites shows that the +3 and -3 subsites are rearranged as compared to those of a family 8 homolog, while the xylobiose complex suggests the existence of a +4 subsite. A decreased acidity of the substrate binding cleft and an increased flexibility of aromatic residues lining the subsites may enhance the rate at which substrate is bound.</p>

<p>Xenobiotic reductase A (XenA) from Pseudomonas putida 86 catalyzes the NADH/NADPH-dependent reduction of various substrates, including 2-cyclohexenone and 8-hydroxycoumarin. XenA is a member of the old yellow enzyme (OYE) family of flavoproteins and is structurally and functionally similar to other bacterial members of this enzyme class. A characteristic feature of XenA is the presence of a cysteine residue (Cys25) in the active site, where in most members of the OYE family a threonine residue is found that modulates the reduction potential of the FMN/FMNH(-) couple. We investigated the role of Cys25 by studying two variants in which the residue has been exchanged for a serine and an alanine residue. While the exchange against alanine has a remarkably small effect on the reduction potential, the reactivity and the structure of XenA, the exchange against serine increases the reduction potential by +82 mV, increases the rate constant of the reductive half-reaction and decreases the rate constant in the oxidative half-reaction. We determined six crystal structures at high to true atomic resolution (d(min) 1.03-1.80 A) of the three XenA variants with and without the substrate coumarin bound in the active site. The atomic resolution structure of XenA in complex with coumarin reveals a compressed active site geometry in which the isoalloxazine ring is sandwiched between coumarin and the protein backbone. The structures further reveal that the conformation of the active site and substrate interactions are preserved in the two variants, indicating that the observed changes are due to local effects only. We propose that Cys25 and the residues in its place determine which of the two half-reactions is rate limiting, depending on the substrate couple. This might help to explain why the genome of Pseudomonas putida encodes multiple xenobiotic reductases containing either cysteine, threonine or alanine in the active site.</p>

<p>In P450cin, Tyr81, Asp241, Asn242, two water molecules, and the substrate participate in a complex H-bonded network. The role of this H-bonded network in substrate binding and catalysis has been probed by crystallography, spectroscopy, kinetics, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and molecular dynamics. For the Y81F mutant, the substrate binds about 20-fold more weakly and Vmax decreases by about 30% in comparison to WT. The enhanced susceptibility of the heme to H₂O₂-mediated destruction in Y81F suggests that this mutant favors the open, low-spin conformational state. Asn242 H-bonds directly with the substrate, and replacing this residue with Ala results in water taking the place of the missing Asn side chain. This mutant exhibits a 70% decrease in activity. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations of substrate-bound complexes show that the solvent has more ready access to the active site, especially for the N242A mutant. This accounts for about a 64% uncoupling of electron transfer from substrate hydroxylation. These data indicate the importance of the interconnected water network on substrate binding and on the open/closed conformational equilibrium, which are both critically important for maintaining high-coupling efficiency.</p>

<p>The cobalamin-independent methionine synthase from Candida albicans, known as Met6p, is a 90-kDa enzyme that consists of two (βα)8 barrels. The active site is located between the two domains and has binding sites for a zinc ion and substrates l-homocysteine and 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate-glutamate3. Met6p catalyzes transfer of the methyl group of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate-glutamate3 to the l-homocysteine thiolate to generate methionine. Met6p is essential for fungal growth, and we currently pursue it as an antifungal drug design target. Here we report the binding of l-homocysteine, methionine, and several folate analogs. We show that binding of l-homocysteine or methionine results in conformational rearrangements at the amino acid binding pocket, moving the catalytic zinc into position to activate the thiol group. We also map the folate binding pocket and identify specific binding residues, like Asn126, whose mutation eliminates catalytic activity. We also report the development of a robust fluorescence-based activity assay suitable for high-throughput screening. We use this assay and an X-ray structure to characterize methotrexate as a weak inhibitor of fungal Met6p. </p>

<p>The Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 (PbJDR2) has been shown to have novel properties in the utilization of the abundant but chemically complex hemicellulosic sugar glucuronoxylan. Xylanase A1 of PbJDR2 (PbXynA1) has been implicated in an efficient process in which extracellular depolymerization of this polysaccharide is coupled to assimilation and intracellular metabolism. PbXynA1is a 154kDa cell wall anchored multimodular glycosyl hydrolase family 10 (GH10) xylanase. In this work, the 38kDa catalytic module of PbXynA1 has been structurally characterized revealing several new features not previously observed in structures of GH10 xylanases. These features are thought to facilitate hydrolysis of highly substituted, chemically complex xylans that may be the form found in close proximity to the cell wall of PbJDR2, an organism shown to have a preference for growth on polymeric glucuronoxylan.</p>

<p>PII is a highly conserved regulatory protein found in organisms across the three domains of life. In cyanobacteria and plants, PII relieves the feedback inhibition of the rate-limiting step in arginine biosynthesis catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK). To understand the molecular structural basis of enzyme regulation by PII, we have determined a 2.5-A resolution crystal structure of a complex formed between two homotrimers of PII and a single hexamer of NAGK from Arabidopsis thaliana bound to the metabolites N-acetylglutamate, ADP, ATP, and arginine. In PII, the T-loop and Trp(22) at the start of the alpha1-helix, which are both adjacent to the ATP-binding site of PII, contact two beta-strands as well as the ends of two central helices (alphaE and alphaG) in NAGK, the opposing ends of which form major portions of the ATP and N-acetylglutamate substrate-binding sites. The binding of Mg(2+).ATP to PII stabilizes a conformation of the T-loop that favors interactions with both open and closed conformations of NAGK. Interactions between PII and NAGK appear to limit the degree of opening and closing of the active-site cleft in opposition to a domain-separating inhibitory effect exerted by arginine, thus explaining the stimulatory effect of PII on the kinetics of arginine-inhibited NAGK.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Delta3-Delta2-enoyl-CoA isomerase from human mitochondria (hmEci), complexed with the substrate analogue octanoyl-CoA, has been refined at 1.3 A resolution. This enzyme takes part in the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids by converting both cis-3 and trans-3-enoyl-CoA esters (with variable length of the acyl group) to trans-2-enoyl-CoA. hmEci belongs to the hydratase/isomerase (crotonase) superfamily. Most of the enzymes belonging to this superfamily are hexamers, but hmEci is shown to be a trimer. The mode of binding of the ligand, octanoyl-CoA, shows that the omega-end of the acyl group binds in a hydrophobic tunnel formed by residues of the loop preceding helix H4 as well as by side-chains of the kinked helix H9. From the structure of the complex it can be seen that Glu136 is the only catalytic residue. The importance of Glu136 for catalysis is confirmed by mutagenesis studies. A cavity analysis shows the presence of two large, adjacent empty hydrophobic cavities near the active site, which are shaped by side-chains of helices H1, H2, H3 and H4. The structure comparison of hmEci with structures of other superfamily members, in particular of rat mitochondrial hydratase (crotonase) and yeast peroxisomal enoyl-CoA isomerase, highlights the variable mode of binding of the fatty acid moiety in this superfamily.</p>

<p>Relating thermodynamic parameters to structural and biochemical data allows a better understanding of substrate binding and its contribution to catalysis. The analysis of the binding of carbohydrates to proteins or enzymes is a special challenge because of the multiple interactions and forces involved. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) provides a direct measure of binding enthalpy (DeltaHa) and allows the determination of the binding constant (free energy), entropy, and stoichiometry. In this study, we used ITC to elucidate the binding thermodynamics of xylosaccharides for two xylanases of family 10 isolated from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6. The change in the heat capacity of binding (DeltaCp = DeltaH/DeltaT) for xylosaccharides differing in one sugar unit was determined by using ITC measurements at different temperatures. Because hydrophobic stacking interactions are associated with negative DeltaCp, the data allow us to predict the substrate binding preference in the binding subsites based on the crystal structure of the enzyme. The proposed positional binding preference was consistent with mutants lacking aromatic binding residues at different subsites and was also supported by tryptophan fluorescence analysis.</p>

<p>A bis-(-)-nor-meptazinol derivative in which the two meptazinol rings are linked by a nonamethylene spacer is a novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that inhibits both catalytic activity and Abeta peptide aggregation. The crystal structure of its complex with Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase was determined to 2.7 A resolution. The ligand spans the active-site gorge, with one nor-meptazinol moiety bound at the "anionic" subsite of the active site, disrupting the catalytic triad by forming a hydrogen bond with His440N(epsilon2), which is hydrogen-bonded to Ser200O(gamma) in the native enzyme. The second nor-meptazinol binds at the peripheral "anionic" site at the gorge entrance. A number of GOLD models of the complex, using both native TcAChE and the protein template from the crystal structure of the bis-(-)-nor-meptazinol/TcAChE complex, bear higher similarity to the X-ray structure than a previous model obtained using the mouse enzyme structure. These findings may facilitate rational design of new meptazinol-based acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.</p>

<p>The survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis depends on mycolic acids, very long α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids comprising 60-90 carbon atoms. However, despite considerable efforts, little is known about how enzymes involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis recognize and bind their hydrophobic fatty acyl substrates. The condensing enzyme KasA is pivotal for the synthesis of very long (C38-42) fatty acids, the precursors of mycolic acids. To probe the mechanism of substrate and inhibitor recognition by KasA, we determined the structure of this protein in complex with a mycobacterial phospholipid and with several thiolactomycin derivatives that were designed as substrate analogs. Our structures provide consecutive snapshots along the reaction coordinate for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction and support an induced fit mechanism in which a wide cavity is established through the concerted opening of three gatekeeping residues and several α-helices. The stepwise characterization of the binding process provides mechanistic insights into the induced fit recognition in this system and serves as an excellent foundation for the development of high affinity KasA inhibitors. </p>

<p>Streptogrisin B (SGPB) has served as one of the models for studying the catalytic activities of serine peptidases. Here we report its native crystal structures at pH 4.2 at a resolution of 1.18A, and at pH 7.3 at a resolution of 1.23A. Unexpectedly, outstanding electron density peaks occurred in the active site and the substrate-binding region of SGPB in the computed maps at both pHs. The densities at pH 4.2 were assigned as a tetrapeptide, Asp-Ala-Ile-Tyr, whereas those at pH 7.3 were assigned as a tyrosine molecule and a leucine molecule existing at equal occupancies in both of the SGPB molecules in the asymmetric unit. Refinement with relaxed geometric restraints resulted in molecular structures representing mixtures of the second tetrahedral intermediates and the enzyme-product complexes of SGPB existing in a pH-dependent equilibrium. Structural comparisons with the complexes of SGPB with turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3) and its variants have shown that, upon the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate, residues Glu192A to Gly193 of SGPB move towards the alpha-carboxylate O of residue P1 of the bound species, and adjustments in the side-chain conformational angles of His57 and Ser195 of SGPB favor the progression of the catalytic mechanism of SGPB.</p>

<p>Amine oxidases utilize a proton abstraction mechanism following binding of the amine substrate to the C5 position of the cofactor, the quinone form of trihydroxyphenylalanine (TPQ). Previous work [Wilmot, C. M., et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 1608-1620] has shown that Asp383 in Escherichia coliamine oxidase (ECAO) is the catalytic base which performs the key step of proton abstraction. This paper explores in more depth this and other roles of Asp383. The crystal structures of three mutational variants are presented together with their catalytic properties, visible spectra, and binding properties for a substrate-like inhibitor, 2-hydrazinopyridine (2-HP), in comparison to those of the wild type enzyme. In wild type ECAO, the TPQ is located in a wedge-shaped pocket which allows more freedom of movement at the substrate binding position (C5) than for TPQ ring carbons C1-C4. A role of Asp383, whose carboxylate is located close to O5, is to stabilize the TPQ in its major conformation in the pocket. Replacement of Asp383 with the isostructural, but chemically distinct, Asn383 does not affect the location or dynamics of the TPQ cofactor significantly, but eliminates catalytic activity and drastically reduces the affinity for 2-HP. Removal of the side chain carboxyl moiety, as in Ala383, additionally allows the TPQ the greater conformational flexibility to coordinate to the copper, which demonstrates that Asp383 helps maintain the active site structure by preventing TPQ from migrating to the copper. Glu383 has a greatly decreased catalytic activity, as well as a decreased affinity for 2-HP relative to that of wild type ECAO. The electron density reveals that the longer side chain of Glu prevents the pivotal motion of the TPQ by hindering its movement within the wedge-shaped active site pocket. The results show that Asp383 performs multiple roles in the catalytic mechanism of ECAO, not only in acting as the active site base at different stages of the catalytic cycle but also in regulating the mobility of the TPQ that is essential to catalysis.</p>

<p>As a mechanism-based inactivator of PLP-enzymes, (S)-4-amino-4,5-dihydro-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (SADTA) was cocrystallized with Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (l-AspAT) at a series of pH values ranging from 6 to 8. Five structural models with high resolution (1.4-1.85 A) were obtained for l-AspAT-SADTA complexes at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. Electron densities of the models showed that two different adducts had formed in the active sites. One adduct was formed from SADTA covalently linked to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) while the other adduct was formed with the inhibitor covalently linked to Lysine246,1 the active site lysine. Moreover, there is a strong indication based on the electron densities that the occurrence of the two adducts is pH dependent. We conclude that SADTA inactivates l-AspAT via two different mechanisms based on the binding direction of the inactivator. Additionally, the structural models also show pH dependence of the protein structure itself, which provided detailed mechanistic implications for l-AspAT.</p>

<p>Quinolinic acid (QA) is a neurotoxin and has been shown to be present at high levels in the central nervous system of patients with certain diseases, such as AIDS and meningitis. The enzyme quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRTase) provides the only route for QA metabolism and is also an essential step in de novo NAD biosynthesis. QAPRTase catalyzes the synthesis of nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) from QA and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). The structures of several phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTases) have been reported, and all have shown a similar fold of a five-strandard beta sheet surrounded by four alpha helices. A conserved sequence motif of 13 residues is common to these 'type I' PRTases but is not observed in the QAPRTase sequence, suggestive of a different fold for this enzyme.</p>

<p>IpaH proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligases delivered by the type III secretion apparatus into host cells upon infection of humans by the Gram-negative pathogen Shigella flexneri. These proteins comprise a variable leucine-rich repeat-containing N-terminal domain and a conserved C-terminal domain harboring an invariant cysteine residue that is crucial for activity. IpaH homologs are encoded by diverse animal and plant pathogens. Here we demonstrate that the IpaH C-terminal domain carries the catalytic activity for ubiquitin transfer and that the N-terminal domain carries the substrate specificity. The structure of the IpaH C-terminal domain, determined to 2.65-A resolution, represents an all-helical fold bearing no resemblance to previously defined E3 ubiquitin ligases. The conserved and essential cysteine residue lies on a flexible, surface-exposed loop surrounded by conserved acidic residues, two of which are crucial for IpaH activity.</p>

<p>The X-ray crystal structures were solved for complexes with Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase of two bivalent tacrine derivative compounds in which the two tacrine rings were separated by 5- and 7-carbon spacers. The derivative with the 7-carbon spacer spans the length of the active-site gorge, making sandwich interactions with aromatic residues both in the catalytic anionic site (Trp84 and Phe330) at the bottom of the gorge and at the peripheral anionic site near its mouth (Tyr70 and Trp279). The derivative with the 5-carbon spacer interacts in a similar manner at the bottom of the gorge, but the shorter tether precludes a sandwich interaction at the peripheral anionic site. Although the upper tacrine group does interact with Trp279, it displaces the phenyl residue of Phe331, thus causing a major rearrangement in the Trp279-Ser291 loop. The ability of this inhibitor to induce large-scale structural changes in the active-site gorge of acetylcholinesterase has significant implications for structure-based drug design because such conformational changes in the target enzyme are difficult to predict and to model.</p>

<p>Monoacylglycerol lipases (MGLs) play an important role in lipid catabolism across all kingdoms of life by catalyzing the release of free fatty acids from monoacylglycerols. The three-dimensional structures of human and a bacterial MGL were determined only recently as the first members of this lipase family. In addition to the α/β-hydrolase core, they showed unexpected structural similarities even in the cap region. Nevertheless, the structural basis for substrate binding and conformational changes of MGLs is poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive study of five crystal structures of MGL from Bacillus sp. H257 in its free form and in complex with different substrate analogs and the natural substrate 1-lauroylglycerol. The occurrence of different conformations reveals a high degree of conformational plasticity of the cap region. We identify a specific residue, Ile-145, that might act as a gatekeeper restricting access to the binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ile-145 leads to significantly reduced hydrolase activity. Bacterial MGLs in complex with 1-lauroylglycerol, myristoyl, palmitoyl, and stearoyl substrate analogs enable identification of the binding sites for the alkyl chain and the glycerol moiety of the natural ligand. They also provide snapshots of the hydrolytic reaction of a bacterial MGL at different stages. The alkyl chains are buried in a hydrophobic tunnel in an extended conformation. Binding of the glycerol moiety is mediated via Glu-156 and water molecules. Analysis of the structural features responsible for cap plasticity and the binding modes of the ligands suggests conservation of these features also in human MGL. </p>

<p>Enzymes are proficient catalysts that enable fast rates of Michaelis-complex formation, the chemical step and products release. These different steps may require different conformational states of the active site that have distinct binding properties. Moreover, the conformational flexibility of the active site mediates alternative, promiscuous functions. Here we focused on the lactonase SsoPox from Sulfolobus solfataricus. SsoPox is a native lactonase endowed with promiscuous phosphotriesterase activity. We identified a position in the active site loop (W263) that governs its flexibility, and thereby affects the substrate specificity of the enzyme. We isolated two different sets of substitutions at position 263 that induce two distinct conformational sampling of the active loop and characterized the structural and kinetic effects of these substitutions. These sets of mutations selectively and distinctly mediate the improvement of the promiscuous phosphotriesterase and oxo-lactonase activities of SsoPox by increasing active-site loop flexibility. These observations corroborate the idea that conformational diversity governs enzymatic promiscuity and is a key feature of protein evolvability. </p>

<p>Azoreductase 1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 (paAzoR1) catalyses the activation of the prodrug balsalazide and reduces the azo dye methyl red using reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor as an electron donor. To investigate the mechanism of the enzyme, a Y131F mutation was introduced and the enzymic properties of the mutant were compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. The crystallographic structure of the mutant with methyl red bound was solved at 2.1 A resolution and compared with the wild-type structure. Tyr131 is important in the architecture of the active site but is not essential for enzymic activity.</p>

<p>This paper focuses on the radiation-damage effects when applying the same total X-ray dose to protein crystals at different dose rates. These experiments have been performed on both a selenomethionated protein and on bovine trypsin using dose rates that span nearly two orders of magnitude. The results show no clear dose-rate effect on the global indicators of radiation damage, but a small measurable dose-rate effect could be found when studying specific radiation damage. It is hypothesized that this observed dose-rate effect relates to differences in the steady-state free-radical concentration.</p>

<p>An analysis of the binding of the 8-O-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-12-aminododecanoyl derivative of 8-O-debutanoylthapsigargin to the target molecule, the SERCA pump, has revealed the importance of the length and flexibility of the side chain attached to O-8. Based on the analysis a series of analogues to the 2-unsubstituted analogue trilobolide has been constructed and shown to be equipotent with thapsigargin as SERCA inhibitors. Only the 12-Boc-aminododecaonoyl derivative, however, was found to be apoptotic.</p>

<p>To identify specific bacterial thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors, we exploited phenolphthalein (PTH), which inhibits both bacterial and human enzymes. The X-ray crystal structure of Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS) that binds PTH showed multiple binding modes of the inhibitor, which prevented a classical structure-based drug design approach. To overcome this issue, we synthesized two phthalimidic libraries that were tested against TS enzymes and then we performed X-ray crystallographic screening of the active compounds. Compounds 6A, 8A, and 12A showed 40-fold higher affinity for bacterial TS than human TS. The X-ray crystallographic screening characterized the binding mode of six inhibitors in complexes with LcTS. Of these, 20A, 23A, and 24A showed a common unique binding mode, whereas 8A showed a different, unique binding mode. A comparative analysis of the LcTS X-ray complexes that were obtained with the pathogenic TS enabled the selection of compounds 8A and 23A as specific compounds and starting points to be exploited for the specific inhibition of pathogen enzymes.</p>

<p>We determined the structure of the complex of the sensory histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR) in the two-component signal transduction system of Thermotoga maritima. This was accomplished by fitting the high-resolution structures of the isolated HK domains and the RR onto the electron density map (3.8 A resolution) of the HK/RR complex crystal. Based on the structural information, we evaluated the roles of both interdomain and intermolecular interactions in the signal transduction of the cytosolic PAS-linked HK and RR system, in particular the O(2)-sensor FixL/FixJ system. The PAS-sensor domain of HK interacts with the catalytic domain of the same polypeptide chain by creating an interdomain beta sheet. The interaction site between HK and RR, which was confirmed by NMR, is suitable for the intermolecular transfer reaction of the phosphoryl group, indicating that the observed interaction is important for the phosphatase activity of HK that dephosphorylates phospho-RR.</p>

<p>The lytic transglycosylase MltE from Escherichia coli is a periplasmic, outer membrane-attached enzyme that cleaves the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in the cell wall peptidoglycan, producing 1,6-anhydromuropeptides. Here we report three crystal structures of MltE: in a substrate-free state, in a binary complex with chitopentaose, and in a ternary complex with the glycopeptide inhibitor bulgecin A and the murodipeptide N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylmuramyl-l-Ala-d-Glu. The substrate-bound structures allowed a detailed analysis of the saccharide-binding interactions in six subsites of the peptidoglycan-binding groove (subsites -4 to +2) and, combined with site-directed mutagenesis analysis, confirmed the role of Glu64 as catalytic acid/base. The structures permitted the precise modeling of a short glycan strand of eight saccharide residues, providing evidence for two additional subsites (+3 and +4) and revealing the productive conformational state of the substrate at subsites -1 and +1, where the glycosidic bond is cleaved. Full accessibility of the peptidoglycan-binding groove and preferential binding of an N-acetylmuramic acid residue in a (4)C(1) chair conformation at subsite +2 explain why MltE shows only endo- and no exo-specific activity toward glycan strands. The results further indicate that catalysis of glycosidic bond cleavage by MltE proceeds via distortion toward a sofa-like conformation of the N-acetylmuramic acid sugar ring at subsite -1 and by anchimeric assistance of the sugar's N-acetyl group, as shown previously for the lytic transglycosylases Slt70 and MltB.</p>

<p>The first crystallographic structures of a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from a Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus opacus 1CP (Rho 1,2-CTD), a Fe(III) ion containing enzyme specialized in the aerobic biodegradation of catechols, and its adducts with catechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrogallol (benzene-1,2,3-triol), 3-chlorocatechol, 4-chlorocatechol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate) have been determined and analyzed. This study represents the first extensive characterization of catechols adducts of 1,2-CTDs. The structural analyses reveal the diverse modes of binding to the active metal iron ion of the tested catechols thus allowing to identify the residues selectively involved in recognition of the diverse substrates by this class of enzymes. The comparison is further extended to the structural and functional characteristics of the other 1,2-CTDs isolated from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover the high structural homology of the present enzyme with the 3-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from the same bacterium are discussed in terms of their different substrate specificity. The catalytic rates for Rho 1,2-CTD conversion of the tested compounds are also compared with the calculated energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (E(HOMO)) of the substrates. A quantitative relationship (R=0.966) between the ln k(cat) and the calculated electronic parameter E(HOMO) was obtained for catechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrogallol, 3-chlorocatechol, 4-chlorocatechol. This indicates that for these substrates the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle is dependent on their nucleophilic reactivity. The discrepancies observed in the quantitative relationship for 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and protocatechuate are ascribed to the sterical hindrances leading to the distorted binding of such catechols observed in the corresponding structures.</p>

<p>Cyanophages infecting the marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus encode and express genes for the photosynthetic light reactions. Sequenced cyanophage genomes lack Calvin cycle genes, however, suggesting that photosynthetic energy harvested via phage proteins is not used for carbon fixation. We report here that cyanophages carry and express a Calvin cycle inhibitor, CP12, whose host homologue directs carbon flux from the Calvin cycle to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Phage CP12 was coexpressed with phage genes involved in the light reactions, deoxynucleotide biosynthesis, and the PPP, including a transaldolase gene that is the most prevalent PPP gene in cyanophages. Phage transaldolase was purified to homogeneity from several strains and shown to be functional in vitro, suggesting that it might facilitate increased flux through this key reaction in the host PPP, augmenting production of NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate. Kinetic measurements of phage and host transaldolases revealed that the phage enzymes have k(cat)/K(m) values only approximately one third of the corresponding host enzymes. The lower efficiency of phage transaldolase may be a tradeoff for other selective advantages such as reduced gene size: we show that more than half of host-like cyanophage genes are significantly shorter than their host homologues. Consistent with decreased Calvin cycle activity and increased PPP and light reaction activity under infection, the host NADPH/NADP ratio increased two-fold in infected cells. We propose that phage-augmented NADPH production fuels deoxynucleotide biosynthesis for phage replication, and that the selection pressures molding phage genomes involve fitness advantages conferred through mobilization of host energy stores.</p>

<p>The effect of the Y108V mutation of human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (hGST P1-1) on the binding of the diuretic drug ethacrynic acid (EA) and its glutathione conjugate (EASG) was investigated by calorimetric, spectrofluorimetric, and crystallographic studies. The mutation Tyr 108 --&gt; Val resulted in a 3D-structure very similar to the wild type (wt) enzyme, where both the hydrophobic ligand binding site (H-site) and glutathione binding site (G-site) are unchanged except for the mutation itself. However, due to a slight increase in the hydrophobicity of the H-site, as a consequence of the mutation, an increase in the entropy was observed. The Y108V mutation does not affect the affinity of EASG for the enzyme, which has a higher affinity (K(d) approximately 0.5 microM) when compared with those of the parent compounds, K(d) (EA) approximately 13 microM, K(d) (GSH) approximately 25 microM. The EA moiety of the conjugate binds in the H-site of Y108V mutant in a fashion completely different to those observed in the crystal structures of the EA or EASG wt complex structures. We further demonstrate that the Delta C(p) values of binding can also be correlated with the potential stacking interactions between ligand and residues located in the binding sites as predicted from crystal structures. Moreover, the mutation does not significantly affect the global stability of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that calorimetric measurements maybe useful in determining the preference of binding (the binding mode) for a drug to a specific site of the enzyme, even in the absence of structural information.</p>

<p>Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are redox proteins that use glutathione ((γ)Glu-Cys-Gly; GSH) as a cofactor. Plasmodium falciparum has one classic dithiol (CXXC) glutaredoxin (glutaredoxin 1; PfGrx1) and three monothiol (CXXS) Grx-like proteins (GLPs), which have five residue insertions prior to the active-site Cys. Here, the crystal structure of PfGrx1 has been determined by the sulfur single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (S-SAD) method utilizing intrinsic protein and solvent S atoms. Several residues were modelled with alternate conformations, and an alternate position was refined for the active-site Cys29 owing to radiation damage. The GSH-binding site is occupied by water polygons and buffer molecules. Structural comparison of PfGrx1 with other Grxs and Grx-like proteins revealed that the GSH-binding motifs (CXXC/CXXS, TVP, CDD, Lys26 and Gln/Arg63) are structurally conserved. Both the monothiol and dithiol Grxs possess three conserved water molecules; two of these were located in the GSH-binding site. PfGrx1 has several polar and charged amino-acid substitutions that provide structurally important additional hydrogen bonds and salt bridges missing in other Grxs.</p>

<p>Radiation damage is an inherent problem in protein X-ray crystallography and the process has recently been shown to be highly specific, exhibiting features such as cleavage of disulfide bonds, decarboxylation of acidic residues, increase in atomic B factors and increase in unit-cell volume. Reported here are two trypsin structures at atomic resolution (1.00 and 0.95 A), the data for which were collected at a third-generation synchrotron (ESRF) at two different beamlines. Both trypsin structures exhibit broken disulfide bonds; in particular, the bond from Cys191 to Cys220 is very sensitive to synchrotron radiation. The data set collected at the most intense beamline (ID14-EH4) shows increased structural radiation damage in terms of lower occupancies for cysteine residues, more breakage in the six disulfide bonds and more alternate conformations. It appears that high intensity and not only the total X-ray dose is most harmful to protein crystals.</p>

<p>The sesquiterpene bisabolene was recently identified as a biosynthetic precursor to bisabolane, an advanced biofuel with physicochemical properties similar to those of D2 diesel. High-titer microbial bisabolene production was achieved using Abies grandis α-bisabolene synthase (AgBIS). Here, we report the structure of AgBIS, a three-domain plant sesquiterpene synthase, crystallized in its apo form and bound to five different inhibitors. Structural and biochemical characterization of the AgBIS terpene synthase Class I active site leads us to propose a catalytic mechanism for the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate into bisabolene via a bisabolyl cation intermediate. Further, we describe the nonfunctional AgBIS Class II active site whose high similarity to bifunctional diterpene synthases makes it an important link in understanding terpene synthase evolution. Practically, the AgBIS crystal structure is important in future protein engineering efforts to increase the microbial production of bisabolene.</p>

<p>Using fixed receptor sites derived from high-resolution crystal structures in structure-based drug design does not properly account for ligand-induced enzyme conformational change and imparts a bias into the discovery and design of novel ligands. We sought to facilitate the design of improved drug leads by defining residues most likely to change conformation, and then defining a minimal manifold of possible conformations of a target site for drug design based on a small number of identified flexible residues.</p>

<p>Accumulation of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in bacteria disrupts the S-adenosylmethionine pool to alter biological methylations, synthesis of polyamines, and production of quorum-sensing molecules. Bacterial metabolism of MTA and SAH depends on MTA/SAH nucleosidase (MTAN), an enzyme not present in humans and a target for quorum sensing because MTAN activity is essential for synthesis of autoinducer-2 molecules. Crystals of Salmonella enterica MTAN with product and transition state analogs of MTA and SAH explain the structural contacts causing pM binding affinity for the inhibitor and reveal a "water-wire" channel for the catalytic nucleophile. The crystal structure shows an extension of the binding pocket filled with polyethylene glycol. We exploited this discovery by the design and synthesis of tailored modifications of the currently existing transition state analogs to fill this site. This site was not anticipated in MTAN structures. Tailored inhibitors with dissociation constants of 5 to 15 pM are characterized.</p>

<p>The explosion of protein sequence information requires that current strategies for function assignment evolve to complement experimental approaches with computationally based function prediction. This necessitates the development of strategies based on the identification of sequence markers in the form of specificity determinants and a more informed definition of orthologues. Herein, we have undertaken the function assignment of the unknown haloalkanoate dehalogenase superfamily member BT2127 (Uniprot accession code Q8A5 V9) from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron using an integrated bioinformatics-structure-mechanism approach. The substrate specificity profile and steady-state rate constants of BT2127 (with a k(cat)/K(m) value for pyrophosphate of ~1 × 10(5) M(-1) s(-1)), together with the gene context, support the assigned in vivo function as an inorganic pyrophosphatase. The X-ray structural analysis of wild-type BT2127 and several variants generated by site-directed mutagenesis shows that substrate discrimination is based, in part, on active site space restrictions imposed by the cap domain (specifically by residues Tyr76 and Glu47). Structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis coupled with kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes identified the residues required for catalysis, substrate binding, and domain-domain association. On the basis of this structure-function analysis, the catalytic residues Asp11, Asp13, Thr113, and Lys147 as well the metal binding residues Asp171, Asn172, and Glu47 were used as markers to confirm BT2127 orthologues identified via sequence searches. This bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that the biological range of BT2127 orthologue is restricted to the phylum Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. The key structural determinants in the divergence of BT2127 and its closest homologue, β-phosphoglucomutase, control the leaving group size (phosphate vs glucose phosphate) and the position of the Asp acid/base in the open versus closed conformations. HADSF pyrophosphatases represent a third mechanistic and fold type for bacterial pyrophosphatases.</p>

<p>Rhomboid proteases are evolutionary conserved intramembrane serine proteases. Because of their emerging role in many important biological pathways, rhomboids are potential drug targets. Unfortunately, few chemical tools are available for their study. Here, we describe a mass spectrometry-based assay to measure rhomboid substrate cleavage and inhibition. We have identified isocoumarin inhibitors and developed activity-based probes for rhomboid proteases. The probes can distinguish between active and inactive rhomboids due to covalent, reversible binding of the active-site serine and stable modification of a histidine residue. Finally, the structure of an isocoumarin-based inhibitor with Escherichia coli rhomboid GlpG uncovers an unusual mode of binding at the active site and suggests that the interactions between the 3-substituent on the isocoumarin inhibitor and hydrophobic residues on the protease reflect S' subsite binding. Overall, these probes represent valuable tools for rhomboid study, and the structural insights may facilitate future inhibitor design.</p>

<p>The functionally versatile (β/α)(8) barrel scaffold was used to migrate triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) to thiamin phosphate synthase (TPS) activity, two enzymes that share the same fold but catalyze unrelated reactions through different mechanisms. The high sensitivity of the selection methodology was determinant to succeed in finding proteins with the desired activity. A combination of rational design and random mutagenesis was used to achieve the desired catalytic migration. One of the parallel directed evolution strategies followed resulted in TPI derivatives able to complement the thiamin phosphate auxotrophy phenotype of an Escherichia coli strain deleted of thiE, the gene that codes for TPS. Successive rounds of directed evolution resulted in better complementing TPI variants. Biochemical characterization of some of the evolved TPI clones demonstrated that the K(m) for the TPS substrates was similar to that of the native TPS; however and in agreement with the very slow complementation phenotype, the k(cat) was 4 orders of magnitude lower, indicating that substrate binding played a major role on selection. Interestingly, the crystal structure of the most proficient variant showed a slightly modified TPI active site occupied by a thiamin-phosphate-like molecule. Substitution of key residues in this region reduced TPS activity, strongly suggesting that this is also the catalytic site for the evolved TPS activity. The presence of the TPS reaction product at the active site explains the fast inactivation of the enzyme observed. In conclusion, by combining rational design, random mutagenesis and a very sensitive selection, it is possible to achieve enzymatic activity migration.</p>

<p>The yeast peroxisomal hydrolase Lpx1 belongs to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily. In the absence of Lpx1, yeast peroxisomes show an aberrant vacuolated morphology similar to what is found in peroxisomal disorder patients. Here, we present the crystal structure of Lpx1 determined at a resolution of 1.9 Å. The structure reveals the complete catalytic triad with an unusual location of the acid residue after strand β6 of the canonical α/β-hydrolase fold. A four-helix cap domain covers the active site. The interface between the α/β-hydrolase core and the cap domain forms the potential substrate binding site, which may also comprise the tunnel that leads into the protein interior and widens into a cavity. Two further tunnels connect the active site to the protein surface, potentially facilitating substrate access. Lpx1 is a homodimer. The α/β-hydrolase core folds of the two protomers form the dimer contact site. Further dimerization contacts arise from the mutual embracement of the cap domain of one protomer by the non-canonical C-terminal helix of the other, resulting in a total buried surface area of some 6000 Å². The unusual C-terminal helix sticks out from the core fold to which it is connected by an extended flexible loop. We analyzed whether this helix is required for dimerization and for import of the dimer into peroxisomes using biochemical assays in vitro and a microscopy-based interaction assay in mammalian cells. Surprisingly, the C-terminal helix is dispensable for dimerization and dimer import. The unusually robust self-interaction suggests that Lpx1 is imported into peroxisomes as dimer.</p>

<p>The key residue of the active site of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is the catalytic glutamate, which is proposed to be important (i) as a catalytic base, for initiating the reaction, as well as (ii) for the subsequent proton shuttling steps. The structural properties of this glutamate in the liganded complex have been investigated by studying the high resolution crystal structures of typanosomal TIM, complexed with three suicide inhibitors: (S)-glycidol phosphate ((S)-GOP, at 0.99 Å resolution), (R)-glycidol phosphate, ((R)-GOP, at 1.08 Å resolution), and bromohydroxyacetone phosphate (BHAP, at 1.97 Å resolution). The structures show that in the (S)-GOP active site this catalytic glutamate is in the well characterized, competent conformation. However, an unusual side chain conformation is observed in the (R)-GOP and BHAP complexes. In addition, Glu97, salt bridged to the catalytic lysine in the competent active site, adopts an unusual side chain conformation in these two latter complexes. The higher chemical reactivity of (S)-GOP compared with (R)-GOP, as known from solution studies, can be understood: the structures indicate that in the case of (S)-GOP, Glu167 can attack the terminal carbon of the epoxide in a stereoelectronically favored, nearly linear OCO arrangement, but this is not possible for the (R)-GOP isomer. These structures confirm the previously proposed conformational flexibility of the catalytic glutamate in its closed, liganded state. The importance of this conformational flexibility for the proton shuttling steps in the TIM catalytic cycle, which is apparently achieved by a sliding motion of the side chain carboxylate group above the enediolate plane, is also discussed.</p>

<p>A series of derivatives of 2-anilino-5-phenyloxazole (5) has been identified as inhibitors of VEGFR2 kinase. Herein we describe the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this novel template. Optimization of both aryl rings led to very potent inhibitors at both the enzymatic and cellular levels. Oxazole 39 had excellent solubility and good oral PK when dosed as the bis-mesylate salt and demonstrated moderate in vivo efficacy against HT29 human colon tumor xenografts. X-ray crystallography confirmed the proposed binding mode, and comparison of oxazoles 39 and 46 revealed interesting differences in orientation of 2-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl rings, respectively, attached at the meta position of the 5-phenyl ring.</p>

<p>Detection, immobilization and purification of carbohydrates can be done using molecular probes that specifically bind to targeted carbohydrate epitopes. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are discrete parts of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes that can be engineered to bind and detect specifically a number of carbohydrates. Design and engineering of CBMs have benefited greatly from structural studies that have helped us to decipher the basis for specificity in carbohydrate-protein interactions. However, more studies are needed to predict which modifications in a CBM would generate probes with predetermined binding properties. In this report, we present the crystal structures of two highly related engineered CBMs with different binding specificity profiles: X-2, which is specific for xylans and the L110F mutant of X-2, which binds xyloglucans and β-glucans in addition to xylans. The structures of the modules were solved both in the apo form and complexed with oligomers of xylose, as well as with an oligomer of glucose in the case of X-2 L110F. The mutation, leucine to phenylalanine, converting the specific module into a cross-reactive one, introduces a crucial hydrogen-π interaction that allows the mutant to retain glucan-based ligands. The cross-reactivity of X-2 L110F is furthermore made possible by the plasticity of the protein, in particular, of residue R142, which permits accommodation of an extra hydroxymethyl group present in cellopentaose and not xylopentaose. Altogether, this study shows, in structural detail, altered protein-carbohydrate interactions that have high impact on the binding properties of a carbohydrate probe but are introduced through simple mutagenesis.</p>

<p>The Escherichia coli T4 bacteriophage uses two glycosyltransferases to glucosylate and thus protect its DNA: the retaining alpha-glucosyltransferase (AGT) and the inverting beta-glucosyltransferase (BGT). They glucosylate 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-HMC) bases of duplex DNA using UDP-glucose as the sugar donor to form an alpha-glucosidic linkage and a beta-glucosidic linkage, respectively. Five structures of AGT have been determined: a binary complex with the UDP product and four ternary complexes with UDP or UDP-glucose and oligonucleotides containing an A:G, HMU:G (hydroxymethyl uracyl) or AP:G (apurinic/apyrimidinic) mismatch at the target base-pair. AGT adopts the GT-B fold, one of the two folds known for GTs. However, while the sugar donor binding mode is classical for a GT-B enzyme, the sugar acceptor binding mode is unexpected and breaks the established consensus: AGT is the first GT-B enzyme that predominantly binds both the sugar donor and acceptor to the C-terminal domain. Its active site pocket is highly similar to four retaining GT-B glycosyltransferases (trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, glycogen synthase, glycogen and maltodextrin phosphorylases) strongly suggesting a common evolutionary origin and catalytic mechanism for these enzymes. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analysis do not permit identification of a nucleophile residue responsible for a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate for the classical double displacement mechanism. Interestingly, the DNA structures reveal partially flipped-out bases. They provide evidence for a passive role of AGT in the base-flipping mechanism and for its specific recognition of the acceptor base.</p>

<p>DNA cytosine methylation is a widespread epigenetic mark. Biological effects of DNA methylation are mediated by the proteins that preferentially bind to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in different sequence contexts. Until now two different structural mechanisms have been established for 5mC recognition in eukaryotes; however, it is still unknown how discrimination of the 5mC modification is achieved in prokaryotes. Here we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (McrB-N) of the methyl-specific endonuclease McrBC from Escherichia coli. The McrB-N protein shows a novel DNA-binding fold adapted for 5mC-recognition. In the McrB-N structure in complex with methylated DNA, the 5mC base is flipped out from the DNA duplex and positioned within a binding pocket. Base flipping elegantly explains why McrBC system restricts only T4-even phages impaired in glycosylation [Luria, S.E. and Human, M.L. (1952) A nonhereditary, host-induced variation of bacterial viruses. J. Bacteriol., 64, 557-569]: flipped out 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is accommodated in the binding pocket but there is no room for the glycosylated base. The mechanism for 5mC recognition employed by McrB-N is highly reminiscent of that for eukaryotic SRA domains, despite the differences in their protein folds.</p>

<p>D-Serine dehydratase from Escherichia coli is a member of the β-family (fold-type II) of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes, catalyzing the conversion of D-serine to pyruvate and ammonia. The crystal structure of monomeric D-serine dehydratase has been solved to 1.97Å-resolution for an orthorhombic data set by molecular replacement. In addition, the structure was refined in a monoclinic data set to 1.55Å resolution. The structure of DSD reveals a larger pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-binding domain and a smaller domain. The active site of DSD is very similar to those of the other members of the β-family. Lys118 forms the Schiff base to PLP, the cofactor phosphate group is liganded to a tetraglycine cluster Gly279-Gly283, and the 3-hydroxyl group of PLP is liganded to Asn170 and N1 to Thr424, respectively. In the closed conformation the movement of the small domain blocks the entrance to active site of DSD. The domain movement plays an important role in the formation of the substrate recognition site and the catalysis of the enzyme. Modeling of D-serine into the active site of DSD suggests that the hydroxyl group of D-serine is coordinated to the carboxyl group of Asp238. The carboxyl oxygen of D-serine is coordinated to the hydroxyl group of Ser167 and the amide group of Leu171 (O1), whereas the O2 of the carboxyl group of D-serine is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Ser167 and the amide group of Thr168. A catalytic mechanism very similar to that proposed for L-serine dehydratase is discussed.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the extracellular bacterial serine protease alpha-lytic protease (alphaLP) has been solved at 0.83 A resolution at pH 8. This ultra-high resolution structure allows accurate analysis of structural elements not possible with previous structures. Hydrogen atoms are visible, and confirm active-site hydrogen-bonding interactions expected for the apo enzyme. In particular, His57 N(delta1) participates in a normal hydrogen bond with Asp102 in the catalytic triad, with a hydrogen atom visible 0.83(+/-0.06)A from the His N(delta1). The catalytic Ser195 occupies two conformations, one corresponding to a population of His57 that is doubly protonated, the other to the singly protonated His57. Based on the occupancy of these conformations, the pKa of His57 is calculated to be approximately 8.8 when a sulfate ion occupies the active site. This 0.83 A structure has allowed critical analysis of geometric distortions within the structure. Interestingly, Phe228 is significantly distorted from planarity. The distortion of Phe228, buried in the core of the C-terminal domain, occurs at an estimated energetic cost of 4.1 kcal/mol. The conformational space for Phe228 is severely limited by the presence of Trp199, which prevents Phe228 from adopting the rotamer observed in many other chymotrypsin family members. In alphaLP, the only allowed rotamer leads to the deformation of Phe228 due to steric interactions with Thr181. We hypothesize that tight packing of co-evolved residues in this region, and the subsequent deformation of Phe228, contributes to the high cooperativity and large energetic barriers for folding and unfolding of alphaLP. The kinetic stability imparted by the large, cooperative unfolding barrier plays a critical role in extending the lifetime of the protease in its harsh environment.</p>

<p>Involved or implicated in a wide spectrum of diseases, trypsin-like serine proteases comprise well studied drug targets and anti-targets that can be subdivided into two major classes. In one class there is a serine at position 190 at the S1 site, as in urokinase type plasminogen activator (urokinase or uPA) and factor VIIa, and in the other there is an alanine at 190, as in tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) and factor Xa. A hydrogen bond unique to Ser190 protease-arylamidine complexes between O gamma(Ser190) and the inhibitor amidine confers an intrinsic preference for such inhibitors toward Ser190 proteases over Ala190 counterparts.</p>

<p>Peptides that inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase 2 by blocking the macromolecular substrate recruitment site of cyclin A were simplified, for example, by replacement of dipeptide units with beta-amino acids. The smallest inhibitor retaining activity was a tripeptide, whose binding mode was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. This result suggests that nonpeptidic cyclin groove inhibitors may be feasible therapeutic agents.The cyclin-dependent kinase 2-cyclin A complex is an important regulator of the DNA-synthesis phase of the mammalian cell cycle, which is frequently deregulated in cancer. Rather than blocking the ATP-binding site of the apparently redundant kinase subunit, targeting the binding site for macromolecular substrates and regulatory proteins of cyclin A represents a promising strategy to enforce tumour-selective apoptosis. The cyclin-binding groove can be blocked with comparatively small synthetic peptides, which indirectly leads to inhibition of kinase function, but these peptides are metabolically labile and membrane impermeable. As part of our ongoing effort to develop more druglike peptidomimetics derived from cyclin-groove-binding peptides, we report the results of our studies aimed at a detailed understanding of the structural determinants required for effective binding. Using a combination of peptide synthesis, biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography, we show that it is possible to simplify peptide structures through the replacement of dipeptide units in which one of the residues is not directly involved in binding, through the introduction of beta-amino acid residues that retain only the dipeptide residue side chain that is important for binding. This approach also allowed us to probe spatial constraints in general, as well as the importance of peptide backbone hydrogen-bonding functions. Our identification of potent beta-homoleucine-containing tetrapeptide inhibitors, as well as the finding that an optimised N-terminally acetylated tripeptide retains some cyclin A-binding affinity, suggest that the pharmacological targeting of the cyclin A binding groove may be feasible.</p>

<p>Organophosphate compounds (OP) are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) and can cause lethal poisoning in humans. Inhibition of AChEs by the OP soman involves phosphonylation of the catalytic serine, and subsequent dealkylation produces a form known as the "aged" enzyme. The nonaged form can be reactivated to a certain extent by nucleophiles, such as pralidoxime (2-PAM), whereas aged forms of OP-inhibited AChEs are totally resistant to reactivation. Here, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of AChE from Torpedo californica (TcAChE) conjugated with soman before and after aging. The absolute configuration of the soman stereoisomer adduct in the nonaged conjugate is P(S)C(R). A structural reorientation of the catalytic His440 side chain was observed during the aging process. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the ternary complex of the aged conjugate with 2-PAM revealed that the orientation of the oxime function does not permit nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom, thus providing a plausible explanation for its failure to reactivate the aged soman/AChE conjugate. Together, these three crystal structures provide an experimental basis for the design of new reactivators.</p>

<p>Experimental observations of fluoromagnesate and fluoroaluminate complexes of β-phosphoglucomutase (β-PGM) have demonstrated the importance of charge balance in transition-state stabilization for phosphoryl transfer enzymes. Here, direct observations of ground-state analog complexes of β-PGM involving trifluoroberyllate establish that when the geometry and charge distribution closely match those of the substrate, the distribution of conformers in solution and in the crystal predominantly places the reacting centers in van der Waals proximity. Importantly, two variants are found, both of which satisfy the criteria for near attack conformers. In one variant, the aspartate general base for the reaction is remote from the nucleophile. The nucleophile remains protonated and forms a nonproductive hydrogen bond to the phosphate surrogate. In the other variant, the general base forms a hydrogen bond to the nucleophile that is now correctly orientated for the chemical transfer step. By contrast, in the absence of substrate, the solvent surrounding the phosphate surrogate is arranged to disfavor nucleophilic attack by water. Taken together, the trifluoroberyllate complexes of β-PGM provide a picture of how the enzyme is able to organize itself for the chemical step in catalysis through the population of intermediates that respond to increasing proximity of the nucleophile. These experimental observations show how the enzyme is capable of stabilizing the reaction pathway toward the transition state and also of minimizing unproductive catalysis of aspartyl phosphate hydrolysis.</p>

<p>An understanding of the physiological and toxicological properties of borate and the utilization of boronic acids in drug development require a basic understanding of borate-enzyme chemistry. We report here the extension of our recent NMR studies indicating the formation of a ternary borate-alcohol-trypsin complex. Crystallographic and solution state NMR studies of porcine trypsin were performed in the presence of borate and either of three alcohols designed to bind to the S1 affinity subsite: 4-aminobutanol, guanidine-3-propanol, and 4-hydroxymethylbenzamidine. Quaternary complexes of trypsin, borate, S1-binding alcohol, and ethylene glycol (a cryoprotectant), as well as a ternary trypsin, borate, and ethylene glycol complex have been observed in the crystalline state. Borate forms ester bonds to Ser195, ethylene glycol (two bonds), and the S1-binding alcohol (if present). Spectra from (1)H and (11)B NMR studies confirm that these complexes also exist in solution and also provide evidence for the formation of ternary trypsin, borate, and S1-subsite alcohol complexes which are not observed in the crystals using our experimental protocols. Analysis of eight crystal structures indicates that formation of an active site borate complex is in all cases accompanied by a significant (approximately 4%) increase in the b-axis dimension of the unit cell. Presumably, our inability to observe the ternary complexes in the crystalline state arises from the lower stability of these complexes and consequent inability to overcome the constraints imposed by the lattice contacts. A mechanism for the coupling of the lattice contacts with the active site that involves a conformational rearrangement of Gln192 is suggested. The structures presented here represent the first crystallographic demonstration of covalent binding of an enzyme by borate.</p>

<p>Brassinosteroid signaling kinases (BSKs) are plant-specific receptor-like cytoplasmic protein kinases involved in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway. Unlike common protein kinases, they possess a naturally occurring alanine residue at the "gatekeeper" position, as well as other sequence variations. How BSKs activate downstream proteins such as BSU1, as well as the structural consequences of their unusual sequential features, was unclear. We crystallized the catalytic domain of BSK8 and solved its structure by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing methods to a resolution of 1.5Å. In addition, a co-crystal structure of BSK8 with 5-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) revealed unusual conformational arrangements of the nucleotide phosphate groups and catalytic key motifs, typically not observed for active protein kinases. Sequential analysis and comparisons with known pseudokinase structures suggest that BSKs represent constitutively inactive protein kinases that regulate brassinosteroid signal transfer through an allosteric mechanism. </p>

<p>Peripheral membrane proteins can be targeted to specific organelles or the plasma membrane by differential recognition of phospholipid headgroups. Although molecular determinants of specificity for several headgroups, including phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositides are well defined, specific recognition of the headgroup of the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) is less well understood. In cytosolic proteins the cation-π box provides a suitable receptor for choline recognition and binding through the trimethylammonium moiety. In PC, this moiety might provide a sufficient handle to bind to peripheral proteins via a cation-π cage, where the π systems of two or more aromatic residues are within 4-5 Å of the quaternary amine. We prove this hypothesis by engineering the cation-π box into secreted phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus, which lacks specific PC recognition. The N254Y/H258Y variant selectively binds PC-enriched vesicles, and x-ray crystallography reveals N254Y/H258Y binds choline and dibutyroylphosphatidylcholine within the cation-π motif. Such simple PC recognition motifs could be engineered into a wide variety of secondary structures providing a generally applicable method for specific recognition of PC.</p>

<p>To identify specific bacterial thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors, we exploited phenolphthalein (PTH), which inhibits both bacterial and human enzymes. The X-ray crystal structure of Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS) that binds PTH showed multiple binding modes of the inhibitor, which prevented a classical structure-based drug design approach. To overcome this issue, we synthesized two phthalimidic libraries that were tested against TS enzymes and then we performed X-ray crystallographic screening of the active compounds. Compounds 6A, 8A, and 12A showed 40-fold higher affinity for bacterial TS than human TS. The X-ray crystallographic screening characterized the binding mode of six inhibitors in complexes with LcTS. Of these, 20A, 23A, and 24A showed a common unique binding mode, whereas 8A showed a different, unique binding mode. A comparative analysis of the LcTS X-ray complexes that were obtained with the pathogenic TS enabled the selection of compounds 8A and 23A as specific compounds and starting points to be exploited for the specific inhibition of pathogen enzymes.</p>

<p>The enzymatic degradation of azo dyes begins with the reduction of the azo bond. In this article, we report the crystal structures of the native azoreductase from Pseudomonas putida MET94 (PpAzoR) (1.60 Å), of PpAzoR in complex with anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (1.50 Å), and of PpAzoR in complex with Reactive Black 5 dye (1.90 Å). These structures reveal the residues and subtle changes that accompany substrate binding and release. Such changes highlight the fine control of access to the catalytic site that is required by the ping-pong mechanism, and in turn the specificity offered by the enzyme towards different substrates. The topology surrounding the active site shows novel features of substrate recognition and binding that help to explain and differentiate the substrate specificity observed among different bacterial azoreductases. </p>

<p>Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is a catalytically proficient member of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily secreted along with other eosinophil granule proteins during innate host defense responses and various eosinophil-related inflammatory and allergic diseases. The ribonucleolytic activity of EDN is central to its antiviral and neurotoxic activities and possibly to other facets of its biological activity. To probe the importance of this enzymatic activity further, specific inhibitors will be of great aid. Derivatives of 5'-ADP are among the most potent inhibitors currently known. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to investigate the binding of four natural nucleotides containing this moiety. 5'-ATP binds in two alternative orientations, one occupying the B2 subsite in a conventional manner and one being a retro orientation with no ordered adenosine moiety. Diadenosine triphosphate (Ap3A) and diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) bind with one adenine positioned at the B2 subsite, the polyphosphate chain extending across the P1 subsite in an ill-defined conformation, and a disordered second adenosine moiety. Diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A), the most avid inhibitor of this series, binds in a completely ordered fashion with one adenine positioned conventionally at the B2 subsite, the polyphosphate chain occupying the P1 and putative P(-1) subsites, and the other adenine bound in a retro-like manner at the edge of the B1 subsite. The binding mode of each of these inhibitors has features seen in previously determined structures of adenosine diphosphates. We examine the structure-affinity relationships of these inhibitors and discuss the implications for the design of improved inhibitors.</p>

<p>Cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKOs) mediate catabolic regulation of cytokinin levels in plants. Several substrate analogs containing an unsaturated side chain were studied for their possible inhibitory effect on maize CKO (ZmCKO1) by use of various bioanalytical methods. Two allenic derivatives, N(6)-(buta-2,3-dienyl)adenine (HA-8) and N(6)-(penta-2,3-dienyl)adenine (HA-1), were identified as strong mechanism-based inhibitors of the enzyme. Despite exhaustive dialysis, the enzyme remained inhibited. Conversely, substrate analogs with a triple bond in the side chain were much weaker inactivators. The crystal structures of recombinant ZmCKO1 complexed with HA-1 or HA-8 were solved to 1.95 A resolution. Together with Raman spectra of the inactivated enzyme, it was revealed that reactive imine intermediates generated by oxidation of the allenic inhibitors covalently bind to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. The binding occurs at the C4a atom of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, the planarity of which is consequently disrupted. All the compounds under study were also analyzed for binding to the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors AHK3 and AHK4 in a bacterial receptor assay and for cytokinin activity in the Amaranthus bioassay. HA-1 and HA-8 were found to be good receptor ligands with a significant cytokinin activity. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inactivate CKO in the desired time intervals or developmental stages, they both represent attractive compounds for physiological studies, as the inhibition mechanism of HA-1 and HA-8 is mainly FAD dependent.</p>

<p>Glycosylasparaginase (GA) plays an important role in asparagine-linked glycoprotein degradation. A deficiency in the activity of human GA leads to a lysosomal storage disease named aspartylglycosaminuria. GA belongs to a superfamily of N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases that autoproteolytically generate their mature enzymes from inactive single chain protein precursors. The side-chain of the newly exposed N-terminal residue then acts as a nucleophile during substrate hydrolysis. By taking advantage of mutant enzyme of Flavobacterium meningosepticum GA with reduced enzymatic activity, we have obtained a crystallographic snapshot of a productive complex with its substrate (NAcGlc-Asn), at 2.0 A resolution. This complex structure provided us an excellent model for the Michaelis complex to examine the specific contacts critical for substrate binding and catalysis. Substrate binding induces a conformational change near the active site of GA. To initiate catalysis, the side-chain of the N-terminal Thr152 is polarized by the free alpha-amino group on the same residue, mediated by the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr170. Cleavage of the amide bond is then accomplished by a nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon of the amide linkage in the substrate, leading to the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate through a negatively charged tetrahedral transition state.</p>

<p>The OB-fold is a small, versatile single-domain protein binding module that occurs in all forms of life, where it binds protein, carbohydrate, nucleic acid and small-molecule ligands. We have exploited this natural plasticity to engineer a new class of non-immunoglobulin alternatives to antibodies with unique structural and biophysical characteristics. We present here the engineering of the OB-fold anticodon recognition domain from aspartyl tRNA synthetase taken from the thermophile Pyrobaculum aerophilum. For this single-domain scaffold we have coined the term OBody. Starting from a naïve combinatorial library, we engineered an OBody with 3 nM affinity for hen egg-white lysozyme, by optimising the affinity of a naïve OBody 11,700-fold over several affinity maturation steps, using phage display. At each maturation step a crystal structure of the engineered OBody in complex with hen egg-white lysozyme was determined, showing binding elements in atomic detail. These structures have given us an unprecedented insight into the directed evolution of affinity for a single antigen on the molecular scale. The engineered OBodies retain the high thermal stability of the parental OB-fold despite mutation of up to 22% of their residues. They can be expressed in soluble form and also purified from bacteria at high yields. They also lack disulfide bonds. These data demonstrate the potential of OBodies as a new scaffold for the engineering of specific binding reagents and provide a platform for further development of future OBody-based applications. </p>

<p>The structural and kinetic effects of amprenavir (APV), a clinical HIV protease (PR) inhibitor, were analyzed with wild-type enzyme and mutants with single substitutions of V32I, I50V, I54V, I54M, I84V and L90M that are common in drug resistance. Crystal structures of the APV complexes at resolutions of 1.02-1.85 Å reveal the structural changes due to the mutations. Substitution of the larger side chains in PR(V32I) , PR(I54M) and PR(L90M) resulted in the formation of new hydrophobic contacts with flap residues, residues 79 and 80, and Asp25, respectively. Mutation to smaller side chains eliminated hydrophobic interactions in the PR(I50V) and PR(I54V) structures. The PR(I84V)-APV complex had lost hydrophobic contacts with APV, the PR(V32I)-APV complex showed increased hydrophobic contacts within the hydrophobic cluster and the PR(I50V) complex had weaker polar and hydrophobic interactions with APV. The observed structural changes in PR(I84V)-APV, PR(V32I)-APV and PR(I50V)-APV were related to their reduced inhibition by APV of six-, 10- and 30-fold, respectively, relative to wild-type PR. The APV complexes were compared with the corresponding saquinavir complexes. The PR dimers had distinct rearrangements of the flaps and 80's loops that adapt to the different P1' groups of the inhibitors, while maintaining contacts within the hydrophobic cluster. These small changes in the loops and weak internal interactions produce the different patterns of resistant mutations for the two drugs.</p>

<p>The final step in the enzymatic synthesis of the ABO(H) blood group A and B antigens is catalyzed by two closely related glycosyltransferases, an alpha-(1--&gt;3)-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GTA) and an alpha-(1--&gt;3)-galactosyltransferase (GTB). Of their 354 amino acid residues, GTA and GTB differ by only four "critical" residues. High resolution structures for GTB and the GTA/GTB chimeric enzymes GTB/G176R and GTB/G176R/G235S bound to a panel of donor and acceptor analog substrates reveal "open," "semi-closed," and "closed" conformations as the enzymes go from the unliganded to the liganded states. In the open form the internal polypeptide loop (amino acid residues 177-195) adjacent to the active site in the unliganded or H antigen-bound enzymes is composed of two alpha-helices spanning Arg(180)-Met(186) and Arg(188)-Asp(194), respectively. The semi-closed and closed forms of the enzymes are generated by binding of UDP or of UDP and H antigen analogs, respectively, and show that these helices merge to form a single distorted helical structure with alternating alpha-3(10)-alpha character that partially occludes the active site. The closed form is distinguished from the semi-closed form by the ordering of the final nine C-terminal residues through the formation of hydrogen bonds to both UDP and H antigen analogs. The semi-closed forms for various mutants generally show significantly more disorder than the open forms, whereas the closed forms display little or no disorder depending strongly on the identity of residue 176. Finally, the use of synthetic analogs reveals how H antigen acceptor binding can be critical in stabilizing the closed conformation. These structures demonstrate a delicately balanced substrate recognition mechanism and give insight on critical aspects of donor and acceptor specificity, on the order of substrate binding, and on the requirements for catalysis.</p>

<p>Class I alpha-mannosidases (glycoside hydrolase family GH47) play key roles in the maturation of N-glycans and the ER-associated degradation of unfolded glycoproteins. The 1.95 A resolution structure of a fungal alpha-1,2-mannosidase in complex with the substrate analogue methyl-alpha-D-lyxopyranosyl-(1',2)-alpha-D-mannopyranoside (LM) shows the intact disaccharide spanning the -1/+1 subsites, with the D-lyxoside ring in the -1 subsite in the 1C4 chair conformation, and provides insight into the mechanism of catalysis. The absence of the C5' hydroxymethyl group on the D-lyxoside moiety results in the side chain of Arg407 adopting two alternative conformations: the minor one interacting with Asp375 and the major one interacting with both the D-lyxoside and the catalytic base Glu409, thus disrupting its function. Chemical modification of Asp375 has previously been shown to inactivate the enzyme. Taken together, the data suggest that Arg407, which belongs to the conserved sequence motif RPExxE, may act to modulate the activity of the enzyme. The proposed mechanism for modulating the activity is potentially a general mechanism for this superfamily.</p>

<p>The single-crystal X-ray structure of phosphoglycerate mutase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been determined at a resolution of 1.70 angstroms. The C-terminal tail of each of the subunits is flexible and disordered; however, for one of the four chains (chain A) all but five residues of the chain could be modeled. Noteworthy features of the structure include the active site and a proline-rich segment in each monomer forming a short left-handed polyprolyl helix. These segments lie on the enzyme surface and could conceivably participate in protein-protein interactions.</p>

<p>The X-ray structure of the holo-form of l-threonine dehydrogenase (TDH) from Thermococcus kodakaraensis (TkTDH) has been determined at 2.4A resolution. TDH catalyses the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of l-threonine to 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate, and is one of the first enzymes in this family to be solved by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme is a homo-tetramer, each monomer consisting of 350 amino acids that form two domains; a catalytic domain and a nicotinamide co-factor (NAD(+))-binding domain, which contains an alpha/beta Rossmann fold motif. An extended twelve-stranded beta-sheet is formed by the association of pairs of monomers in the tetramer. TkTDH shows strong overall structural similarity to TDHs from thermophiles and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) from lower life forms, despite low sequence homology, exhibiting the same overall fold of the monomer and assembly of the tetramer. The structure reveals the binding site of the essential co-factor NAD(+) which is present in all subunits. Docking studies suggest a mode of interaction of TDH with 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase, the subsequent enzyme in the pathway for conversion of threonine to glycine. TDH is known to form a stable functional complex with 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate ligase, most probably to shield an unstable intermediate.</p>

<p>Type IIA topoisomerases control DNA supercoiling and disentangle chromosomes through a complex ATP-dependent strand-passage mechanism. Although a general framework exists for type IIA topoisomerase function, the architecture of the full-length enzyme has remained undefined. Here we present the structure of a fully catalytic Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II homodimer complexed with DNA and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. The enzyme adopts a domain-swapped configuration wherein the ATPase domain of one protomer sits atop the nucleolytic region of its partner subunit. This organization produces an unexpected interaction between bound DNA and a conformational transducing element in the ATPase domain, which we show is critical for both DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and global topoisomerase activity. Our data indicate that the ATPase domains pivot about each other to ensure unidirectional strand passage and that this state senses bound DNA to promote ATP turnover and enzyme reset.</p>

<p>Although most DNA polymerases discriminate against ribonucleotide triphosphaets (rNTPs) during DNA synthesis, recent studies have shown that large numbers of ribonucleotides are incorporated into the eukaryotic nuclear genome. Here, we investigate how a DNA polymerase can stably incorporate an rNTP. The X-ray crystal structure of a variant of human DNA polymerase λ reveals that the rNTP occupies the nucleotide binding pocket without distortion of the active site, despite an unfavorable interaction between the 2'-O and Tyr505 backbone carbonyl. This indicates an energetically unstable binding state for the rNTP, stabilized by additional protein-nucleotide interactions. Supporting this idea is the 200-fold lower catalytic efficiency for rNTP relative to deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) incorporation, reflecting a higher apparent Km value for the rNTP. Furthermore, distortion observed in the structure of the post-catalytic product complex suggests that once the bond between the α- and β-phosphates of the rNTP is broken, the unfavorable binding state of the ribonucleotide cannot be maintained. Finally, structural and biochemical evaluation of dNTP insertion onto an ribonucleotide monophosphate (rNMP)-terminated primer indicates that a primer-terminal rNMP does not impede extension. The results are relevant to how ribonucleotides are incorporated into DNA in vivo, during replication and during repair, perhaps especially in non-proliferating cells when rNTP:dNTP ratios are high.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the membrane-bound O(2)-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase 1 from Escherichia coli (EcHyd-1) has been solved in three different states: as-isolated, H(2)-reduced, and chemically oxidized. As very recently reported for similar enzymes from Ralstonia eutropha and Hydrogenovibrio marinus, two supernumerary Cys residues coordinate the proximal [FeS] cluster in EcHyd-1, which lacks one of the inorganic sulfide ligands. We find that the as-isolated, aerobically purified species contains a mixture of at least two conformations for one of the cluster iron ions and Glu76. In one of them, Glu76 and the iron occupy positions that are similar to those found in O(2)-sensitive [NiFe]-hydrogenases. In the other conformation, this iron binds, besides three sulfur ligands, the amide N from Cys20 and one Oε of Glu76. Our calculations show that oxidation of this unique iron generates the high-potential form of the proximal cluster. The structural rearrangement caused by oxidation is confirmed by our H(2)-reduced and oxidized EcHyd-1 structures. Thus, thanks to the peculiar coordination of the unique iron, the proximal cluster can contribute two successive electrons to secure complete reduction of O(2) to H(2)O at the active site. The two observed conformations of Glu76 are consistent with this residue playing the role of a base to deprotonate the amide moiety of Cys20 upon iron binding and transfer the resulting proton away, thus allowing the second oxidation to be electroneutral. The comparison of our structures also shows the existence of a dynamic chain of water molecules, resulting from O(2) reduction, located near the active site.</p>

<p>The targets of the Structural GenomiX (SGX) bacterial genomics project were proteins conserved in multiple prokaryotic organisms with no obvious sequence homolog in the Protein Data Bank of known structures. The outcome of this work was 80 structures, covering 60 unique sequences and 49 different genes. Experimental phase determination from proteins incorporating Se-Met was carried out for 45 structures with most of the remainder solved by molecular replacement using members of the experimentally phased set as search models. An automated tool was developed to deposit these structures in the Protein Data Bank, along with the associated X-ray diffraction data (including refined experimental phases) and experimentally confirmed sequences. BLAST comparisons of the SGX structures with structures that had appeared in the Protein Data Bank over the intervening 3.5 years since the SGX target list had been compiled identified homologs for 49 of the 60 unique sequences represented by the SGX structures. This result indicates that, for bacterial structures that are relatively easy to express, purify, and crystallize, the structural coverage of gene space is proceeding rapidly. More distant sequence-structure relationships between the SGX and PDB structures were investigated using PDB-BLAST and Combinatorial Extension (CE).

More distant sequence-structure relationships between the SGX and PDB structures were investigated using PDB-BLAST and Combinatorial Extension (CE). Only one structure, SufD, has a truly unique topology compared to all folds in the PDB.</p>

<p>The targets of the Structural GenomiX (SGX) bacterial genomics project were proteins conserved in multiple prokaryotic organisms with no obvious sequence homolog in the Protein Data Bank of known structures. The outcome of this work was 80 structures, covering 60 unique sequences and 49 different genes. Experimental phase determination from proteins incorporating Se-Met was carried out for 45 structures with most of the remainder solved by molecular replacement using members of the experimentally phased set as search models. An automated tool was developed to deposit these structures in the Protein Data Bank, along with the associated X-ray diffraction data (including refined experimental phases) and experimentally confirmed sequences.

<p>Tankyrases are ADP-ribosyltransferases that play key roles in various cellular pathways, including the regulation of cell proliferation, and thus, they are promising drug targets for the treatment of cancer. Flavones have been shown to inhibit tankyrases and we report here the discovery of more potent and selective flavone derivatives. Commercially available flavones with single substitutions were used for structure-activity relationship studies, and cocrystal structures of the 18 hit compounds were analyzed to explain their potency and selectivity. The most potent inhibitors were also tested in a cell-based assay, which demonstrated that they effectively antagonize Wnt signaling. To assess selectivity, they were further tested against a panel of homologous human ADP-ribosyltransferases. The most effective compound, 22 (MN-64), showed 6 nM potency against tankyrase 1, isoenzyme selectivity, and Wnt signaling inhibition. This work forms a basis for rational development of flavones as tankyrase inhibitors and guides the development of other structurally related inhibitors. </p>

<p>The diheme enzyme MauG catalyzes a six-electron oxidation required for post-translational modification of a precursor of methylamine dehydrogenase (preMADH) to complete the biosynthesis of its protein-derived tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor. Crystallographic studies have implicated Glu113 in the formation of the bis-Fe(IV) state of MauG, in which one heme is Fe(IV)═O and the other is Fe(IV) with His-Tyr axial ligation. An E113Q mutation had no effect on the structure of MauG but significantly altered its redox properties. E113Q MauG could not be converted to the diferrous state by reduction with dithionite but was only reduced to a mixed valence Fe(II)/Fe(III) state, which is never observed in wild-type (WT) MauG. Addition of H2O2 to E113Q MauG generated a high valence state that formed more slowly and was less stable than the bis-Fe(IV) state of WT MauG. E113Q MauG exhibited no detectable TTQ biosynthesis activity in a steady-state assay with preMADH as the substrate. It did catalyze the steady-state oxidation of quinol MADH to the quinone, but 1000-fold less efficiently than WT MauG. Addition of H2O2 to a crystal of the E113Q MauG-preMADH complex resulted in partial synthesis of TTQ. Extended exposure of these crystals to H2O2 resulted in hydroxylation of Pro107 in the distal pocket of the high-spin heme. It is concluded that the loss of the carboxylic group of Glu113 disrupts the redox cooperativity between hemes that allows rapid formation of the diferrous state and alters the distribution of high-valence species that participate in charge-resonance stabilization of the bis-Fe(IV) redox state. </p>

<p>Escherichia coli DsbD transports electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to periplasmic target proteins. DsbD is composed of an N-terminal (nDsbD) and a C-terminal (cDsbD) periplasmic domain, connected by a central transmembrane domain. Each domain possesses two cysteine residues essential for electron transport. The transport proceeds via disulfide exchange reactions from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to the central transmembrane domain and via cDsbD to nDsbD, which then reduces the periplasmic target proteins. We determined four high-resolution structures of cDsbD: oxidized (1.65 A resolution), chemically reduced (1.3 A), photo-reduced (1.1 A) and chemically reduced at pH increased from 4.6 to 7. The latter structure was refined at 0.99 A resolution, the highest achieved so far for a thioredoxin superfamily member. The data reveal unprecedented structural details of cDsbD, demonstrating that the domain is very rigid and undergoes hardly any conformational change upon disulfide reduction or interaction with nDsbD. In full agreement with the crystallographic results, guanidinium chloride-induced unfolding and refolding experiments indicate that oxidized and reduced cDsbD are equally stable. We confirmed the structural rigidity of cDsbD by molecular dynamics simulations. A remarkable feature of cDsbD is the pKa of 9.3 for the active site Cys461: this value, determined using two different experimental methods, surprisingly was around 2.5 units higher than expected on the basis of the redox potential. Additionally, taking advantage of the very high quality of the cDsbD structures, we carried out pKa calculations, which gave results in agreement with the experimental findings. In conclusion, our wide-scope analysis of cDsbD, encompassing atomic-resolution crystallography, computational chemistry and biophysical measurements, highlighted two so far unrecognized key aspects of this domain: its unusual redox properties and extreme rigidity. Both are likely to be correlated to the role of cDsbD as a covalently linked electron shuttle between the membrane domain and the N-terminal periplasmic domain of DsbD.</p>

<p>Haloalkane dehalogenases catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of carbon-halogen bonds, which is a key step in the aerobic mineralization of many environmental pollutants. One important pollutant is the toxic and anthropogenic compound 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP). Rational design was combined with saturation mutagenesis to obtain the haloalkane dehalogenase variant DhaA31, which displays an increased catalytic activity towards TCP. Here, the 1.31 Å resolution crystal structure of substrate-free DhaA31, the 1.26 Å resolution structure of DhaA31 in complex with TCP and the 1.95 Å resolution structure of wild-type DhaA are reported. Crystals of the enzyme-substrate complex were successfully obtained by adding volatile TCP to the reservoir after crystallization at pH 6.5 and room temperature. Comparison of the substrate-free structure with that of the DhaA31 enzyme-substrate complex reveals that the nucleophilic Asp106 changes its conformation from an inactive to an active state during the catalytic cycle. The positions of three chloride ions found inside the active site of the enzyme indicate a possible pathway for halide release from the active site through the main tunnel. Comparison of the DhaA31 variant with wild-type DhaA revealed that the introduced substitutions reduce the volume and the solvent-accessibility of the active-site pocket. </p>

<p>Betaine-homocysteine methyl transferase (BHMT) catalyzes the synthesis of methionine from betaine and homocysteine (Hcy), utilizing a zinc ion to activate Hcy. BHMT is a key liver enzyme that is important for homocysteine homeostasis. X-ray structures of human BHMT in its oxidized (Zn-free) and reduced (Zn-replete) forms, the latter in complex with the bisubstrate analog, S(delta-carboxybutyl)-L-homocysteine, were determined at resolutions of 2.15 A and 2.05 A. BHMT is a (beta/alpha)(8) barrel that is distorted to construct the substrate and metal binding sites. The zinc binding sequences G-V/L-N-C and G-G-C-C are at the C termini of strands beta6 and beta8. Oxidation to the Cys217-Cys299 disulfide and expulsion of Zn are accompanied by local rearrangements. The structures identify Hcy binding fingerprints and provide a prototype for the homocysteine S-methyltransferase family.</p>

<p>The class I terpenoid cyclase epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS) utilizes the universal achiral isoprenoid substrate, farnesyl diphosphate, to generate epi-isozizaene as the predominant sesquiterpene cyclization product and at least five minor sesquiterpene products, making EIZS an ideal platform for the exploration of fidelity and promiscuity in a terpenoid cyclization reaction. The hydrophobic active site contour of EIZS serves as a template that enforces a single substrate conformation, and chaperones subsequently formed carbocation intermediates through a well-defined mechanistic sequence. Here, we have used the crystal structure of EIZS as a guide to systematically remold the hydrophobic active site contour in a library of 26 site-specific mutants. Remolded cyclization templates reprogram the reaction cascade not only by reproportioning products generated by the wild-type enzyme but also by generating completely new products of diverse structure. Specifically, we have tripled the overall number of characterized products generated by EIZS. Moreover, we have converted EIZS into six different sesquiterpene synthases: F96A EIZS is an (E)-β-farnesene synthase, F96W EIZS is a zizaene synthase, F95H EIZS is a β-curcumene synthase, F95M EIZS is a β-acoradiene synthase, F198L EIZS is a β-cedrene synthase, and F96V EIZS and W203F EIZS are (Z)-γ-bisabolene synthases. Active site aromatic residues appear to be hot spots for reprogramming the cyclization cascade by manipulating the stability and conformation of critical carbocation intermediates. A majority of mutant enzymes exhibit only relatively modest 2-100-fold losses of catalytic activity, suggesting that residues responsible for triggering substrate ionization readily tolerate mutations deeper in the active site cavity. </p>

<p>Triclosan, a well-known inhibitor of Enoyl Acyl Carrier Protein Reductase (ENR) from several pathogenic organisms, is a promising lead compound to design effective drugs. We have solved the X-ray crystal structures of Plasmodium falciparum ENR in complex with triclosan variants having different substituted and unsubstituted groups at different key functional locations. The structures revealed that 4 and 2' substituted compounds have more interactions with the protein, cofactor, and solvents when compared with triclosan. New water molecules were found to interact with some of these inhibitors. Substitution at the 2' position of triclosan caused the relocation of a conserved water molecule, leading to an additional hydrogen bond with the inhibitor. This observation can help in conserved water-based inhibitor design. 2' and 4' unsubstituted compounds showed a movement away from the hydrophobic pocket to compensate for the interactions made by the halogen groups of triclosan. This compound also makes additional interactions with the protein and cofactor which compensate for the lost interactions due to the unsubstitution at 2' and 4'. In cell culture, this inhibitor shows less potency, which indicates that the chlorines at 2' and 4' positions increase the ability of the inhibitor to cross multilayered membranes. This knowledge helps us to modify the different functional groups of triclosan to get more potent inhibitors.</p>

<p>Azoreductases are important due to their ability to activate anti-inflammatory azo pro-drugs and to detoxify azo dyes. Three genes encoding azoreductases have been identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We describe here a comparison of the three enzymes. The pure recombinant proteins each have a distinct substrate specificity profile against a range of azo substrates. Using the structure of P. aeruginosa azoreductase (paAzoR) 1 and the homology models of paAzoR2 and paAzoR3, we have identified residues important for substrate specificity. We have defined a novel flavin mononucleotide binding cradle, which is a recurrent motif in many flavodoxin-like proteins. A novel structure of paAzoR1 with the azo pro-drug balsalazide bound within the active site was determined by X-ray crystallography and demonstrates that the substrate is present in a hydrazone tautomer conformation. We propose that the structure with balsalazide bound represents an enzyme intermediate and, together with the flavin mononucleotide binding cradle, we propose a novel catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection remains an important goal of global TB eradication. To this end, targets that are essential for intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are particularly attractive. Arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) represents such a target as it is, along with the enzymes encoded by the associated gene cluster, essential for mycobacterial survival inside macrophages and involved in cholesterol degradation. Cholesterol is likely to be the fuel for M. tuberculosis inside macrophages. Deleting the nat gene and inhibiting the NAT enzyme prevents survival of the microorganism in macrophages and induces cell wall alterations, rendering the mycobacterium sensitive to antibiotics to which it is normally resistant. To date, NAT from M. marinum (MMNAT) is considered the best available model for NAT from M. tuberculosis (TBNAT). The enzyme catalyses the acetylation and propionylation of arylamines and hydrazines. Hydralazine is a good acetyl and propionyl acceptor for both MMNAT and TBNAT. The MMNAT structure has been solved to 2.1 Å resolution following crystallisation in the presence of hydralazine and is compared to available NAT structures. From the mode of ligand binding, features of the binding pocket can be identified, which point to a novel mechanism for the acetylation reaction that results in a 3-methyltriazolo[3,4-a]phthalazine ring compound as product.</p>

<p>The reactivity of the [Re(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(2)](+) complex coordinated to the His15 residue of HEW lysozyme is described. In the fully metalated protein (Lys-1), the Re ion retains its reactivity only toward selected ligands, while others induce a ligand-mediated demetalation of the enzyme. It is further shown that some of the complexes that may be "engineered" on the lysozyme do not react with the free protein even if present in solution in excess. The formation of stable metal adducts starting from Lys-1 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.</p>

<p>Reflecting the diverse chemistry of plant cell walls, microorganisms that degrade these composite structures synthesize an array of glycoside hydrolases. These enzymes are organized into sequence-, mechanism-, and structure-based families. Genomic data have shown that several organisms that degrade the plant cell wall contain a large number of genes encoding family 43 (GH43) glycoside hydrolases. Here we report the biochemical properties of the GH43 enzymes of a saprophytic soil bacterium, Cellvibrio japonicus, and a human colonic symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The data show that C. japonicus uses predominantly exo-acting enzymes to degrade arabinan into arabinose, whereas B. thetaiotaomicron deploys a combination of endo- and side chain-cleaving glycoside hydrolases. Both organisms, however, utilize an arabinan-specific α-1,2-arabinofuranosidase in the degradative process, an activity that has not previously been reported. The enzyme can cleave α-1,2-arabinofuranose decorations in single or double substitutions, the latter being recalcitrant to the action of other arabinofuranosidases. The crystal structure of the C. japonicus arabinan-specific α-1,2-arabinofuranosidase, CjAbf43A, displays a five-bladed β-propeller fold. The specificity of the enzyme for arabinan is conferred by a surface cleft that is complementary to the helical backbone of the polysaccharide. The specificity of CjAbf43A for α-1,2-l-arabinofuranose side chains is conferred by a polar residue that orientates the arabinan backbone such that O2 arabinose decorations are directed into the active site pocket. A shelflike structure adjacent to the active site pocket accommodates O3 arabinose side chains, explaining how the enzyme can target O2 linkages that are components of single or double substitutions.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of several members of the nonphosphorylating CoA-independent aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family have shown that the peculiar binding mode of the cofactor to the Rossmann fold results in a conformational flexibility for the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor. This has been hypothesized to constitute an essential feature of the catalytic mechanism because the conformation of the cofactor required for the acylation step is not appropriate for the deacylation step. In the present study, the structure of a reaction intermediate of the E268A-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN) from Streptococcus mutans, obtained by soaking the crystals of the enzyme/NADP complex with the natural substrate, is reported. The substrate is bound covalently in the four monomers and presents the geometric characteristics expected for a thioacylenzyme intermediate. Control experiments assessed that reduction of the coenzyme has occurred within the crystal. The structure reveals that reduction of the cofactor upon acylation leads to an extensive motion of the nicotinamide moiety with a flip of the reduced pyridinium ring away from the active site without significant changes of the protein structure. This event positions the reduced nicotinamide moiety in a pocket that likely constitutes the exit door for NADPH. Arguments are provided that the structure reported here constitutes a reasonable picture of the first thioacylenzyme intermediate characterized thus far in the ALDH family and that the position of the reduced nicotinamide moiety observed in GAPN is the one suitable for the deacylation step within all of the nonphosphorylating CoA-independent ALDH family.</p>

<p>Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) have a gain-of-function effect leading to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG) accumulation. By using biochemical, structural and cellular assays, we show that either or both R- and S-2HG inhibit 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenases with varying potencies. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values for the R-form of 2HG varied from approximately 25 μM for the histone N(ɛ)-lysine demethylase JMJD2A to more than 5 mM for the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase. The results indicate that candidate oncogenic pathways in IDH-associated malignancy should include those that are regulated by other 2OG oxygenases than HIF hydroxylases, in particular those involving the regulation of histone methylation.</p>

<p>Human somatic angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a zinc-dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is central to the regulation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. It is a well-known target for combating hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. In a recent study by Bhuyan and Mugesh [Org. Biomol. Chem. (2011) 9, 1356-1365], it was shown that the selenium analogues of captopril (a well-known clinical inhibitor of ACE) not only inhibit ACE, but also protect against peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of peptides and proteins. Here, we report the crystal structures of human testis ACE (tACE) and a homologue of ACE, known as AnCE, from Drosophila melanogaster in complex with the most promising selenium analogue of captopril (SeCap) determined at 2.4 and 2.35 Å resolution, respectively. The inhibitor binds at the active site of tACE and AnCE in an analogous fashion to that observed for captopril and provide the first examples of a protein-selenolate interaction. These new structures of tACE-SeCap and AnCE-SeCap inhibitor complexes presented here provide important information for further exploration of zinc coordinating selenium-based ACE inhibitor pharmacophores with significant antioxidant activity.</p>

<p>Virtually all low molecular weight inhibitors of human glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) are highly polar compounds that have limited use in settings where more lipophilic molecules are desired. Here we report the identification and characterization of GCPII inhibitors with enhanced liphophilicity that are derived from a series of newly identified dipeptidic GCPII substrates featuring nonpolar aliphatic side chains at the C-terminus. To analyze the interactions governing the substrate recognition by GCPII, we determined crystal structures of the inactive GCPII(E424A) mutant in complex with selected dipeptides and complemented the structural data with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. Results reveal the importance of nonpolar interactions governing GCPII affinity toward novel substrates as well as formerly unnoticed plasticity of the S1' specificity pocket. On the basis of those data, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of novel GCPII inhibitors with enhanced lipophilicity, with the best candidates having low nanomolar inhibition constants and clogD &gt; -0.3. Our findings offer new insights into the design of more lipophilic inhibitors targeting GCPII.</p>

<p>The structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis dUTP nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) has been determined at 1.3 Angstrom resolution in complex with magnesium ion and the non-hydrolyzable substrate analog, alpha,beta-imido dUTP. dUTPase is an enzyme essential for depleting potentially toxic concentrations of dUTP in the cell. Given the importance of its biological role, it has been proposed that inhibiting M.tuberculosis dUTPase might be an effective means to treat tuberculosis infection in humans. The crystal structure presented here offers some insight into the potential for designing a specific inhibitor of the M.tuberculosis dUTPase enzyme. The structure also offers new insights into the mechanism of dUTP hydrolysis by providing an accurate representation of the enzyme-substrate complex in which both the metal ion and dUTP analog are included. The structure suggests that inclusion of a magnesium ion is important for stabilizing the position of the alpha-phosphorus for an in-line nucleophilic attack. In the absence of magnesium, the alpha-phosphate of dUTP can have either of the two positions which differ by 4.5 Angstrom. A transiently ordered C-terminal loop further assists catalysis by shielding the general base, Asp83, from solvent thus elevating its pK(a) so that it might in turn activate a tightly bound water molecule for nucleophilic attack. The metal ion coordinates alpha, beta, and gamma phosphate groups with tridentate geometry identical with that observed in the crystal structure of DNA polymerase beta complexed with magnesium and dNTP analog, revealing some common features in catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>The enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis have been identified as attractive targets with novel modes of action for the development of herbicides for crop protection and agents against infectious diseases. This pathway is present in many pathogenic organisms and plants, but absent in mammals. By using high-throughput screening, we identified highly halogenated marine natural products, the pseudilins, to be inhibitors of the third enzyme, IspD, in the pathway. Their activity against the IspD enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Plasmodium vivax was determined in photometric and NMR-based assays. Cocrystal structures revealed that pseudilins bind to an allosteric pocket by using both divalent metal ion coordination and halogen bonding. The allosteric mode of action for preventing cosubstrate (CTP) binding at the active site was elucidated. Pseudilins show herbicidal activity in plant assays and antiplasmodial activity in cell-based assays.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the enzyme phosphoglucomutase from Salmonella typhimurium (StPGM) is reported at 1.7 A resolution. This is the first high-resolution structural characterization of a bacterial protein from this large enzyme family, which has a central role in metabolism and is also important to bacterial virulence and infectivity. A comparison of the active site of StPGM with that of other phosphoglucomutases reveals conserved residues that are likely involved in catalysis and ligand binding for the entire enzyme family. An alternate crystal form of StPGM and normal mode analysis give insights into conformational changes of the C-terminal domain that occur upon ligand binding. A novel observation from the StPGM structure is an apparent dimer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, mediated largely through contacts in an N-terminal helix. Analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering confirm that StPGM forms a dimer in solution. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic studies show that a distinct subset of bacterial PGMs share the signature dimerization helix, while other bacterial and eukaryotic PGMs are likely monomers. These structural, biochemical, and bioinformatic studies of StPGM provide insights into the large α-D-phosphohexomutase enzyme superfamily to which it belongs, and are also relevant to the design of inhibitors specific to the bacterial PGMs.</p>

<p>Macrophage infectivity potentiators (Mips) are immunophilin proteins and essential virulence factors for a range of pathogenic organisms. We applied a structural biology approach to characterize a Mip from Burkholderia pseudomallei (BpML1), the causative agent of melioidosis. Crystal structure and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of BpML1 in complex with known macrocyclics and other derivatives led to the identification of a key chemical scaffold. This scaffold possesses inhibitory potency for BpML1 without the immunosuppressive components of related macrocyclic agents. Biophysical characterization of a compound series with this scaffold allowed binding site specificity in solution and potency determinations for rank ordering the set. The best compounds in this series possessed a low-micromolar affinity for BpML1, bound at the site of enzymatic activity, and inhibited a panel of homologous Mip proteins from other pathogenic bacteria, without demonstrating toxicity in human macrophages. Importantly, the in vitro activity of BpML1 was reduced by these compounds, leading to decreased macrophage infectivity and intracellular growth of Burkholderia pseudomallei. These compounds offer the potential for activity against a new class of antimicrobial targets and present the utility of a structure-based approach for novel antimicrobial drug discovery. </p>

<p>7,8-Dihydro-8-oxoguanine (oxoG), the predominant oxidative DNA damage lesion, is processed differently by high-fidelity and Y-family lesion bypass polymerases. Although high-fidelity polymerases extend predominantly from an A base opposite an oxoG, the Y-family polymerases Dpo4 and human Pol eta preferentially extend from the oxoG*C base pair. We have determined crystal structures of extension Dpo4 ternary complexes with oxoG opposite C, A, G, or T and the next nascent base pair. We demonstrate that neither template backbone nor the architecture of the active site is perturbed by the oxoG(anti)*C and oxoG*A pairs. However, the latter manifest conformational heterogeneity, adopting both oxoG(syn)*A(anti) and oxoG(anti)*A(syn) alignment. Hence, the observed reduced primer extension from the dynamically flexible 3'-terminal primer base A is explained. Because of homology between Dpo4 and Pol eta, such a dynamic screening mechanism might be utilized by Dpo4 and Pol eta to regulate error-free versus error-prone bypass of oxoG and other lesions.</p>

<p>Bis-(3',5') cyclic di-guanylate (c-di-GMP) is a key bacterial second messenger that is implicated in the regulation of many crucial processes that include biofilm formation, motility and virulence. Cellular levels of c-di-GMP are controlled through synthesis by GGDEF domain diguanylate cyclases and degradation by two classes of phosphodiesterase with EAL or HD-GYP domains. Here, we have determined the structure of an enzymatically active HD-GYP domain protein from Persephonella marina (PmGH) alone, in complex with substrate (c-di-GMP) and final reaction product (GMP). The structures reveal a novel trinuclear iron binding site, which is implicated in catalysis and identify residues involved in recognition of c-di-GMP. This structure completes the picture of all domains involved in c-di-GMP metabolism and reveals that the HD-GYP family splits into two distinct subgroups containing bi- and trinuclear metal centres.</p>

<p>Crystal structures in both oxidized and reduced forms are reported for two bacterial cytochrome c oxidase mutants that define the D and K proton paths, showing conformational change in response to reduction and the loss of strategic waters that can account for inhibition of proton transfer. In the oxidized state both mutants of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides enzyme, D132A and K362M, show overall structures similar to wild type, indicating no long-range effects of mutation. In the reduced state, the mutants show an altered conformation similar to that seen in reduced wild type, confirming this reproducible, reversible response to reduction. In the strongly inhibited D132A mutant, positions of residues and waters in the D pathway are unaffected except in the entry region close to the mutation, where a chloride ion replaces the missing carboxyl and a 2-Å shift in N207 results in loss of its associated water. In K362M, the methionine occupies the same position as the original lysine, but K362- and T359-associated waters in the wild-type structure are missing, likely accounting for the severe inhibition. Spectra of oxidized frozen crystals taken during X-ray radiation show metal center reduction, but indicate development of a strained configuration that only relaxes to a native form upon annealing. Resistance of the frozen crystal to structural change clarifies why the oxidized conformation is observable and supports the conclusion that the reduced conformation has functional significance. A mechanism is described that explains the conformational change and the incomplete response of the D-path mutant.</p>

In K362M, the methionine occupies the same position as the original lysine, but K362- and T359-associated waters in the wild-type structure are missing, likely accounting for the severe inhibition. Spectra of oxidized frozen crystals taken during X-ray radiation show metal center reduction, but indicate development of a strained configuration that only relaxes to a native form upon annealing. Resistance of the frozen crystal to structural change clarifies why the oxidized conformation is observable and supports the conclusion that the reduced conformation has functional significance. A mechanism is described that explains the conformational change and the incomplete response of the D-path mutant.</p>

<p>Crystal structures in both oxidized and reduced forms are reported for two bacterial cytochrome c oxidase mutants that define the D and K proton paths, showing conformational change in response to reduction and the loss of strategic waters that can account for inhibition of proton transfer. In the oxidized state both mutants of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides enzyme, D132A and K362M, show overall structures similar to wild type, indicating no long-range effects of mutation.

<p>IQA [[5-oxo-5,6-dihydro-indolo(1,2-a)quinazolin-7-yl]acetic acid] is a novel ATP/GTP site-directed inhibitor of CK2 ('casein kinase 2'), a pleiotropic and constitutively active protein kinase whose activity is abnormally high in transformed cells. The K (i) value of IQA (0.17 microM) is lower than those of other CK2 inhibitors reported so far. Tested at 10 microM concentration in the presence of 100 microM ATP, IQA almost suppresses CK2 activity in vitro, whereas it is ineffective or weakly effective on a panel of 44 protein kinases and on phosphoinositide 3-kinase. In comparison, other CK2 inhibitors, notably apigenin and quercetin, are more promiscuous. The in vivo efficacy of IQA has been assessed by using the fact that treatment of Jurkat cells with IQA inhibits endogenous CK2 in a dose-dependent manner. IQA has been co-crystallized with maize CK2alpha, which is &gt;70% identical with its human homologue, and the structure of the complex has been determined at 1.68 A (1 A=0.1 nm) resolution. The inhibitor lies in the same plane occupied by the purine moiety of ATP with its more hydrophobic side facing the hinge region. Major contributions to the interaction are provided by hydrophobic forces and non-polar interactions involving the aromatic portion of the inhibitor and the hydrophobic residues surrounding the ATP-binding pocket, with special reference to the side chains of V53 (Val53), I66, M163 and I174. Consequently, mutants of human CK2alpha in which either V66 (the homologue of maize CK2alpha I66) or I174 is replaced by alanine are considerably less sensitive to IQA inhibition when compared with wild-type. These results provide new tools for deciphering the enigmatic role of CK2 in living cells and may pave the way for the development of drugs depending on CK2 activity.</p>

<p>Electrophilic halogenation of C-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl) 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (1) afforded regioselectively products halogenated at the para position to the D-glucosyl moiety (8, 9) that were deacetylated to 3 (chloride) and 16 (bromide). For preparing meta regioisomers, 1 was efficiently oxidized with CAN to afford C-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl) 1,4-benzoquinone 2 which, in either MeOH or H(2)O-THF containing few equivalents of AcCl, added hydrochloric acid to produce predominantly meta (with respect to the sugar moiety) chlorinated hydroquinone derivatives 5 and 18, this latter being deacetylated to 4. The deacetylated meta (4, 5) or para (3, 16) halohydroquinones were evaluated as inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase (GP, a molecular target for inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis under high glucose concentrations) by kinetics and X-ray crystallography. These compounds are competitive inhibitors of GPb with respect to α-D-glucose-1-phosphate. The measured IC(50) values (μM) [169.9±10.0 (3), 95 (4), 39.8±0.3 (5) 136.4±4.9 (16)] showed that the meta halogenated inhibitors (4, 5) are more potent than their para analogs (3, 16). The crystal structures of GPb in complex with these compounds at high resolution (1.97-2.05 Å) revealed that the inhibitors are accommodated at the catalytic site and stabilize the T conformation of the enzyme. The differences in their inhibitory potency can be interpreted in terms of variations in the interactions with protein residues of the different substituents on the aromatic part of the inhibitors.</p>

<p>We present a combined experimental and modeling study of organic ligand molecules binding to a slightly polar engineered cavity site in T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). For modeling, we computed alchemical absolute binding free energies. These were blind tests performed prospectively on 13 diverse, previously untested candidate ligand molecules. We predicted that eight compounds would bind to the cavity and five would not; 11 of 13 predictions were correct at this level. The RMS error to the measurable absolute binding energies was 1.8 kcal/mol. In addition, we computed "relative" binding free energies for six phenol derivatives starting from two known ligands: phenol and catechol. The average RMS error in the relative free energy prediction was 2.5 kcal/mol (phenol) and 1.1 kcal/mol (catechol). To understand these results at atomic resolution, we obtained x-ray co-complex structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol analogs. The average RMSD of the predicted pose to the experiment was 2.0 A (diverse set), 1.8 A (phenol-derived predictions), and 1.2 A (catechol-derived predictions). We found that predicting accurate affinities and rank-orderings required near-native starting orientations of the ligand in the binding site. Unanticipated binding modes, multiple ligand binding, and protein conformational change all proved challenging for the free energy methods. We believe that these results can help guide future improvements in physics-based absolute binding free energy methods.</p>

<p>Parasites from the protozoan phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for diseases, such as malaria, toxoplasmosis and cryptosporidiosis, all of which have significantly higher rates of mortality and morbidity in economically underdeveloped regions of the world. Advances in vaccine development and drug discovery are urgently needed to control these diseases and can be facilitated by production of purified recombinant proteins from Apicomplexan genomes and determination of their 3D structures. To date, both heterologous expression and crystallization of Apicomplexan proteins have seen only limited success. In an effort to explore the effectiveness of producing and crystallizing proteins on a genome-scale using a standardized methodology, over 400 distinct Plasmodium falciparum target genes were chosen representing different cellular classes, along with select orthologues from four other Plasmodium species as well as Cryptosporidium parvum and Toxoplasma gondii. From a total of 1008 genes from the seven genomes, 304 (30.2%) produced purified soluble proteins and 97 (9.6%) crystallized, culminating in 36 crystal structures. These results demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, a standardized platform using Escherichia coli can be effective for genome-scale production and crystallography of Apicomplexan proteins. Predictably, orthologous proteins from different Apicomplexan genomes behaved differently in expression, purification and crystallization, although the overall success rates of Plasmodium orthologues do not differ significantly. Their differences were effectively exploited to elevate the overall productivity to levels comparable to the most successful ongoing structural genomics projects: 229 of the 468 target genes produced purified soluble protein from one or more organisms, with 80 and 32 of the purified targets, respectively, leading to crystals and ultimately structures from one or more orthologues.</p>

<p>Sulfite reductase catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide. The active site, found in the hemoprotein subunit (SiRHP), sits on the distal face of a negatively charged porphyrinoid called siroheme whose central iron atom is coupled to a proximal Fe(4)S(4) cluster. Four positively charged amino acids are positioned around the active site cavity. Together, these two arginines (R83 and R153) and two lysines (K215 and K217) mitigate the negative charge on the siroheme macrocycle. They also serve as a cage around the distally bound anion that tightens when substrate binds and an active site loop clamps down. Structures of native SiRHP point to these amino acids as being important, but their specific roles are ill-defined. Here, we have altered those four active site amino acids and one amino acid on the flexible loop (N149) to probe their roles in SiRHP activity. None of these positively charged residues is required for electron transfer, but only R83S and N149W variants can produce a fully reduced product. By measuring the electrons used per unit of reduced sulfur released, we show that K215, R153, and K217 are responsible for intermediate and late proton transfers, whereas N149 and R153 play a role in the structure of the flexible loop that controls anion binding and release. R83 is primarily responsible for siroheme binding. Together, the activities and structures of these variants reveal specific roles for each in anion binding and in coupled proton transfer that facilitates electron transfer.</p>

<p>Glutaraldehyde has been used for several decades as an effective crosslinking agent for many applications including sample fixation for microscopy, enzyme and cell immobilization, and stabilization of protein crystals. Despite of its common use as a crosslinking agent, the mechanism and chemistry involved in glutaraldehyde crosslinking reaction is not yet fully understood. Here we describe feasibility study and results obtained from a new approach to investigate the process of protein crystals stabilization by glutaraldehyde crosslinking. It involves exposure of a model protein crystal (Lysozyme) to glutaraldehyde in alkaline or acidic pH for different incubation periods and reaction arrest by medium exchange with crystallization medium to remove unbound glutaraldehyde. The crystals were subsequently incubated in diluted buffer affecting dissolution of un-crosslinked crystals. Samples from the resulting solution were subjected to protein composition analysis by gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy while crosslinked, dissolution resistant crystals were subjected to high resolution X-ray structural analysis. Data from gel electrophoresis indicated that the crosslinking process starts at specific preferable crosslinking site by lysozyme dimer formation, for both acidic and alkaline pH values. These dimer formations were followed by trimer and tetramer formations leading eventually to dissolution resistant crystals. The crosslinking initiation site and the end products obtained from glutaraldehyde crosslinking in both pH ranges resulted from reactions between lysine residues of neighboring protein molecules and the polymeric form of glutaraldehyde. Reaction rate was much faster at alkaline pH. Different reaction end products, indicating different reaction mechanisms, were identified for crosslinking taking place under alkaline or acidic conditions.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of glutamine synthetase (GS) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis determined at 2.4 A resolution reveals citrate and AMP bound in the active site. The structure was refined with strict 24-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints and has an R-factor of 22.7% and an R-free of 25.5%. Multicopy refinement using 10 atomic models and strict 24-fold NCS constraints further reduced the R-factor to 20.4% and the R-free to 23.2%. The multicopy model demonstrates the range of atomic displacements of catalytic and regulatory loops in glutamine synthesis, simulating loop motions. A comparison with loop positions in substrate complexes of GS from Salmonella typhimurium shows that the Asp50 and Glu327 loops close over the active site during catalysis. These loop closures are preceded by a conformational change of the Glu209 beta-strand upon metal ion or ATP binding that converts the enzyme from a relaxed to a taut state. We propose a model of the GS regulatory mechanism based on the loop motions in which adenylylation of the Tyr397 loop reverses the effect of metal ion binding, and regulates intermediate formation by preventing closure of the Glu327 loop.</p>

<p>A series of 4-substituted-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenezenesulfonamides were synthesized and their binding potencies as inhibitors of recombinant human carbonic anhydrase isozymes I, II, VII, XII, and XIII were determined by the thermal shift assay, isothermal titration calorimetry, and stop-flow CO2 hydration assay. All fluorinated benzenesulfonamides exhibited nanomolar binding potency toward tested CAs and fluorinated benzenesulfonamides posessed higher binding potency than non-fluorinated compounds. The crystal structures of 4-[(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)thio]-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzenesulfonamide in complex with CA II and CA XII, and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-[(2-hydroxyethyl)sulfonyl]benzenesulfonamide in complex with CA XIII were determined. The observed dissociation constants for several fluorinated compounds reached subnanomolar range for CA I isozyme. The affinity and the selectivity of the compounds towards tested isozymes are presented.</p>

<p>Improvements on the computational methods for affinity prediction from the structure of protein-ligand complexes require a better understanding of the nature of molecular interactions and biomolecular recognition principles. In the present contribution, the binding of two chemically closely related human aldose reductase inhibitors had been studied by high-resolution X-ray analysis (0.92-1.35 Ǻ) and isothermal titration calorimetry against a series of single-site mutants of the wild-type protein. A crucial threonine thought to be involved in a short bromine-to-oxygen halogen bond to the inhibitors in the wild type has been mutated to the structurally similar residues alanine, cysteine, serine and valine. Overall, structurally, the binding mode of the inhibitors is conserved; however, small but significant geometrical adaptations are observed as a consequence of the spatial and electronic changes at the mutation site. They involve the opening of a central bond angle and shifts in consequence of the lost or gained halogen bonds. Remarkably, the tiny structural changes are responded by partly strong modulation of the thermodynamic profiles. Even though the free energy of binding is maximally perturbed by only 7 kJ/mol, much stronger modulations and shifts in the enthalpy and entropy signatures are revealed, which indicate a pronounced enthalpy/entropy compensation. However, an explanatory correlation can be detected when facing these perturbances against the small structural changes. This also provides deeper insights into how single-site mutations can alter the selectivity profile of closely related ligands against a target protein.</p>

<p>A 2-amino-5-aryl-pyrazine was identified as an inhibitor of human lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) via a biochemical screening campaign. Biochemical and biophysical experiments demonstrated that the compound specifically interacted with human LDHA. Structural variation of the screening hit resulted in improvements in LDHA biochemical inhibition and pharmacokinetic properties. A crystal structure of an improved compound bound to human LDHA was also obtained and it explained many of the observed structure-activity relationships. </p>

<p>The oxidative degradation of biphenyl and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is initiated in Pandoraea pnomenusa B-356 by biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO(B356)). BPDO(B356), a heterohexameric (αβ)(3) Rieske oxygenase (RO), catalyzes the insertion of dioxygen with stereo- and regioselectivity at the 2,3-carbons of biphenyl, and can transform a broad spectrum of PCB congeners. Here we present the X-ray crystal structures of BPDO(B356) with and without its substrate biphenyl 1.6-Å resolution for both structures. In both cases, the Fe(II) has five ligands in a square pyramidal configuration: H233 Nε2, H239 Nε2, D386 Oδ1 and Oδ2, and a single water molecule. Analysis of the active sites of BPDO(B356) and related ROs revealed structural features that likely contribute to the superior PCB-degrading ability of certain BPDOs. First, the active site cavity readily accommodates biphenyl with minimal conformational rearrangement. Second, M231 was predicted to sterically interfere with binding of some PCBs, and substitution of this residue yielded variants that transform 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl more effectively. Third, in addition to the volume and shape of the active site, residues at the active site entrance also apparently influence substrate preference. Finally, comparison of the conformation of the active site entrance loop among ROs provides a basis for a structure-based classification consistent with a phylogeny derived from amino acid sequence alignments.</p>

<p>The topoisomerase II (topo II) DNA incision-and-ligation cycle can be poisoned (for example following treatment with cancer chemotherapeutics) to generate cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with topo II covalently conjugated to DNA. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (Tdp2) protects genomic integrity by reversing 5'-phosphotyrosyl-linked topo II-DNA adducts. Here, X-ray structures of mouse Tdp2-DNA complexes reveal that Tdp2 β-2-helix-β DNA damage-binding 'grasp', helical 'cap' and DNA lesion-binding elements fuse to form an elongated protein-DNA conjugate substrate-interaction groove. The Tdp2 DNA-binding surface is highly tailored for engagement of 5'-adducted single-stranded DNA ends and restricts nonspecific endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic processing. Structural, mutational and functional analyses support a single-metal ion catalytic mechanism for the exonuclease-endonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) nuclease superfamily and establish a molecular framework for targeted small-molecule blockade of Tdp2-mediated resistance to anticancer topoisomerase drugs.</p>

<p>All natural tetrapyrroles, including hemes, chlorophylls and vitamin B12, share porphobilinogen (PBG) as a common precursor. Porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) synthesizes PBG through the asymmetric condensation of two molecules of aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Crystal structures of PBGS from various sources confirm the presence of two distinct binding sites for each ALA molecule, termed A and P. We have solved the structure of the active-site variant D139N of the Mg2+-dependent PBGS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in complex with the inhibitor 5-fluorolevulinic acid at high resolution. Uniquely, full occupancy of both substrate binding sites each by a single substrate-like molecule was observed. Both inhibitor molecules are covalently bound to two conserved, active-site lysine residues, Lys205 and Lys260, through Schiff bases. The active site now also contains a monovalent cation that may critically enhance enzymatic activity. Based on these structural data, we postulate a catalytic mechanism for P. aeruginosa PBGS initiated by a C-C bond formation between A and P-side ALA, followed by the formation of the intersubstrate Schiff base yielding the product PBG.</p>

<p>Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) remove the initiator methionine during protein biosynthesis. They exist in two isoforms, MetAP1 and MetAP2. The anti-angiogenic compound fumagillin binds tightly to the Type 2 MetAPs but only weakly to Type 1. High-affinity complexes of fumagillin and its relative ovalicin with Type 2 human MetAP have been reported. Here we describe the crystallographic structure of the low-affinity complex between ovalicin and Type 1 human MetAP at 1.1 A resolution. This provides the first opportunity to compare the structures of ovalicin or fumagillin bound to a Type 1 and a Type 2 MetAP. For both Type 1 and Type 2 human MetAPs the inhibitor makes a covalent adduct with a corresponding histidine. At the same time there are significant differences in the alignment of the inhibitors within the respective active sites. It has been argued that the lower affinity of ovalicin and fumagillin for the Type 1 MetAPs is due to the smaller size of their active sites relative to the Type 2 enzymes. Comparison with the uncomplexed structure of human Type 1 MetAP indicates that there is some truth to this. Several active site residues have to move "outward" by 0.5 Angstroms or so to accommodate the inhibitor. Other residues move "inward." There are, however, other factors that come into play. In particular, the side chain of His310 rotates by 134 degrees into a different position where (together with Glu128 and Tyr195) it coordinates a metal ion not seen at this site in the native enzyme.</p>

<p>PaBADH (Pseudomonas aeruginosa betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase) catalyses the irreversible NAD(P)+-dependent oxidation of betaine aldehyde to its corresponding acid, the osmoprotector glycine betaine. This reaction is involved in the catabolism of choline and in the response of this important pathogen to the osmotic and oxidative stresses prevalent in infection sites. The crystal structure of PaBADH in complex with NADPH showed a novel covalent adduct between the C2N of the pyridine ring and the sulfur atom of the catalytic cysteine residue, Cys286. This kind of adduct has not been reported previously either for a cysteine residue or for a low-molecular-mass thiol. The Michael addition of the cysteine thiolate in the 'resting' conformation to the double bond of the α,β-unsaturated nicotinamide is facilitated by the particular conformation of NADPH in the active site of PaBADH (also observed in the crystal structure of the Cys286Ala mutant) and by an ordered water molecule hydrogen bonded to the carboxamide group. Reversible formation of NAD(P)H-Cys286 adducts in solution causes reversible enzyme inactivation as well as the loss of Cys286 reactivity towards thiol-specific reagents. This novel covalent modification may provide a physiologically relevant regulatory mechanism of the irreversible PaBADH-catalysed reaction, preventing deleterious decreases in the intracellular NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratios.</p>

<p>The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is essential for the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links. At the heart of this pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 (ID) complex by the multiprotein "core complex" containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase FANCL. Vertebrate organisms have the eight-protein core complex, whereas invertebrates apparently do not. We report here the structure of the central domain of human FANCL in comparison with the recently solved Drosophila melanogaster FANCL. Our data represent the first structural detail into the catalytic core of the human system and reveal that the central fold of FANCL is conserved between species. However, there are macromolecular differences between the FANCL proteins that may account for the apparent distinctions in core complex requirements between the vertebrate and invertebrate FA pathways. In addition, we characterize the binding of human FANCL with its partners, Ube2t, FANCD2, and FANCI. Mutational analysis reveals which residues are required for substrate binding, and we also show the domain required for E2 binding.</p>

<p>A congeneric series of benzamidine-type ligands with a central proline moiety and a terminal cycloalkyl group--linked by a secondary amine, ether, or methylene bridge--was synthesized as trypsin inhibitors. This series of inhibitors was investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry, crystal structure analysis in two crystal forms, and molecular dynamics simulations. Even though all of these congeneric ligands exhibited essentially the same affinity for trypsin, their binding profiles at the structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic levels are very distinct. The ligands display a pronounced enthalpy/entropy compensation that results in a nearly unchanged free energy of binding, even though individual enthalpy and entropy terms change significantly across the series. Crystal structures revealed that the secondary amine-linked analogs scatter over two distinct conformational families of binding modes that occupy either the inside or of the outside the protein's S3/S4 specificity pocket. In contrast, the ether-linked and methylene-linked ligands preferentially occupy the hydrophobic specificity pocket. This also explains why the latter ligands could only be crystallized in the conformationally restricting closed crystal form whereas the derivative with the highest residual mobility in the series escaped our attempts to crystallize it in the closed form; instead, a well-resolved structure could only be achieved in the open form with the ligand in disordered orientation. These distinct binding modes are supported by molecular dynamics simulations and correlate with the shifting enthalpic/entropic signatures of ligand binding. The examples demonstrate that, at the molecular level, binding modes and thermodynamic binding signatures can be very different even for closely related ligands. However, deviating binding profiles provide the opportunity to optimally address a given target.</p>

<p>Human somatic angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a zinc-dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is central to the regulation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. It is a well-known target for combating hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. In a recent study by Bhuyan and Mugesh [Org. Biomol. Chem. (2011) 9, 1356-1365], it was shown that the selenium analogues of captopril (a well-known clinical inhibitor of ACE) not only inhibit ACE, but also protect against peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of peptides and proteins. Here, we report the crystal structures of human testis ACE (tACE) and a homologue of ACE, known as AnCE, from Drosophila melanogaster in complex with the most promising selenium analogue of captopril (SeCap) determined at 2.4 and 2.35 Å resolution, respectively. The inhibitor binds at the active site of tACE and AnCE in an analogous fashion to that observed for captopril and provide the first examples of a protein-selenolate interaction. These new structures of tACE-SeCap and AnCE-SeCap inhibitor complexes presented here provide important information for further exploration of zinc coordinating selenium-based ACE inhibitor pharmacophores with significant antioxidant activity.</p>

<p>Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is a family of enzymes that utilizes ATP and methionine to produce S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the most crucial methyl donor in the biological methylation of biomolecules and bioactive natural products. Here, we report that the MAT from Sulfolobus solfataricus (sMAT), an enzyme from a poorly explored class of the MAT family, has the ability to produce a range of differentially alkylated AdoMet analogs in the presence of non-native methionine analogs and ATP. To investigate the molecular basis for AdoMet analog production, we have crystallized the sMAT in the AdoMet bound, S-adenosylethionine (AdoEth) bound and unbound forms. Notably, among these structures, the AdoEth bound form offers the first MAT structure containing a non-native product, and cumulatively these structures add new structural insight into the MAT family and allow for detailed active site comparison with its homologs in Escherichia coli and human. As a thermostable MAT structure from archaea, the structures herein also provide a basis for future engineering to potentially broaden AdoMet analog production as reagents for methyltransferase-catalyzed 'alkylrandomization' and/or the study of methylation in the context of biological processes.</p>

<p>Tankyrases are ADP-ribosyltransferases that play key roles in various cellular pathways, including the regulation of cell proliferation, and thus, they are promising drug targets for the treatment of cancer. Flavones have been shown to inhibit tankyrases and we report here the discovery of more potent and selective flavone derivatives. Commercially available flavones with single substitutions were used for structure-activity relationship studies, and cocrystal structures of the 18 hit compounds were analyzed to explain their potency and selectivity. The most potent inhibitors were also tested in a cell-based assay, which demonstrated that they effectively antagonize Wnt signaling. To assess selectivity, they were further tested against a panel of homologous human ADP-ribosyltransferases. The most effective compound, 22 (MN-64), showed 6 nM potency against tankyrase 1, isoenzyme selectivity, and Wnt signaling inhibition. This work forms a basis for rational development of flavones as tankyrase inhibitors and guides the development of other structurally related inhibitors. </p>

<p>Druglike molecules are defined by Lipinski's rule of 5, to characterize fragment thresholds, they have been reduced from 5 to 3 (Astex's rule of 3). They are applied to assemble fragment libraries, and providers use them to select fragments for commercial offer. We question whether these rules are too stringent to compose fragment libraries with candidates exhibiting sufficient room for chemical subsequent growing and merging modifications as appropriate functional groups for chemical transformations are required. Usually these groups exhibit properties as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors and provide entry points for optimization chemistry. We therefore designed a fragment library (364 entries) without strictly applying the rule of 3. For initial screening for endothiapepsin binding, we performed a biochemical cleavage assay of a fluorogenic substrate at 1 mM. "Hits" were defined to inhibit the enzyme by at least 40%. Fifty-five hits were suggested and subsequently soaked into endothiapepsin crystals. Eleven crystal structures could be determined covering fragments with diverse binding modes: (i) direct binding to the catalytic dyad aspartates, (ii) water-mediated binding to the aspartates, (iii) no direct interaction with the dyad. They occupy different specificity pockets. Only 4 of the 11 fragments are consistent with the rule of 3. Restriction to this rule would have limited the fragment hits to a strongly reduced variety of chemotypes.</p>

<p>Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are the most common non-catalytic modules associated with enzymes active in plant cell-wall hydrolysis. Despite the large number of putative CBMs being identified by amino acid sequence alignments, only few representatives have been experimentally shown to have a carbohydrate-binding function. Caldicellulosiruptor strain Rt8B.4 Man26 is a thermostable modular glycoside hydrolase beta-mannanase which contains two non-catalytic modules in tandem at its N terminus. These modules were recently shown to function primarily as beta-mannan-binding modules and have accordingly been classified as members of a novel family of CBMs, family 27. The N-terminal CBM27 (CsCBM27-1) of Man26 from Caldicellulosiruptor Rt8B.4 displays high-binding affinity towards mannohexaose with a Ka of 1 x 10(7) M(-1). Accordingly, the high-resolution crystal structures of CsCBM27-1 native and its mannohexaose complex were solved at 1.55 angstroms and 1.06 angstoms resolution, respectively. In the crystal, CsCBM27-1 shows the typical beta-sandwich jellyroll fold observed in other CBMs with a single metal ion bound, which was identified as calcium. The crystal structures reveal that the overall fold of CsCBM27-1 remains virtually unchanged upon sugar binding and that binding is mediated by three solvent-exposed tryptophan residues and few direct hydrogen bonds. Based on binding affinity and thermal unfolding experiments this structural calcium is shown to play a role in the thermal stability of CsCBM27-1 at high temperatures. The higher binding affinity of CsCBM27-1 to mannooligosaccharides when compared to other members of CBM family 27 might be explained by the different orientation of the residues forming the "aromatic platform" and by differences in the length of loops. Finally, evidence is presented, on the basis of fold similarities and the retention of the position of conserved motifs and a calcium ion, for the consolidation of related CBM families into a superfamily of CBMs.</p>

<p>The serine protease thrombin plays multiple roles in many important physiological processes, especially coagulation, where it functions as both a pro- and anticoagulant. The polyanionic glycosaminoglycan heparin modulates thrombin's activity through binding at exosite II. Sucrose octasulfate (SOS) is often used as a surrogate for heparin, but it is not known whether it is an effective heparin mimic in its interaction with thrombin. We have characterized the interaction of SOS with thrombin in solution and determined a crystal structure of their complex. SOS binds thrombin with a K(d) of ~1.4 μM, comparable to that of the much larger polymeric heparin measured under the same conditions. Nonionic (hydrogen bonding) interactions make a larger contribution to thrombin binding of SOS than to heparin. SOS binding to exosite II inhibits thrombin's catalytic activity with high potency but with low efficacy. Analytical ultracentrifugation shows that bovine and human thrombins are monomers in solution in the presence of SOS, in contrast to their complexes with heparin, which are dimers. In the X-ray crystal structure, two molecules of SOS are bound nonequivalently to exosite II portions of a thrombin dimer, in contrast to the 1:2 stoichiometry of the heparin-thrombin complex, which has a different monomer association mode in the dimer. SOS and heparin binding to exosite II of thrombin differ on both chemical and structural levels and, perhaps most significantly, in thrombin inhibition. These differences may offer paths to the design of more potent exosite II binding, allosteric small molecules as modulators of thrombin function.</p>

<p>The c-Jun terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family and regulate signal transduction in response to environmental stress. Activation of JNK3, a neuronal-specific isoform, has been associated with neurological damage, and as such, JNK3 may represent an attractive target for the treatment of neurological disorders. The MAP kinases share between 50% and 80% sequence identity. In order to obtain efficacious and safe compounds, it is necessary to address the issues of potency and selectivity. We report here four crystal structures of JNK3 in complex with three different classes of inhibitors. These structures provide a clear picture of the interactions that each class of compound made with the kinase. Knowledge of the atomic interactions involved in these diverse binding modes provides a platform for structure-guided modification of these compounds, or the de novo design of novel inhibitors that could satisfy the need for potency and selectivity.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the tetrameric glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined to 1.7 A resolution in complex with the sugar substrate. The difference map indicates that 3-phosphoglycerate is bound at the base of a 12 A cleft, positioning C2 of the substrate within 3.5 A of the primary catalytic residue, histidine 8.</p>

<p>Chloramphenicol (Cm), produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae, is an inhibitor of bacterial ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity. The Cm-producing streptomycete modifies the primary (C-3) hydroxyl of the antibiotic by a novel Cm-inactivating enzyme, chloramphenicol 3-O-phosphotransferase (CPT). Here we describe the crystal structures of CPT in the absence and presence of bound substrates. The enzyme is dimeric in a sulfate-free solution and tetramerization is induced by ammonium sulfate, the crystallization precipitant. The tetrameric quaternary structure exhibits crystallographic 222 symmetry and has ATP binding pockets located at a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Steric hindrance allows only one ATP to bind per dimer within the tetramer. In addition to active site binding by Cm, an electron-dense feature resembling the enzyme's product is found at the other subunit interface. The structures of CPT suggest that an aspartate acts as a general base to accept a proton from the 3-hydroxyl of Cm, concurrent with nucleophilic attack of the resulting oxyanion on the gamma-phosphate of ATP. Comparison between liganded and substrate-free CPT structures highlights side chain movements of the active site's Arg136 guanidinium group of &gt;9 A upon substrate binding.</p>

<p>The enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosides involves the formation and subsequent breakdown of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate via oxocarbenium-ion-like transition states. The covalent intermediate may be trapped on-enzyme using 2-fluoro-substituted glycosides, which provide details of the intermediate conformation and noncovalent interactions between enzyme and oligosaccharide. Xylanases are important in industrial applications - in the pulp and paper industry, pretreating wood with xylanases decreases the amount of chlorine-containing chemicals used. Xylanases are structurally similar to cellulases but differ in their specificity for xylose-based, versus glucose-based, substrates.</p>

<p>The three-dimensional structure of the Bacillus stearothermophilus "maltogenic" alpha-amylase, Novamyl, has been determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.7 A. Unlike conventional alpha-amylases from glycoside hydrolase family 13, Novamyl exhibits the five-domain structure more usually associated with cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase. Complexes of the enzyme with both maltose and the inhibitor acarbose have been characterized. In the maltose complex, two molecules of maltose are found in the -1 to -2 and +2 to +3 subsites of the active site, with two more on the C and E domains. The C-domain maltose occupies a position identical to one previously observed in the Bacillus circulans CGTase structure [Lawson, C. L., et al. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 236, 590-600], suggesting that the C-domain plays a genuine biological role in saccharide binding. In the acarbose-maltose complex, the tetrasaccharide inhibitor acarbose is found as an extended hexasaccharide species, bound in the -3 to +3 subsites. The transition state mimicking pseudosaccharide is bound in the -1 subsite of the enzyme in a 2H3 half-chair conformation, as expected. The active site of Novamyl lies in an open gully, fully consistent with its ability to perform internal cleavage via an endo as opposed to an exo activity.</p>

<p>Lopinavir (LPV) is a second-generation HIV protease inhibitor (PI) designed to overcome resistance development in patients undergoing long-term antiviral therapy. The mutation of isoleucine at position 47 of the HIV protease (PR) to alanine is associated with a high level of resistance to LPV. In this study, we show that recombinant PR containing a single I47A substitution has the inhibition constant (K(i) ) value for lopinavir by two orders of magnitude higher than for the wild-type PR. The addition of the I47A substitution to the background of a multiply mutated PR species from an AIDS patient showed a three-order-of-magnitude increase in K(i) in vitro relative to the patient PR without the I47A mutation. The crystal structure of I47A PR in complex with LPV showed the loss of van der Waals interactions in the S2/S2' subsites. This is caused by the loss of three side-chain methyl groups due to the I47A substitution and by structural changes in the A47 main chain that lead to structural changes in the flap antiparallel beta-strand. Furthermore, we analyzed possible interaction of the I47A mutation with secondary mutations V32I and I54V. We show that both mutations in combination with I47A synergistically increase the relative resistance to LPV in vitro. The crystal structure of the I47A/I54V PR double mutant in complex with LPV shows that the I54V mutation leads to a compaction of the flap, and molecular modeling suggests that the introduction of the I54V mutation indirectly affects the strain of the bound inhibitor in the PR binding cleft.</p>

<p>The binding modes of four active site-directed, acylating inhibitors of human alpha-thrombin have been determined using X-ray crystallography. These inhibitors (GR157368, GR166081, GR167088, and GR179849) are representatives of a series utilizing a novel 5, 5-trans-lactone template to specifically acylate Ser195 of thrombin, resulting in an acyl complex. In each case the crystal structure of the complex reveals a binding mode which is consistent with the formation of a covalent bond between the ring-opened lactone of the inhibitor and residue Ser195. Improvements in potency and selectivity of these inhibitors for thrombin are rationalized on the basis of the observed protein/inhibitor interactions identified in these complexes. Occupation of the thrombin S2 and S3 pockets is shown to be directly correlated with improved binding and a degree of selectivity. The binding mode of GR179849 to thrombin is compared with the thrombin/PPACK complex [Bode, W., Turk, D., and Karshikov, A. (1992) Protein Sci. 1, 426-471] as this represents the archetypal binding mode for a thrombin inhibitor. This series of crystal structures is the first to be reported of synthetic, nonpeptidic acylating inhibitors bound to thrombin and provides details of the molecular recognition features that resulted in nanomolar potency.</p>

<p>Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases 1 and 2, also known as cyclooxygenases (COXs) 1 and 2, convert arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandin endoperoxide H(2). Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases are targets of nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2-specific inhibitors called coxibs. PGHS-2 is a sequence homodimer. Each monomer has a peroxidase and a COX active site. We find that human PGHS-2 functions as a conformational heterodimer having a catalytic monomer (E(cat)) and an allosteric monomer (E(allo)). Heme binds tightly only to the peroxidase site of E(cat), whereas substrates, as well as certain inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib), bind the COX site of E(cat). E(cat) is regulated by E(allo) in a manner dependent on what ligand is bound to E(allo). Substrate and nonsubstrate fatty acids (FAs) and some COX inhibitors (e.g. naproxen) preferentially bind to the COX site of E(allo). AA can bind to E(cat) and E(allo), but the affinity of AA for E(allo) is 25 times that for E(cat). Palmitic acid, an efficacious stimulator of human PGHS-2, binds only E(allo) in palmitic acid/murine PGHS-2 co-crystals. Nonsubstrate FAs can potentiate or attenuate actions of COX inhibitors depending on the FA and whether the inhibitor binds E(cat) or E(allo). Our studies suggest that the concentration and composition of the free FA pool in the environment in which PGHS-2 functions in cells, the FA tone, is a key factor regulating PGHS-2 activity and its responses to COX inhibitors. We suggest that differences in FA tone occurring with different diets will likely affect both base-line prostanoid synthesis and responses to COX inhibitors.</p>

<p>The iron-sulfur flavoenzyme adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS) reductase catalyzes a key reaction of the global sulfur cycle by reversibly transforming APS to sulfite and AMP. The structures of the dissimilatory enzyme from Archaeoglobus fulgidus in the reduced state (FAD(red)) and in the sulfite adduct state (FAD-sulfite-AMP) have been recently elucidated at 1.6 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. Here we present new structural features of the enzyme trapped in four different catalytically relevant states that provide us with a detailed picture of its reaction cycle. In the oxidized state (FAD(ox)), the isoalloxazine moiety of the FAD cofactor exhibits a similarly bent conformation as observed in the structure of the reduced enzyme. In the APS-bound state (FAD(ox)-APS), the substrate APS is embedded into a 17 A long substrate channel in such a way that the isoalloxazine ring is pushed toward the channel bottom, thereby producing a compressed enzyme-substrate complex. A clamp formed by residues ArgA317 and LeuA278 to fix the adenine ring and the curved APS conformation appear to be key factors to hold APS in a strained conformation. This energy-rich state is relaxed during the attack of APS on the reduced FAD. A relaxed FAD-sulfite adduct is observed in the structure of the FAD-sulfite state. Finally, a FAD-sulfite-AMP1 state with AMP within van der Waals distance of the sulfite adduct could be characterized. This structure documents how adjacent negative charges are stabilized by the protein matrix which is crucial for forming APS from AMP and sulfite in the reverse reaction.</p>

<p>It was recently established that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase (FBA) and tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate (TBP) aldolase (TBA), two class II aldolases, are highly specific for the diastereoselective synthesis of FBP and TBP from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), respectively. In this paper, we report on a FBA from the thermophile Thermus caldophilus GK24 (Tca) that produces both FBP and TBP from C(3) substrates. Moreover, the FBP:TBP ratio could be adjusted by manipulating the concentrations of G3P and DHAP. This is the first native FBA known to show dual diastereoselectivity among the FBAs and TBAs characterized thus far. To explain the behavior of this enzyme, the X-ray crystal structure of the Tca FBA in complex with DHAP was determined at 2.2A resolution. It appears that as a result of alteration of five G3P binding residues, the substrate binding cavity of Tca FBA has a greater volume than those in the Escherichia coli FBA-phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH) and TBA-PGH complexes. We suggest that this steric difference underlies the difference in the diastereoselectivities of these class II aldolases.</p>

<p>The D-aldohexose dehydrogenase from the thermoacidophilic archaea Thermoplasma acidophilum (AldT) belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily and catalyzes the oxidation of several monosaccharides with a preference for NAD(+) rather than NADP(+) as a cofactor. It has been found that AldT is a unique enzyme that exhibits the highest dehydrogenase activity against D-mannose. Here, we describe the crystal structures of AldT in ligand-free form, in complex with NADH, and in complex with the substrate D-mannose, at 2.1 A, 1.65 A, and 1.6 A resolution, respectively. The AldT subunit forms a typical SDR fold with an unexpectedly long C-terminal tail and assembles into an intertwined tetramer. The D-mannose complex structure reveals that Glu84 interacts with the axial C2 hydroxyl group of the bound D-mannose. Structural comparison with Bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase (BmGlcDH) suggests that the conformation of the glutamate side-chain is crucial for discrimination between D-mannose and its C2 epimer D-glucose, and the conformation of the glutamate side-chain depends on the spatial arrangement of nearby hydrophobic residues that do not directly interact with the substrate. Elucidation of the D-mannose recognition mechanism of AldT further provides structural insights into the unique substrate selectivity of AldT. Finally, we show that the extended C-terminal tail completely shuts the substrate-binding pocket of the neighboring subunit both in the presence and absence of substrate. The elaborate inter-subunit interactions between the C-terminal tail and the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket imply that the tail may play a pivotal role in the enzyme activity.</p>

<p>The induced fit and conformational selection/population shift models are two extreme cases of a continuum aimed at understanding the mechanism by which the final key-lock or active enzyme conformation is achieved upon formation of the correctly ligated enzyme. Structures of complexes representing the Michaelis and enolate intermediate complexes of the reaction catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase provide direct structural evidence for the encounter complex that is intrinsic to the induced fit model and not required by the conformational selection model. In addition, the structural data demonstrate that the conformational selection model is not sufficient to explain the correlation between dynamics and catalysis in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and other enzymes in which the transition between the uninduced and the induced conformations occludes the active site from the solvent. The structural data are consistent with a model in that the energy input from substrate association results in changes in the free energy landscape for the protein, allowing for structural transitions along an induced fit pathway.</p>

<p>Micromolar concentrations of the bile salt deoxycholate are shown to rescue the activity of an inactive mutant, E101A, in the K proton pathway of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase. A crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme reveals, as predicted, deoxycholate bound with its carboxyl group at the entrance of the K path. Since cholate is a known potent inhibitor of bovine oxidase and is seen in a similar position in the bovine structure, the crystallographically defined, conserved steroid binding site could reveal a regulatory site for steroids or structurally related molecules that act on the essential K proton path.</p>

<p>Human H ferritin (HuHF) assembles from 24 four-helix bundles to form an approximately 500 kDa protein with an 8 nm internal cavity. HuHF provides a useful model for studying the transport of metal ions in solution to buried reaction sites in proteins. In this study, HuHF was redesigned to facilitate noble metal ion (Au(3+), Ag(+)) binding, reduction, and nanoparticle formation within the cavity. Computationally determined amino acid substitutions were targeted at four external and four internal surface sites. A variant with a total of 96 cysteines and histidines removed from the exterior surface and 96 non-native cysteines added to the interior surface retained wild-type stability and structure, as confirmed by X-ray crystallography, and promoted the formation of silver or gold nanoparticles within the protein cavity. Crystallographic studies with HuHF variants provide insight into how ferritins control access of metal ions to interior residues that perform chemistry.</p>

<p>Transition state analogue boronic acid inhibitors mimicking the structures and interactions of good penicillin substrates for the TEM-1 beta-lactamase of Escherchia coli were designed using graphic analyses based on the enzyme's 1.7 A crystallographic structure. The synthesis of two of these transition state analogues, (1R)-1-phenylacetamido-2-(3-carboxyphenyl)ethylboronic acid (1) and (1R)-1-acetamido-2-(3-carboxy-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethylboronic acid (2), is reported. Kinetic measurements show that, as designed, compounds 1 and 2 are highly effective deacylation transition state analogue inhibitors of TEM-1 beta-lactamase, with inhibition constants of 5.9 and 13 nM, respectively. These values identify them as among the most potent competitive inhibitors yet reported for a beta-lactamase. The best inhibitor of the current series was (1R)-1-phenylacetamido-2-(3-carboxyphenyl)ethylboronic acid (1, K(I) = 5.9 nM), which resembles most closely the best known substrate of TEM-1, benzylpenicillin (penicillin G). The high-resolution crystallographic structures of these two inhibitors covalently bound to TEM-1 are also described. In addition to verifying the design features, these two structures show interesting and unanticipated changes in the active site area, including strong hydrogen bond formation, water displacement, and rearrangement of side chains. The structures provide new insights into the further design of this potent class of beta-lactamase inhibitors.</p>

<p>GRL-0519 (1) is a potent antiviral inhibitor of HIV-1 protease (PR) possessing tris-tetrahydrofuran (tris-THF) at P2. The high resolution X-ray crystal structures of inhibitor 1 in complexes with single substitution mutants PR(R8Q), PR(D30N), PR(I50V), PR(I54M), and PR(V82A) were analyzed in relation to kinetic data. The smaller valine side chain in PR(I50V) eliminated hydrophobic interactions with inhibitor and the other subunit consistent with 60-fold worse inhibition. Asn30 in PR(D30N) showed altered interactions with neighboring residues and 18-fold worse inhibition. Mutations V82A and I54M showed compensating structural changes consistent with 6-7-fold lower inhibition. Gln8 in PR(R8Q) replaced the ionic interactions of wild type Arg8 with hydrogen bond interactions without changing the inhibition significantly. The carbonyl oxygen of Gly48 showed two alternative conformations in all structures likely due to the snug fit of the large tris-THF group in the S2 subsite in agreement with high antiviral efficacy of 1 on resistant virus.</p>

<p>Biliverdin IXbeta reductase (BVR-B) catalyzes the pyridine nucleotide-dependent production of bilirubin-IXbeta, the major heme catabolite during early fetal development. BVR-B displays a preference for biliverdin isomers without propionates straddling the C10 position, in contrast to biliverdin IXalpha reductase (BVR-A), the major form of BVR in adult human liver. In addition to its tetrapyrrole clearance role in the fetus, BVR-B has flavin and ferric reductase activities in the adult. We have solved the structure of human BVR-B in complex with NADP+ at 1.15 A resolution. Human BVR-B is a monomer displaying an alpha/beta dinucleotide binding fold. The structures of ternary complexes with mesobiliverdin IValpha, biliverdin IXalpha, FMN and lumichrome show that human BVR-B has a single substrate binding site, to which substrates and inhibitors bind primarily through hydrophobic interactions, explaining its broad specificity. The reducible atom of both biliverdin and flavin substrates lies above the reactive C4 of the cofactor, an appropriate position for direct hydride transfer. BVR-B discriminates against the biliverdin IXalpha isomer through steric hindrance at the bilatriene side chain binding pockets. The structure also explains the enzyme's preference for NADP(H) and its B-face stereospecificity.</p>

<p>The leucine biosynthetic enzyme 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IMDH) belongs to a unique class of bifunctional decarboxylating dehydrogenases. The two best-known members of this family, IMDH and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), share a common structural framework and catalytic mechanism but have different substrate and cofactor specificities. IMDH is NAD(+)-dependent, while IDHs occur in both NAD(+)-dependent and NADP(+)-dependent forms.</p>

<p>GRL-0519 (1) is a potent antiviral inhibitor of HIV-1 protease (PR) possessing tris-tetrahydrofuran (tris-THF) at P2. The high resolution X-ray crystal structures of inhibitor 1 in complexes with single substitution mutants PR(R8Q), PR(D30N), PR(I50V), PR(I54M), and PR(V82A) were analyzed in relation to kinetic data.

<p>An understanding of the physiological and toxicological properties of borate and the utilization of boronic acids in drug development require a basic understanding of borate-enzyme chemistry. We report here the extension of our recent NMR studies indicating the formation of a ternary borate-alcohol-trypsin complex. Crystallographic and solution state NMR studies of porcine trypsin were performed in the presence of borate and either of three alcohols designed to bind to the S1 affinity subsite: 4-aminobutanol, guanidine-3-propanol, and 4-hydroxymethylbenzamidine. Quaternary complexes of trypsin, borate, S1-binding alcohol, and ethylene glycol (a cryoprotectant), as well as a ternary trypsin, borate, and ethylene glycol complex have been observed in the crystalline state. Borate forms ester bonds to Ser195, ethylene glycol (two bonds), and the S1-binding alcohol (if present). Spectra from (1)H and (11)B NMR studies confirm that these complexes also exist in solution and also provide evidence for the formation of ternary trypsin, borate, and S1-subsite alcohol complexes which are not observed in the crystals using our experimental protocols. Analysis of eight crystal structures indicates that formation of an active site borate complex is in all cases accompanied by a significant (approximately 4%) increase in the b-axis dimension of the unit cell. Presumably, our inability to observe the ternary complexes in the crystalline state arises from the lower stability of these complexes and consequent inability to overcome the constraints imposed by the lattice contacts. A mechanism for the coupling of the lattice contacts with the active site that involves a conformational rearrangement of Gln192 is suggested. The structures presented here represent the first crystallographic demonstration of covalent binding of an enzyme by borate.</p>

<p>Clinical inhibitor amprenavir (APV) is less effective on HIV-2 protease (PR₂) than on HIV-1 protease (PR₁). We solved the crystal structure of PR₂ with APV at 1.5 Å resolution to identify structural changes associated with the lowered inhibition. Furthermore, we analyzed the PR₁ mutant (PR(1M) ) with substitutions V32I, I47V, and V82I that mimic the inhibitor binding site of PR₂. PR(1M) more closely resembled PR₂ than PR₁ in catalytic efficiency on four substrate peptides and inhibition by APV, whereas few differences were seen for two other substrates and inhibition by saquinavir (SQV) and darunavir (DRV). High resolution crystal structures of PR(1M) with APV, DRV, and SQV were compared with available PR₁ and PR₂ complexes. Val/Ile32 and Ile/Val47 showed compensating interactions with SQV in PR(1M) and PR₁, however, Ile82 interacted with a second SQV bound in an extension of the active site cavity of PR(1M). Residues 32 and 82 maintained similar interactions with DRV and APV in all the enzymes, whereas Val47 and Ile47 had opposing effects in the two subunits. Significantly diminished interactions were seen for the aniline of APV bound in PR₁ (M) and PR₂ relative to the strong hydrogen bonds observed in PR₁, consistent with 15- and 19-fold weaker inhibition, respectively. Overall, PR(1M) partially replicates the specificity of PR₂ and gives insight into drug resistant mutations at residues 32, 47, and 82. Moreover, this analysis provides a structural explanation for the weaker antiviral effects of APV on HIV-2.</p>

<p>Cholera toxin (CT) is a heterohexameric bacterial protein toxin belonging to a larger family of A/B ADP-ribosylating toxins. Each of these toxins undergoes limited proteolysis and/or disulfide bond reduction to form the enzymatically active toxic fragment. Nicking and reduction render both CT and the closely related heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli (LT) unstable in solution, thus far preventing a full structural understanding of the conformational changes resulting from toxin activation. We present the first structural glimpse of an active CT in structures from three crystal forms of a single-site A-subunit CT variant, Y30S, which requires no activational modifications for full activity. We also redetermined the structure of the wild-type, proenzyme CT from two crystal forms, both of which exhibit (i) better geometry and (ii) a different A2 "tail" conformation than the previously determined structure [Zhang et al. (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 251, 563-573]. Differences between wild-type CT and active CTY30S are observed in A-subunit loop regions that had been previously implicated in activation by analysis of the structure of an LT A-subunit R7K variant [van den Akker et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 10996-11004]. The 25-36 activation loop is disordered in CTY30S, while the 47-56 active site loop displays varying degrees of order in the three CTY30S structures, suggesting that disorder in the activation loop predisposes the active site loop to a greater degree of flexibility than that found in unactivated wild-type CT. On the basis of these six new views of the CT holotoxin, we propose a model for how the activational modifications experienced by wild-type CT are communicated to the active site.</p>

<p>We investigated a series of sulfonamide boronic acids that resulted from the merging of two unrelated AmpC β-lactamase inhibitor series. The new boronic acids differed in the replacement of the canonical carboxamide, found in all penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics, with a sulfonamide. Surprisingly, these sulfonamides had a highly distinct structure-activity relationship from the previously explored carboxamides, high ligand efficiencies (up to 0.91), and K(i) values down to 25 nM and up to 23 times better for smaller analogues. Conversely, K(i) values were 10-20 times worse for larger molecules than in the carboxamide congener series. X-ray crystal structures (1.6-1.8 Å) of AmpC with three of the new sulfonamides suggest that this altered structure-activity relationship results from the different geometry and polarity of the sulfonamide versus the carboxamide. The most potent inhibitor reversed β-lactamase-mediated resistance to third generation cephalosporins, lowering their minimum inhibitory concentrations up to 32-fold in cell culture.</p>

<p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has a critical role in cardiovascular function by cleaving the carboxy terminal His-Leu dipeptide from angiotensin I to produce a potent vasopressor octapeptide, angiotensin II. Inhibitors of ACE are a first line of therapy for hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy. Notably, these inhibitors were developed without knowledge of the structure of human ACE, but were instead designed on the basis of an assumed mechanistic homology with carboxypeptidase A. Here we present the X-ray structure of human testicular ACE and its complex with one of the most widely used inhibitors, lisinopril (N2-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-lysyl-L-proline; also known as Prinivil or Zestril), at 2.0 A resolution. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of ACE shows that it bears little similarity to that of carboxypeptidase A, but instead resembles neurolysin and Pyrococcus furiosus carboxypeptidase--zinc metallopeptidases with no detectable sequence similarity to ACE. The structure provides an opportunity to design domain-selective ACE inhibitors that may exhibit new pharmacological profiles.</p>

<p>Glycosylasparaginase uses an autoproteolytic processing mechanism, through an N-O acyl shift, to generate a mature/active enzyme from a single-chain precursor. Structures of glycosylasparaginase precursors in complex with a glycine inhibitor have revealed the backbone in the immediate vicinity of the scissile peptide bond to be in a distorted trans conformation, which is believed to be the driving force for the N-O acyl shift to break the peptide bond. Here we report the effects of point mutation D151N. In addition to the loss of the base essential in autoproteolysis, this mutation also eradicates the backbone distortion near the scissile peptide bond. Binding of the glycine inhibitor to the autoproteolytic site of the D151N mutant does not restore the backbone distortion. Therefore, Asp151 plays a dual role, acting as the general base to activate the nucleophile and holding the distorted trans conformation that is critical for initiating an N-O acyl shift.</p>

<p>Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.</p>

<p>Positive-strand RNA viruses include a large number of human and animal pathogens whose essential RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) share a structurally homologous core with an encircled active site. RdRPs are targets for antiviral drug development, but these efforts are hindered by limited structural information about the RdRP catalytic cycle. To further our understanding of RdRP function, we assembled, purified, and then crystallized poliovirus elongation complexes after multiple rounds of nucleotide incorporation. Here we present structures capturing the active polymerase and its nucleotide triphosphate complexes in four distinct states, leading us to propose a six-state catalytic cycle involving residues that are highly conserved among positive-strand RNA virus RdRPs. The structures indicate that RdRPs use a fully prepositioned templating base for nucleotide recognition and close their active sites for catalysis using a novel structural rearrangement in the palm domain. The data also suggest that translocation by RDRPs may not be directly linked to the conformational changes responsible for active site closure and reopening.</p>

<p>Peptidoglycan (PGN) consists of repeating units of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), which are cross-linked by short peptides. It is well known that PGN forms a major cell wall component of bacteria making it an important ligand for the recognition by peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) of the host. The binding studies showed that PGN, GlcNAc, and MurNAc bind to camel PGRP-S (CPGRP-S) with affinities corresponding to dissociation constants of 1.3 × 10(-9), 2.6 × 10(-7), and 1.8 × 10(-7) M, respectively. The crystal structure determinations of the complexes of CPGRP-S with GlcNAc and MurNAc showed that the structures consist of four crystallographically independent molecules, A, B, C, and D, in the asymmetric unit that exists as A-B and C-D units of two neighboring linear polymers. The structure determinations showed that compounds GlcNAc and MurNAc bound to CPGRP-S at the same subsite in molecule C. Both GlcNAc and MurNAc form several hydrogen bonds and extensive hydrophobic interactions with protein atoms, indicating the specific nature of their bindings. Flow cytometric studies showed that PGN enhanced the secretions of TNF-α and IL-6 from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The introduction of CPGRP-S to the PGN-challenged cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells reduced the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. This showed that CPGRP-S inhibited PGN-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and down-regulated macrophage-mediated inflammation, indicating its potential applications as an antibacterial agent.</p>

<p>The x-ray crystal structures of five triclosan analogs, in addition to that of the isoniazid-NAD adduct, are described in relation to their integral role in the design of potent inhibitors of the malarial enzyme Plasmodium falciparum enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (PfENR). Many of the novel 5-substituted analogs exhibit low micromolar potency against in vitro cultures of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains of the P. falciparum parasite and inhibit purified PfENR enzyme with IC50 values of &lt;200 nM. This study has significantly expanded the knowledge base with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triclosan while affording gains against cultured parasites and purified PfENR enzyme. In contrast to a recent report in the literature, these results demonstrate the ability to improve the in vitro potency of triclosan significantly by replacing the suboptimal 5-chloro group with larger hydrophobic moieties. The biological and x-ray crystallographic data thus demonstrate the flexibility of the active site and point to future rounds of optimization to improve compound potency against purified enzyme and intracellular Plasmodium parasites.</p>

<p>As part of a program to discover improved glycoside hydrolase family 12 (GH 12) endoglucanases, we have extended our previous work on the structural and biochemical diversity of GH 12 homologs to include the most stable fungal GH 12 found, Humicola grisea Cel12A. The H. grisea enzyme was much more stable to irreversible thermal denaturation than the Trichoderma reesei enzyme. It had an apparent denaturation midpoint (T(m)) of 68.7 degrees C, 14.3 degrees C higher than the T. reesei enzyme. There are an additional three cysteines found in the H. grisea Cel12A enzyme. To determine their importance for thermal stability, we constructed three H. grisea Cel12A single mutants in which these cysteines were exchanged with the corresponding residues in the T. reesei enzyme. We also introduced these cysteine residues into the T. reesei enzyme. The thermal stability of these variants was determined. Substitutions at any of the three positions affected stability, with the largest effect seen in H. grisea C206P, which has a T(m) 9.1 degrees C lower than that of the wild type. The T. reesei cysteine variant that gave the largest increase in stability, with a T(m) 3.9 degrees C higher than wild type, was the P201C mutation, the converse of the destabilizing C206P mutation in H. grisea. To help rationalize the results, we have determined the crystal structure of the H. grisea enzyme and of the most stable T. reesei cysteine variant, P201C. The three cysteines in H. grisea Cel12A play an important role in the thermal stability of this protein, although they are not involved in a disulfide bond.</p>

<p>SHMT (serine hydoxymethyltransferase), a type I pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme, catalyses the conversion of L-serine and THF (tetrahydrofolate) into glycine and 5,10-methylene THF. SHMT also catalyses several THF-independent side reactions such as cleavage of beta-hydroxy amino acids, transamination, racemization and decarboxylation. In the present study, the residues Asn(341), Tyr(60) and Phe(351), which are likely to influence THF binding, were mutated to alanine, alanine and glycine respectively, to elucidate the role of these residues in THF-dependent and -independent reactions catalysed by SHMT. The N341A and Y60A bsSHMT (Bacillus stearothermophilus SHMT) mutants were inactive for the THF-dependent activity, while the mutations had no effect on THF-independent activity. However, mutation of Phe(351) to glycine did not have any effect on either of the activities. The crystal structures of the glycine binary complexes of the mutants showed that N341A bsSHMT forms an external aldimine as in bsSHMT, whereas Y60A and F351G bsSHMTs exist as a mixture of internal/external aldimine and gem-diamine forms. Crystal structures of all of the three mutants obtained in the presence of L-allo-threonine were similar to the respective glycine binary complexes. The structure of the ternary complex of F351G bsSHMT with glycine and FTHF (5-formyl THF) showed that the monoglutamate side chain of FTHF is ordered in both the subunits of the asymmetric unit, unlike in the wild-type bsSHMT. The present studies demonstrate that the residues Asn(341) and Tyr(60) are pivotal for the binding of THF/FTHF, whereas Phe(351) is responsible for the asymmetric binding of FTHF in the two subunits of the dimer.</p>

In the present study, the residues Asn(341), Tyr(60) and Phe(351), which are likely to influence THF binding, were mutated to alanine, alanine and glycine respectively, to elucidate the role of these residues in THF-dependent and -independent reactions catalysed by SHMT. The N341A and Y60A bsSHMT (Bacillus stearothermophilus SHMT) mutants were inactive for the THF-dependent activity, while the mutations had no effect on THF-independent activity. However, mutation of Phe(351) to glycine did not have any effect on either of the activities. The crystal structures of the glycine binary complexes of the mutants showed that N341A bsSHMT forms an external aldimine as in bsSHMT, whereas Y60A and F351G bsSHMTs exist as a mixture of internal/external aldimine and gem-diamine forms. Crystal structures of all of the three mutants obtained in the presence of L-allo-threonine were similar to the respective glycine binary complexes. The structure of the ternary complex of F351G bsSHMT with glycine and FTHF (5-formyl THF) showed that the monoglutamate side chain of FTHF is ordered in both the subunits of the asymmetric unit, unlike in the wild-type bsSHMT. The present studies demonstrate that the residues Asn(341) and Tyr(60) are pivotal for the binding of THF/FTHF, whereas Phe(351) is responsible for the asymmetric binding of FTHF in the two subunits of the dimer.</p>

<p>Two boron-containing, ortho-icosahedral carborane lipophilic antifolates were synthesized, and the crystal structures of their ternary complexes with human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate were determined. The compounds were screened for activity against DHFR from six sources (human, rat liver, Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycobacterium avium, and Lactobacillus casei) and showed good to modest activity against these enzymes. The compounds were also tested for antibacterial activity against L. casei, M. tuberculosis H37Ra, and three M. avium strains and for cytotoxic activity against seven different human tumor cell lines. Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity was modest, with one sample, the closo-carborane 4, showing about 10-fold greater activity. The less toxic nido-carborane 2 was also tested as a candidate for boron neutron capture therapy, but showed poor tumor retention and low selectivity ratios for boron distribution in tumor tissue versus normal tissue.</p>

<p>Many serine proteases are targets for therapeutic intervention because they often play key roles in disease. Small molecule inhibitors of serine proteases with high affinity are especially interesting as they could be used as scaffolds from which to develop drugs selective for protease targets. One such inhibitor is bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane (BABIM), standing out as the best inhibitor of trypsin (by a factor of over 100) in a series of over 60 relatively closely related analogues. By probing the structural basis of inhibition, we discovered, using crystallographic methods, a new mode of high-affinity binding in which a Zn2+ ion is tetrahedrally coordinated between two chelating nitrogens of BABIM and two active site residues, His57 and Ser 195. Zn2+, at subphysiological levels, enhances inhibition by over 10(3)-fold. The distinct Zn2+ coordination geometry implies a strong dependence of affinity on substituents. This unique structural paradigm has enabled development of potent, highly selective, Zn2+-dependent inhibitors of several therapeutically important serine proteases, using a physiologically ubiquitous metal ion.</p>

<p>Trypanothione replaces glutathione in defence against cellular damage caused by oxidants, xenobiotics and methylglyoxal in the trypanosomatid parasites, which cause trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. In Leishmania major, the first step in methylglyoxal detoxification is performed by a trypanothione-dependent glyoxalase I (GLO1) containing a nickel cofactor; all other characterized eukaryotic glyoxalases use zinc. In kinetic studies L. major and human enzymes were active with methylglyoxal derivatives of several thiols, but showed opposite substrate selectivities: N1-glutathionylspermidine hemithioacetal is 40-fold better with L. major GLO1, whereas glutathione hemithioacetal is 300-fold better with human GLO1. Similarly, S-4-bromobenzylglutathionylspermidine is a 24-fold more potent linear competitive inhibitor of L. major than human GLO1 (Kis of 0.54 microM and 12.6 microM, respectively), whereas S-4-bromobenzylglutathione is &gt;4000-fold more active against human than L. major GLO1 (Kis of 0.13 microM and &gt;500 microM respectively). The crystal structure of L. major GLO1 reveals differences in active site architecture to both human GLO1 and the nickel-dependent Escherichia coli GLO1, including increased negative charge and hydrophobic character and truncation of a loop that may regulate catalysis in the human enzyme. These differences correlate with the differential binding of glutathione and trypanothione-based substrates, and thus offer a route to the rational design of L. major-specific GLO1 inhibitors.</p>

<p>Fucose metabolism pathways are present in many bacterial species and typically contain the central fucose-processing enzymes fucose isomerase (FcsI), fuculose kinase (FcsK), and fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FcsA). Fucose initially undergoes isomerization by FcsI producing fuculose, which is then phosphorylated by FcsK. FcsA cleaves the fuculose-1-phosphate product into lactaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which can be incorporated into central metabolism allowing the bacterium to use fucose as an energy source. Streptococcus pneumoniae has fucose-processing operons containing homologs of FcsI, FcsK, and FcsA; however, this bacterium appears unable to utilize fucose as an energy source. To investigate this contradiction, we performed biochemical and structural studies of the S. pneumoniae fucose-processing enzymes SpFcsI, SpFcsK, and SpFcsA. These enzymes are demonstrated to act in a sequential manner to ultimately produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate and have structural features entirely consistent with their observed biochemical activities. Analogous to the regulation of the Escherichia coli fucose utilization operon, fuculose-1-phosphate appears to act as an inducing molecule for activation of the S. pneumoniae fucose operon. Despite our evidence that S. pneumoniae appears to have the appropriate regulatory and biochemical machinery for fucose metabolism, we confirmed the inability of the S. pneumoniae TIGR4 strain to grow on fucose or on the H-disaccharide, which is the probable substrate of the transporter for the pathway. On the basis of these observations, we postulate that the S. pneumoniae fucose-processing pathway has a non-metabolic role in the interaction of this bacterium with its human host.</p>

<p>Enolase is a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of 2-phospho-D-glycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate. This reversible dehydration is effected by general acid-base catalysis that involves, principally, Lys345 and Glu211 (numbering system of enolase 1 from yeast). The crystal structure of the inactive E211Q enolase shows that the protein is properly folded. However, K345 variants have, thus far, failed to crystallize. This problem was solved by crystallization of an engineered heterodimer of enolase. The heterodimer was composed of an inactive subunit that has a K345A mutation and an active subunit that has N80D and N126D surface mutations to facilitate ion-exchange chromatographic separation of the three dimeric species. The structure of this heterodimeric variant, in complex with substrate/product, was obtained at 1.85 A resolution. The structure was compared to a new structure of wild-type enolase obtained from crystals belonging to the same space group. Asymmetric dimers having one subunit exhibiting two of the three active site loops in an open conformation and the other in a conformation having all three loops closed appear in both structures. The K345A subunit of the heterodimer is in the loop-closed conformation; its Calpha carbon atoms closely match those of the corresponding subunit of wild-type enolase (root-mean-squared deviation of 0.23 A). The kcat and kcat/Km values of the heterodimer are approximately half those of the N80D/N126D homodimer, which suggests that the subunits in solution are kinetically independent. A comparison of enolase structures obtained from crystals belonging to different space groups suggests that asymmetric dimers can be a consequence of the asymmetric positioning of the subunits within the crystal lattice.</p>

<p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections constitute a serious health threat worldwide, and novel antibiotics are therefore urgently needed. The enoyl-ACP reductase (saFabI) is essential for the S. aureus fatty acid biosynthesis and, hence, serves as an attractive drug target. We have obtained a series of snapshots of this enzyme that provide a mechanistic picture of ligand and inhibitor binding, including a dimer-tetramer transition combined with extensive conformational changes. Significantly, our results reveal key differences in ligand binding and recognition compared to orthologous proteins. The remarkable observed protein flexibility rationalizes our finding that saFabI is capable of efficiently reducing branched-chain fatty acid precursors. Importantly, branched-chain fatty acids represent a major fraction of the S. aureus cell membrane and are crucial for its in vivo fitness. Our discovery thus addresses a long-standing controversy regarding the essentiality of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in S. aureus rationalizing saFabI as a drug target.</p>

<p>The cytidine deaminase substrate analog inhibitor 3-deazacytidine binds with its 4-amino group inserted into a site previously identified as a probable binding site for the leaving ammonia group. Binding to this site shifts the pyrimidine ring significantly further from the activated water molecule than the position it occupies in either of two complexes with compounds capable of hydrogen bonding at the 3-position of the ring [Xiang et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 4516-4523]. Difference Fourier maps between the deazacytidine, dihydrozebularine, and zebularine--hydrate inhibitor complexes suggest that the ring itself moves successively toward the activated water, leaving the amino group behind in this site as the substrate complex approaches the transition state. They also reveal systematic changes in a single zinc-sulfur bond distance. These correlate with chemical changes expected as the substrate approaches the tetrahedral transition state, in which the zinc-activated hydroxyl group develops maximal negative charge and forms a short hydrogen bond to the neighboring carboxylate group of Glu 104. Empirical bond valence relationships suggest that the Zn-S gamma 132 bond functions throughout the reaction as a "valence buffer" that accommodates changing negative charge on the hydroxyl group. Similar structural features in alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that analogous mechanisms may be a general feature of catalysis by zinc enzymes.</p>

<p>Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, utilizing NADH as a cofactor. It has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in the area of cancer metabolism. In this manuscript we report our progress using fragment-based lead generation (FBLG), assisted by X-ray crystallography to develop small molecule LDHA inhibitors. Fragment hits were identified through NMR and SPR screening and optimized into lead compounds with nanomolar binding affinities via fragment linking. Also reported is their modification into cellular active compounds suitable for target validation work.</p>

<p>Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe type of malaria, a life-threatening disease affecting the lives of over three billion people. Factors like widespread resistance against available drugs and absence of an effective vaccine are seriously compounding control of the malaria parasite. Thus, there is an urgent need for the identification and validation of new drug targets. The enzymes of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway have been suggested as possible targets for the treatment of malaria. One of these enzymes is spermidine synthase (SPDS, putrescine aminopropyltransferase), which catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl moiety from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) to putrescine, leading to the formation of spermidine and 5'-methylthioadenosine. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of P. falciparum spermidine synthase (pfSPDS) in apo form, in complex with dcAdoMet and two inhibitors, S-adenosyl-1,8-diamino-3-thio-octane (AdoDATO) and trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (4MCHA). The results show that binding of dcAdoMet to pfSPDS stabilizes the conformation of the flexible gatekeeper loop of the enzyme and affects the conformation of the active-site amino acid residues, preparing the protein for binding of the second substrate. The complexes of AdoDATO and 4MCHA with pfSPDS reveal the mode of interactions of these compounds with the enzyme. While AdoDATO essentially fills the entire active-site pocket, 4MCHA only occupies part of it, which suggests that simple modifications of this compound may yield more potent inhibitors of pfSPDS.</p>

<p>Rice Os4BGlu12, a glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) β-glucosidase, hydrolyzes β-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3-6 glucosyl residues and the β-(1,3)-linked disaccharide laminaribiose, as well as certain glycosides. The crystal structures of apo Os4BGlu12, and its complexes with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxyl-2-fluoroglucoside (DNP2FG) and 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose (G2F) were solved at 2.50, 2.45 and 2.40Å resolution, respectively. The overall structure of rice Os4BGlu12 is typical of GH1 enzymes, but it contains an extra disulfide bridge in the loop B region. The glucose ring of the G2F in the covalent intermediate was found in a (4)C(1) chair conformation, while that of the noncovalently bound DNP2FG had a (1)S(3) skew boat, consistent with hydrolysis via a (4)H(3) half-chair transition state. The position of the catalytic nucleophile (Glu393) in the G2F structure was more similar to that of the Sinapsis alba myrosinase G2F complex than to that in covalent intermediates of other O-glucosidases, such as rice Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7 β-glucosidases. This correlated with a significant thioglucosidase activity for Os4BGlu12, although with 200- to 1200-fold lower k(cat)/K(m) values for S-glucosides than the comparable O-glucosides, while hydrolysis of S-glucosides was undetectable for Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7.</p>

<p>LpxC is an essential enzyme in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway in gram-negative bacteria. Several promising antimicrobial lead compounds targeting LpxC have been reported, though they typically display a large variation in potency against different gram-negative pathogens. We report that inhibitors with a diacetylene scaffold effectively overcome the resistance caused by sequence variation in the LpxC substrate-binding passage. Compound binding is captured in complex with representative LpxC orthologs, and structural analysis reveals large conformational differences that mostly reflect inherent molecular features of distinct LpxC orthologs, whereas ligand-induced structural adaptations occur at a smaller scale. These observations highlight the need for a molecular understanding of inherent structural features and conformational plasticity of LpxC enzymes for optimizing LpxC inhibitors as broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative infections.</p>

<p>Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.</p>

<p>The cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which provide a barrier against the entry of many antibiotics. LPS assembly involves a multiprotein LPS transport (Lpt) complex that spans from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane. In this complex, an unusual ATP-binding cassette transporter is thought to power the extraction of LPS from the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane and its transport across the cell envelope. We introduce changes into the nucleotide-binding domain, LptB, that inactivate transporter function in vivo. We characterize these residues using biochemical experiments combined with high-resolution crystal structures of LptB pre- and post-ATP hydrolysis and suggest a role for an active site residue in phosphate exit. We also identify a conserved residue that is not required for ATPase activity but is essential for interaction with the transmembrane components. Our studies establish the essentiality of ATP hydrolysis by LptB to power LPS transport in cells and suggest strategies to inhibit transporter function away from the LptB active site. </p>

<p>Quinolinate synthase (NadA) is a Fe4S4 cluster-containing dehydrating enzyme involved in the synthesis of quinolinic acid (QA), the universal precursor of the essential nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) coenzyme. A previously determined apo NadA crystal structure revealed the binding of one substrate analog, providing partial mechanistic information. Here, we report on the holo X-ray structure of NadA. The presence of the Fe4S4 cluster generates an internal tunnel and a cavity in which we have docked the last precursor to be dehydrated to form QA. We find that the only suitably placed residue to initiate this process is the conserved Tyr21. Furthermore, Tyr21 is close to a conserved Thr-His-Glu triad reminiscent of those found in proteases and other hydrolases. Our mutagenesis data show that all of these residues are essential for activity and strongly suggest that Tyr21 deprotonation, to form the reactive nucleophilic phenoxide anion, is mediated by the triad. NadA displays a dehydration mechanism significantly different from the one found in archetypical dehydratases such as aconitase, which use a serine residue deprotonated by an oxyanion hole. The X-ray structure of NadA will help us unveil its catalytic mechanism, the last step in the understanding of NAD biosynthesis. </p>

<p>We report the design, synthesis, biological evaluation, and the X-ray crystal structure of a novel inhibitor bound to the HIV-1 protease. Various C3-functionalized cyclopentanyltetrahydrofurans (Cp-THF) were designed to interact with the flap Gly48 carbonyl or amide NH in the S2-subsite of the HIV-1 protease. We investigated the potential of those functionalized ligands in combination with hydroxyethylsulfonamide isosteres. Inhibitor 26 containing a 3-(R)-hydroxyl group on the Cp-THF core displayed the most potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activity. Our studies revealed a preference for the 3-(R)-configuration over the corresponding 3-(S)-derivative. Inhibitor 26 exhibited potent activity against a panel of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants. A high resolution X-ray structure of 26-bound HIV-1 protease revealed important molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions.</p>

<p>Two monofunctional Delta(3), Delta(2)-enoyl-CoA isomerases, one in mitochondria (mECI) and the other in both mitochondria and peroxisomes (pECI), belong to the low-similarity isomerase/hydratase superfamily. Both enzymes catalyze the movement of a double bond from C3 to C2 of an unsaturated acyl-CoA substrate for re-entry into the beta-oxidation pathway. Mutagenesis has shown that Glu165 of rat mECI is involved in catalysis; however, the putative catalytic residue in yeast pECI, Glu158, is not conserved in mECI. To elucidate whether Glu165 of mECI is correctly positioned for catalysis, the crystal structure of rat mECI has been solved. Crystal packing suggests the enzyme is trimeric, in contrast to other members of the superfamily, which appear crystallographically to be dimers of trimers. The polypeptide fold of mECI, like pECI, belongs to a subset of this superfamily in which the C-terminal domain of a given monomer interacts with its own N-terminal domain. This differs from that of crotonase and 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphtoyl-CoA synthase, whose C-terminal domains are involved in domain swapping with an adjacent monomer. The structure confirms Glu165 as the putative catalytic acid/base, positioned to abstract the pro-R proton from C2 and reprotonate at C4 of the acyl chain. The large tunnel-shaped active site cavity observed in the mECI structure explains the relative substrate promiscuity in acyl-chain length and stereochemistry. Comparison with the crystal structure of pECI suggests the catalytic residues from both enzymes are spatially conserved but not in their primary structures, providing a powerful reminder of how catalytic residues cannot be determined solely by sequence alignments.</p>

<p>We demonstrated recently that two protons are involved in reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide through a proton-coupled electron transfer (ET) reaction catalyzed by the blue Cu-dependent nitrite reductase (Cu NiR) of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (AxNiR). Here, the functionality of two putative proton channels, one involving Asn90 and the other His254, is studied using single (N90S, H254F) and double (N90S--H254F) mutants. All mutants studied are active, indicating that protons are still able to reach the active site. The H254F mutation has no effect on the catalytic activity, while the N90S mutation results in ~70% decrease in activity. Laser flash-photolysis experiments show that in H254F and wild-type enzyme electrons enter at the level of the T1Cu and then redistribute between the two Cu sites. Complete ET from T1Cu to T2Cu occurs only when nitrite binds at the T2Cu site. This indicates that substrate binding to T2Cu promotes ET from T1Cu, suggesting that the enzyme operates an ordered mechanism. In fact, in the N90S and N90S--H254F variants, where the T1Cu site redox potential is elevated by ∼60 mV, inter-Cu ET is only observed in the presence of nitrite. From these results it is evident that the Asn90 channel is the main proton channel in AxNiR, though protons can still reach the active site if this channel is disrupted. Crystallographic structures provide a clear structural rationale for these observations, including restoration of the proton delivery via a significant movement of the loop connecting the T1Cu ligands Cys130 and His139 that occurs on binding of nitrite. Notably, a role for this loop in facilitating interaction of cytochrome c(551) with Cu NiR has been suggested previously based on a crystal structure of the binary complex.</p>

<p>3-Hydroxybenzoate 6-hydroxylase (3HB6H) from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 is a dimeric flavoprotein that catalyzes the NADH- and oxygen-dependent para-hydroxylation of 3-hydroxybenzoate to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate. In this study, we report the crystal structure of 3HB6H as expressed in Escherichia coli. The overall fold of 3HB6H is similar to that of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and other flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylases. Unexpectedly, a lipid ligand is bound to each 3HB6H monomer. Mass spectral analysis identified the ligand as a mixture of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The fatty acid chains occupy hydrophobic channels that deeply penetrate into the interior of the substrate-binding domain of each subunit, whereas the hydrophilic part is exposed on the protein surface, connecting the dimerization domains via a few interactions. Most remarkably, the terminal part of a phospholipid acyl chain is directly involved in the substrate-binding site. Co-crystallized chloride ion and the crystal structure of the H213S variant with bound 3-hydroxybenzoate provide hints about oxygen activation and substrate hydroxylation. Essential roles are played by His-213 in catalysis and Tyr-105 in substrate binding. This phospholipid-assisted strategy to control regioselective aromatic hydroxylation is of relevance for optimization of flavin-dependent biocatalysts. </p>

<p>CTX-M enzymes are an emerging group of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) that hydrolyze not only the penicillins but also the first-, second-, and third-generation cephalosporins. Although they have become the most frequently observed ESBLs in certain areas, there are few effective inhibitors and relatively little is known about their detailed mechanism. Here we describe the X-ray crystal structures of CTX-M enzymes in complex with different transition-state analogues and beta-lactam inhibitors, representing the enzyme as it progresses from its acylation transition state to its acyl enzyme complex to the deacylation transition state. As the enzyme moves along this reaction coordinate, two key catalytic residues, Lys73 and Glu166, change conformations, tracking the state of the reaction. Unexpectedly, the acyl enzyme complex with the beta-lactam inhibitor cefoxitin still has the catalytic water bound; this water had been predicted to be displaced by the unusual 7alpha-methoxy of the inhibitor. Instead, the 7alpha-group appears to inhibit by preventing the formation of the deacylation transition state through steric hindrance. From an inhibitor design standpoint, we note that the best of the reversible inhibitors, a ceftazidime-like boronic acid compound, binds to CTX-M-16 with a K(i) value of 4 nM. When used together in cell culture, this inhibitor reversed cefotaxime resistance in CTX-M-producing bacteria. The structure of its complex with CTX-M enzyme and the structural view of the reaction coordinate described here provide templates for inhibitor design and intervention to combat this family of antibiotic resistance enzymes.</p>

<p>Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) confer bacterial resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime, increasing hospital mortality rates. Whereas these antibiotics are almost impervious to classic beta-lactamases, such as TEM-1, ESBLs have one to four orders greater activity against them. The origins of this activity have been widely studied for the TEM and SHV-type ESBLs, but have received less attention for the CTX-M beta-lactamases, an emerging family that is now the dominant ESBL in several regions. To understand how CTX-M beta-lactamases achieve their remarkable activity, biophysical and structural studies were undertaken. Using reversible, two-state thermal denaturation, it was found that as these enzymes evolve a broader substrate range, they sacrifice stability. Thus, the mutant enzyme CTX-M-16 is eightfold more active against ceftazidime than the pseudo-wild-type CTX-M-14 but is 1.9 kcal/mol less stable. This is consistent with a "stability-activity tradeoff," similar to that observed in the evolution of other resistance enzymes. To investigate the structural basis of enzyme activity and stability, the structures of four CTX-M enzymes were determined by X-ray crystallography. The structures of CTX-M-14, CTX-M-27, CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-16 were determined to 1.10 Angstroms, 1.20 Angstroms, 0.98 Angstroms and 1.74 Angstroms resolution, respectively. The enzyme active sites resemble those of the narrow-spectrum TEM-1 and SHV-1, and not the enlarged sites typical of ESBL mutants such as TEM-52 and TEM-64. Instead, point substitutions leading to specific interactions may be responsible for the improved activity against ceftazidime and cefotaxime, consistent with observations first made for the related Toho-1 enzyme. The broadened substrate range of CTX-M-16 may result from coupled defects in the enzyme's B3 strand, which lines the active site. Substitutions Val231--&gt;Ala and Asp240--&gt;Gly, which convert CTX-M-14 into CTX-M-16, occur at either end of this strand. These defects appear to increase the mobility of B3 based on anisotropic B-factor analyses at ultrahigh resolution, consistent with stability loss and activity gain. The unusually high resolution of these structures that makes such analyses possible also makes them good templates for inhibitor discovery.</p>

<p>Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases catalyze the oxidation of carbonylic substrates to ester or lactone products using NADPH as electron donor and molecular oxygen as oxidative reactant. Using protein engineering, kinetics, microspectrophotometry, crystallography, and intermediate analogs, we have captured several snapshots along the catalytic cycle which highlight key features in enzyme catalysis. After acting as electron donor, the enzyme-bound NADP(H) forms an H-bond with the flavin cofactor. This interaction is critical for stabilizing the oxygen-activating flavin-peroxide intermediate that results from the reaction of the reduced cofactor with oxygen. An essential active-site arginine acts as anchoring element for proper binding of the ketone substrate. Its positively charged guanidinium group can enhance the propensity of the substrate to undergo a nucleophilic attack by the flavin-peroxide intermediate. Furthermore, the arginine side chain, together with the NADP(+) ribose group, forms the niche that hosts the negatively charged Criegee intermediate that is generated upon reaction of the substrate with the flavin-peroxide. The fascinating ability of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases to catalyze a complex multistep catalytic reaction originates from concerted action of this Arg-NADP(H) pair and the flavin subsequently to promote flavin reduction, oxygen activation, tetrahedral intermediate formation, and product synthesis and release. The emerging picture is that these enzymes are mainly oxygen-activating and "Criegee-stabilizing" catalysts that act on any chemically suitable substrate that can diffuse into the active site, emphasizing their potential value as toolboxes for biocatalytic applications.</p>

<p>The X-ray structure of the complex formed between yeast 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and the inhibitor laevulinic acid has been determined at 2.15 A resolution. The inhibitor binds by forming a Schiff base link with one of the two invariant lysines at the catalytic center: Lys263. It is known that this lysine forms a Schiff base link with substrate bound at the enzyme's so-called P-site. The carboxyl group of laevulinic acid makes hydrogen bonds with the side-chain-OH groups of Tyr329 and Ser290, as well as with the main-chain &gt;NH group of Ser290. The aliphatic moiety of the inhibitor makes hydrophobic interactions with surrounding aromatic residues in the protein including Phe219, which resides in the flap covering the active site. Our analysis strongly suggests that the same interactions will be made by P-side substrate and also indicates that the substrate that binds at the enzyme's A-site will interact with the enzyme's zinc ion bound by three cysteines (133, 135, and 143). Inhibitor binding caused a substantial ordering of the active site flap (residues 217-235), which was largely invisible in the native electron density map and indicates that this highly conserved yet flexible region has a specific role in substrate binding during catalysis.</p>

<p>The haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA from Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB 13064 is a bacterial enzyme that shows catalytic activity for the hydrolytic degradation of the highly toxic industrial pollutant 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP). Mutagenesis focused on the access tunnels of DhaA produced protein variants with significantly improved activity towards TCP. Three mutants of DhaA named DhaA04 (C176Y), DhaA14 (I135F) and DhaA15 (C176Y + I135F) were constructed in order to study the functional relevance of the tunnels connecting the buried active site of the protein with the surrounding solvent. All three protein variants were crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion technique. The crystals of DhaA04 belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), while the crystals of DhaA14 and DhaA15 had triclinic symmetry in space group P1. The crystal structures of DhaA04, DhaA14 and DhaA15 with ligands present in the active site were solved and refined using diffraction data to 1.23, 0.95 and 1.22 A, resolution, respectively. Structural comparisons of the wild type and the three mutants suggest that the tunnels play a key role in the processes of ligand exchange between the buried active site and the surrounding solvent.</p>

<p>TERs (trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductases; EC 1.3.1.44), which specifically catalyse the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA using NADH as cofactor, have recently been applied in the design of robust synthetic pathways to produce butan-1-ol as a biofuel. We report in the present paper the characterization of a CaTER (a TER homologue in Clostridium acetobutylicum), the structures of CaTER in apo form and in complexes with NADH and NAD+, and the structure of TdTER (Treponema denticola TER) in complex with NAD+. Structural and sequence comparisons show that CaTER and TdTER share approximately 45% overall sequence identity and high structural similarities with the FabV class enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductases in the bacterial fatty acid synthesis pathway, suggesting that both types of enzymes belong to the same family. CaTER and TdTER function as monomers and consist of a cofactor-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain with the catalytic active site located at the interface of the two domains. Structural analyses of CaTER together with mutagenesis and biochemical data indicate that the conserved Glu75 determines the cofactor specificity, and the conserved Tyr225, Tyr235 and Lys244 play critical roles in catalysis. Upon cofactor binding, the substrate-binding loop changes from an open conformation to a closed conformation, narrowing a hydrophobic channel to the catalytic site. A modelling study shows that the hydrophobic channel is optimal in both width and length for the binding of crotonyl-CoA. These results provide molecular bases for the high substrate specificity and the catalytic mechanism of TERs.</p>

<p>Lysozymes are mostly known for their defensive role against bacteria, but in several animals lysozymes have a digestive function. Here, the initial crystallographic characterization of two digestive lysozymes from Musca domestica are presented. The proteins were crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method in the presence of ammonium sulfate or PEG/2-propanol as the precipitant. X-ray diffraction data were collected to a maximum resolution of 1.9 angstroms using synchrotron radiation. The lysozyme 1 and 2 crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P2(1) (unit-cell parameters a = 36.52, b = 79.44, c = 45.20 angstroms, beta = 102.97 degrees) and the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2 (unit-cell parameters a = 73.90, b = 96.40, c = 33.27 angstroms), respectively. The crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement and structure refinement is in progress.</p>

<p>Despite the importance of tryptophan (Trp) radicals in biology, very few radicals have been trapped and characterized in a physiologically meaningful context. Here we demonstrate that the diheme enzyme MauG uses Trp radical chemistry to catalyze formation of a Trp-derived tryptophan tryptophylquinone cofactor on its substrate protein, premethylamine dehydrogenase. The unusual six-electron oxidation that results in tryptophan tryptophylquinone formation occurs in three discrete two-electron catalytic steps. Here the exact order of these oxidation steps in the processive six-electron biosynthetic reaction is determined, and reaction intermediates are structurally characterized. The intermediates observed in crystal structures are also verified in solution using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, an unprecedented Trp-derived diradical species on premethylamine dehydrogenase, which is an intermediate in the first two-electron step, is characterized using high-frequency and -field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy. This work defines a unique mechanism for radical-mediated catalysis of a protein substrate, and has broad implications in the areas of applied biocatalysis and understanding of oxidative protein modification during oxidative stress.</p>

<p>The nonmevalonate route to isoprenoid biosynthesis is essential in Gram-negative bacteria and apicomplexan parasites. The enzymes of this pathway are absent from mammals, contributing to their appeal as chemotherapeutic targets. One enzyme, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF), has been validated as a target by genetic approaches in bacteria. Virtual screening against Escherichia coli IspF (EcIspF) was performed by combining a hierarchical filtering methodology with molecular docking. Docked compounds were inspected and 10 selected for experimental validation. A surface plasmon resonance assay was developed and two weak ligands identified. Crystal structures of EcIspF complexes were determined to support rational ligand development. Cytosine analogues and Zn(2+)-binding moieties were characterized. One of the putative Zn(2+)-binding compounds gave the lowest measured K(D) to date (1.92 +/- 0.18 muM). These data provide a framework for the development of IspF inhibitors to generate lead compounds of therapeutic potential against microbial pathogens.</p>

<p>DADH catalyzes the flavin-dependent oxidative deamination of d-amino acids to the corresponding α-keto acids and ammonia. Here we report the first X-ray crystal structures of DADH at 1.06 Å resolution and its complexes with iminoarginine (DADH(red)/iminoarginine) and iminohistidine (DADH(red)/iminohistidine) at 1.30 Å resolution. The DADH crystal structure comprises an unliganded conformation and a product-bound conformation, which is almost identical to the DADH(red)/iminoarginine crystal structure. The active site of DADH was partially occupied with iminoarginine product (30% occupancy) that interacts with Tyr53 in the minor conformation of a surface loop. This flexible loop forms an "active site lid", similar to those seen in other enzymes, and may play an essential role in substrate recognition. The guanidinium side chain of iminoarginine forms a hydrogen bond interaction with the hydroxyl of Thr50 and an ionic interaction with Glu87. In the structure of DADH in complex with iminohistidine, two alternate conformations were observed for iminohistidine where the imidazole groups formed hydrogen bond interactions with the side chains of His48 and Thr50 and either Glu87 or Gln336. The different interactions and very distinct binding modes observed for iminoarginine and iminohistidine are consistent with the 1000-fold difference in k(cat)/K(m) values for d-arginine and d-histidine. Comparison of the kinetic data for the activity of DADH on different d-amino acids and the crystal structures in complex with iminoarginine and iminohistidine establishes that this enzyme is characterized by relatively broad substrate specificity, being able to oxidize positively charged and large hydrophobic d-amino acids bound within a flask-like cavity.</p>

<p>Shikimate dehydrogenase catalyzes the fourth step of the shikimate pathway, the essential route for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds in plants and microorganisms. Absent in metazoans, this pathway is an attractive target for nontoxic herbicides and drugs. Escherichia coli expresses two shikimate dehydrogenase paralogs, the NADP-specific AroE and a putative enzyme YdiB. Here we characterize YdiB as a dual specificity quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase that utilizes either NAD or NADP as a cofactor. Structures of AroE and YdiB with bound cofactors were determined at 1.5 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. Both enzymes display a similar architecture with two alpha/beta domains separated by a wide cleft. Comparison of their dinucleotide-binding domains reveals the molecular basis for cofactor specificity. Independent molecules display conformational flexibility suggesting that a switch between open and closed conformations occurs upon substrate binding. Sequence analysis and structural comparison led us to propose the catalytic machinery and a model for 3-dehydroshikimate recognition. Furthermore, we discuss the evolutionary and metabolic implications of the presence of two shikimate dehydrogenases in E. coli and other organisms.</p>

<p>A general approach for the computational design of enzymes to catalyze arbitrary reactions is a goal at the forefront of the field of protein design. Recently, computationally designed enzymes have been produced for three chemical reactions through the synthesis and screening of a large number of variants. Here, we present an iterative approach that has led to the development of the most catalytically efficient computationally designed enzyme for the Kemp elimination to date. Previously established computational techniques were used to generate an initial design, HG-1, which was catalytically inactive. Analysis of HG-1 with molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and X-ray crystallography indicated that the inactivity might be due to bound waters and high flexibility of residues within the active site. This analysis guided changes to our design procedure, moved the design deeper into the interior of the protein, and resulted in an active Kemp eliminase, HG-2. The cocrystal structure of this enzyme with a transition state analog (TSA) revealed that the TSA was bound in the active site, interacted with the intended catalytic base in a catalytically relevant manner, but was flipped relative to the design model. MD analysis of HG-2 led to an additional point mutation, HG-3, that produced a further threefold improvement in activity. This iterative approach to computational enzyme design, including detailed MD and structural analysis of both active and inactive designs, promises a more complete understanding of the underlying principles of enzymatic catalysis and furthers progress toward reliably producing active enzymes.</p>

<p>The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) contains a gene that encodes a highly active β-lactamase, BlaC, that imparts TB with resistance to β-lactam chemotherapy. The structure of covalent BlaC-β-lactam complexes suggests that active site residues K73 and E166 are essential for acylation and deacylation, respectively. We have prepared the K73A and E166A mutant forms of BlaC and have determined the structures of the Michaelis complex of cefamandole and the covalently bound acyl intermediate of cefamandole at resolutions of 1.2 and 2.0 Å, respectively. These structures provide insight into the details of the catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a member of the Cardiovirus genus within the large Picornaviridae family, which includes a number of important human and animal pathogens. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 3D(pol) is a key enzyme for viral genome replication. In this study, we report the X-ray structures of two different crystal forms of the EMCV RdRp determined at 2.8- and 2.15-Å resolution. The in vitro elongation and VPg uridylylation activities of the purified enzyme have also been demonstrated. Although the overall structure of EMCV 3D(pol) is shown to be similar to that of the known RdRps of other members of the Picornaviridae family, structural comparisons show a large reorganization of the active-site cavity in one of the crystal forms. The rearrangement affects mainly motif A, where the conserved residue Asp240, involved in ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) selection, and its neighbor residue, Phe239, move about 10 Å from their expected positions within the ribose binding pocket toward the entrance of the rNTP tunnel. This altered conformation of motif A is stabilized by a cation-π interaction established between the aromatic ring of Phe239 and the side chain of Lys56 within the finger domain. Other contacts, involving Phe239 and different residues of motif F, are also observed. The movement of motif A is connected with important conformational changes in the finger region flanked by residues 54 to 63, harboring Lys56, and in the polymerase N terminus. The structures determined in this work provide essential information for studies on the cardiovirus RNA replication process and may have important implications for the development of new antivirals targeting the altered conformation of motif A.</p>

<p>Developing antimicrobials that are less likely to engender resistance has become an important design criterion as more and more drugs fall victim to resistance mutations. One hypothesis is that the more closely an inhibitor resembles a substrate, the more difficult it will be to develop resistant mutations that can at once disfavor the inhibitor and still recognize the substrate. To investigate this hypothesis, 10 transition-state analogues, of greater or lesser similarity to substrates, were tested for inhibition of TEM-1 beta-lactamase, the most widespread resistance enzyme to penicillin antibiotics. The inhibitors were also tested against four characteristic mutant enzymes: TEM-30, TEM-32, TEM-52, and TEM-64. The inhibitor most similar to the substrate, compound 10, was the most potent inhibitor of the WT enzyme, with a K(i) value of 64 nM. Conversely, compound 10 was the most susceptible to the TEM-30 (R244S) mutant, for which inhibition dropped by over 100-fold. The other inhibitors were relatively impervious to the TEM-30 mutant enzyme. To understand recognition and resistance to these transition-state analogues, the structures of four of these inhibitors in complex with TEM-1 were determined by X-ray crystallography. These structures suggest a structural basis for distinguishing inhibitors that mimic the acylation transition state and those that mimic the deacylation transition state; they also suggest how TEM-30 reduces the affinity of compound 10. In cell culture, this inhibitor reversed the resistance of bacteria to ampicillin, reducing minimum inhibitory concentrations of this penicillin by between 4- and 64-fold, depending on the strain of bacteria. Notwithstanding this activity, the resistance of TEM-30, which is already extant in the clinic, suggests that there can be resistance liabilities with substrate-based design.</p>

<p>Directed evolution is a valuable technique to improve enzyme activity in the absence of a priori structural knowledge, which can be typically enhanced via structure-guided strategies. In this study, a combination of both whole-gene error-prone polymerase chain reaction and site-saturation mutagenesis enabled the rapid identification of mutations that improved RmlA activity toward non-native substrates. These mutations have been shown to improve activities over 10-fold for several targeted substrates, including non-native pyrimidine- and purine-based NTPs as well as non-native D- and L-sugars (both α- and β-isomers). This study highlights the first broadly applicable high throughput sugar-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase screen and the first proof of concept for the directed evolution of this enzyme class toward the identification of uniquely permissive RmlA variants.</p>

<p>In two series of small-molecule ligands, one inhibiting human cathepsin L (hcatL) and the other MEK1 kinase, biological affinities were found to strongly increase when an aryl ring of the inhibitors is substituted with the larger halogens Cl, Br, and I, but to decrease upon F substitution. X-ray co-crystal structure analyses revealed that the higher halides engage in halogen bonding (XB) with a backbone C=O in the S3 pocket of hcatL and in a back pocket of MEK1. While the S3 pocket is located at the surface of the enzyme, which provides a polar environment, the back pocket in MEK1 is deeply buried in the protein and is of pronounced apolar character. This study analyzes environmental effects on XB in protein-ligand complexes. It is hypothesized that energetic gains by XB are predominantly not due to water replacements but originate from direct interactions between the XB donor (Caryl-X) and the XB acceptor (C=O) in the correct geometry. New X-ray co-crystal structures in the same crystal form (space group P2(1)2(1)2(1)) were obtained for aryl chloride, bromide, and iodide ligands bound to hcatL. These high-resolution structures reveal that the backbone C=O group of Gly61 in most hcatL co-crystal structures maintains water solvation while engaging in XB. An aryl-CF3-substituted ligand of hcatL with an unexpectedly high affinity was found to adopt the same binding geometry as the aryl halides, with the CF3 group pointing to the C=O group of Gly61 in the S3 pocket. In this case, a repulsive F2C-F⋅⋅⋅O=C contact apparently is energetically overcompensated by other favorable protein-ligand contacts established by the CF3 group.</p>

<p>The enzymatic degradation of plant polysaccharides is emerging as one of the key environmental goals of the early 21st century, impacting on many processes in the textile and detergent industries as well as biomass conversion to biofuels. One of the well known problems with the use of nonstarch (nonfood)-based substrates such as the plant cell wall is that the cellulose fibers are embedded in a network of diverse polysaccharides, including xyloglucan, that renders access difficult. There is therefore increasing interest in the "accessory enzymes," including xyloglucanases, that may aid biomass degradation through removal of "hemicellulose" polysaccharides. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the endo-β-1,4-(xylo)glucan hydrolase from Paenibacillus polymyxa with polymeric, oligomeric, and defined chromogenic aryl-oligosaccharide substrates. The enzyme displays an unusual specificity on defined xyloglucan oligosaccharides, cleaving the XXXG-XXXG repeat into XXX and GXXXG. Kinetic analysis on defined oligosaccharides and on aryl-glycosides suggests that both the -4 and +1 subsites show discrimination against xylose-appended glucosides. The three-dimensional structures of PpXG44 have been solved both in apo-form and as a series of ligand complexes that map the -3 to -1 and +1 to +5 subsites of the extended ligand binding cleft. Complex structures are consistent with partial intolerance of xylosides in the -4' subsites. The atypical specificity of PpXG44 may thus find use in industrial processes involving xyloglucan degradation, such as biomass conversion, or in the emerging exciting applications of defined xyloglucans in food, pharmaceuticals, and cellulose fiber modification.</p>

<p>The class I terpenoid cyclase epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS) utilizes the universal achiral isoprenoid substrate, farnesyl diphosphate, to generate epi-isozizaene as the predominant sesquiterpene cyclization product and at least five minor sesquiterpene products, making EIZS an ideal platform for the exploration of fidelity and promiscuity in a terpenoid cyclization reaction. The hydrophobic active site contour of EIZS serves as a template that enforces a single substrate conformation, and chaperones subsequently formed carbocation intermediates through a well-defined mechanistic sequence. Here, we have used the crystal structure of EIZS as a guide to systematically remold the hydrophobic active site contour in a library of 26 site-specific mutants. Remolded cyclization templates reprogram the reaction cascade not only by reproportioning products generated by the wild-type enzyme but also by generating completely new products of diverse structure. Specifically, we have tripled the overall number of characterized products generated by EIZS. Moreover, we have converted EIZS into six different sesquiterpene synthases: F96A EIZS is an (E)-β-farnesene synthase, F96W EIZS is a zizaene synthase, F95H EIZS is a β-curcumene synthase, F95M EIZS is a β-acoradiene synthase, F198L EIZS is a β-cedrene synthase, and F96V EIZS and W203F EIZS are (Z)-γ-bisabolene synthases. Active site aromatic residues appear to be hot spots for reprogramming the cyclization cascade by manipulating the stability and conformation of critical carbocation intermediates. A majority of mutant enzymes exhibit only relatively modest 2-100-fold losses of catalytic activity, suggesting that residues responsible for triggering substrate ionization readily tolerate mutations deeper in the active site cavity. </p>

<p>Thymidine-3'-monophosphate (3'-TMP) is a competitive inhibitor analogue of the 3'-CMP and 3'-UMP natural product inhibitors of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A). Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments show that 3'-TMP binds the enzyme with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 15 microM making it one of the strongest binding members of the five natural bases found in nucleic acids (A, C, G, T, and U). To further investigate the molecular properties of this potent natural affinity, we have determined the crystal structure of bovine pancreatic RNase A in complex with 3'-TMP at 1.55 A resolution and we have performed NMR binding experiments with 3'-CMP and 3'-TMP. Our results show that binding of 3'-TMP is very similar to other natural and non-natural pyrimidine ligands, demonstrating that single nucleotide affinity is independent of the presence or absence of a 2'-hydroxyl on the ribose moiety of pyrimidines and suggesting that the pyrimidine binding subsite of RNase A is not a significant contributor of inhibitor discrimination. Accumulating evidence suggests that very subtle structural, chemical, and potentially motional variations contribute to ligand discrimination in this enzyme.</p>

<p>Plasmodium and other apicomplexan parasites are deficient in purine biosynthesis, relying instead on the salvage of purines from their host environment. Therefore, interference with the purine salvage pathway is an attractive therapeutic target. The plasmodial enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) plays a central role in purine salvage and, unlike mammalian ADA homologs, has a further secondary role in methylthiopurine recycling. For this reason, plasmodial ADA accepts a wider range of substrates, as it is responsible for deamination of both adenosine and 5'-methylthioadenosine. The latter substrate is not accepted by mammalian ADA homologs. The structural basis for this natural difference in specificity between plasmodial and mammalian ADA has not been well understood. We now report crystal structures of Plasmodium vivax ADA in complex with adenosine, guanosine, and the picomolar inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin. These structures highlight a drastic conformational change in plasmodial ADA upon substrate binding that has not been observed for mammalian ADA enzymes. Further, these complexes illuminate the structural basis for the differential substrate specificity and potential drug selectivity between mammalian and parasite enzymes.</p>

<p>The first step of the shikimate pathway for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). Thermotoga maritima DAH7PS (TmaDAH7PS) is tetrameric, with monomer units comprised of a core catalytic (β/α)(8) barrel and an N-terminal domain. This enzyme is inhibited strongly by tyrosine and to a lesser extent by the presence of phenylalanine. A truncated mutant of TmaDAH7PS lacking the N-terminal domain was catalytically more active and completely insensitive to tyrosine and phenylalanine, consistent with a role for this domain in allosteric inhibition. The structure of this protein was determined to 2.0 Å. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, this enzyme is dimeric. Wild-type TmaDAH7PS was co-crystallized with tyrosine, and the structure of this complex was determined to a resolution of 2.35 Å. Tyrosine was found to bind at the interface between two regulatory N-terminal domains, formed from diagonally located monomers of the tetramer, revealing a major reorganization of the regulatory domain with respect to the barrel relative to unliganded enzyme. This significant conformational rearrangement observed in the crystal structures was also clearly evident from small angle X-ray scattering measurements recorded in the presence and absence of tyrosine. The closed conformation adopted by the protein on tyrosine binding impedes substrate entry into the neighboring barrel, revealing an unusual tyrosine-controlled gating mechanism for allosteric control of this enzyme.</p>

<p>Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) and related compounds cause DNA damage and are widely used as anticancer agents. Chemoresistance to cisplatin treatment is due in part to translesion synthesis by human DNA polymerase η (hPol η). Here, we report crystal structures of hPol η complexed with intrastrand cisplatin-1,2-cross-linked DNA, representing four consecutive steps in translesion synthesis. In contrast to the generally enlarged and nondiscriminating active site of Y-family polymerases like Dpo4, Pol η is specialized for efficient bypass of UV-cross-linked pyrimidine dimers. Human Pol η differs from the yeast homolog in its binding of DNA template. To incorporate deoxycytidine opposite cisplatin-cross-linked guanines, hPol η undergoes a specific backbone rearrangement to accommodate the larger base dimer and minimizes the DNA distortion around the lesion. Our structural analyses show why Pol η is inefficient at extending primers after cisplatin lesions, which necessitates a second translesion DNA polymerase to complete bypass in vivo. A hydrophobic pocket near the primer-binding site in human Pol η is identified as a potential drug target for inhibiting translesion synthesis and, thereby, reducing chemoresistance.</p>

<p>NAD(+) is an essential metabolite both as a cofactor in energy metabolism and redox homeostasis and as a regulator of cellular processes. In contrast to humans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis NAD(+) biosynthesis is absolutely dependent on the activity of a multifunctional glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetase, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of NAD(+) at the synthetase domain using ammonia derived from L-glutamine in the glutaminase domain. Here we report the kinetics and structural characterization of M. tuberculosis NAD(+) synthetase. The kinetics data strongly suggest tightly coupled regulation of the catalytic activities. The structure, the first of a glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetase, reveals a homooctameric subunit organization suggesting a tight dependence of catalysis on the quaternary structure, a 40-A intersubunit ammonia tunnel and structural elements that may be involved in the transfer of information between catalytic sites.</p>

<p>S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), also known as S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione (HMGSH) dehydrogenase, belongs to the large alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily, namely to the class III ADHs. GSNOR catalyses the oxidation of HMGSH to S-formylglutathione using a catalytic zinc and NAD(+) as a coenzyme. The enzyme also catalyses the NADH-dependent reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). In plants, GSNO has been suggested to serve as a nitric oxide (NO) reservoir locally or possibly as NO donor in distant cells and tissues. NO and NO-related molecules such as S-nitrosothiols (S-NOs) play a central role in the regulation of normal plant physiological processes and host defence. The enzyme thus participates in the cellular homeostasis of S-NOs and in the metabolism of reactive nitrogen species. Although GSNOR has recently been characterized from several organisms, this study represents the first detailed biochemical and structural characterization of a plant GSNOR, that from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). SlGSNOR gene expression is higher in roots and stems compared to leaves of young plants. It is highly expressed in the pistil and stamens and in fruits during ripening. The enzyme is a dimer and preferentially catalyses reduction of GSNO while glutathione and S-methylglutathione behave as non-competitive inhibitors. Using NAD(+), the enzyme oxidizes HMGSH and other alcohols such as cinnamylalcohol, geraniol and ω-hydroxyfatty acids. The crystal structures of the apoenzyme, of the enzyme in complex with NAD(+) and in complex with NADH, solved up to 1.9 Å resolution, represent the first structures of a plant GSNOR. They confirm that the binding of the coenzyme is associated with the active site zinc movement and changes in its coordination. In comparison to the well characterized human GSNOR, plant GSNORs exhibit a difference in the composition of the anion-binding pocket, which negatively influences the affinity for the carboxyl group of ω-hydroxyfatty acids.</p>

<p>Bacterial UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGlcDH) is essential for formation of the antiphagocytic capsule that protects many virulent bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes andStreptococcus pneumoniae type 3 from the host's immune system. We have determined the X-ray structures of both native and Cys260Ser UDPGlcDH from S. pyogenes (74% similarity to S. pneumoniae) in ternary complexes with UDP-xylose/NAD(+) and UDP-glucuronic acid/NAD(H), respectively. The 402 residue homodimeric UDPGlcDH is composed of an N-terminal NAD(+) dinucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal UDP-sugar binding domain connected by a long (48 A) central alpha-helix. The first 290 residues of UDPGlcDH share structural homology with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, including conservation of an active site lysine and asparagine that are implicated in the enzyme mechanism. Also proposed to participate in the catalytic mechanism are a threonine and a glutamate that hydrogen bond to a conserved active site water molecule suitably positioned for general acid/base catalysis.</p>

<p>Mannose trimming is not only essential for N-glycan maturation in mammalian cells but also triggers degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. The crystal structure of the class I alpha1, 2-mannosidase that trims Man(9)GlcNAc(2) to Man(8)GlcNAc(2 )isomer B in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals a novel (alphaalpha)(7)-barrel in which an N-glycan from one molecule extends into the barrel of an adjacent molecule, interacting with the essential acidic residues and calcium ion. The observed protein-carbohydrate interactions provide the first insight into the catalytic mechanism and specificity of this eukaryotic enzyme family and may be used to design inhibitors that prevent degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in genetic diseases.</p>

<p>Human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) hydrolyzes or scavenges a wide range of toxic esters, including heroin, cocaine, carbamate pesticides, organophosphorus pesticides, and nerve agents. Organophosphates (OPs) exert their acute toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by phosphorylation of the catalytic serine. Phosphylated cholinesterase (ChE) can undergo a spontaneous, time-dependent process called "aging", during which the OP-ChE conjugate is dealkylated. This leads to irreversible inhibition of the enzyme. The inhibition of ChEs by tabun and the subsequent aging reaction are of particular interest, because tabun-ChE conjugates display an extraordinary resistance toward most current oxime reactivators. We investigated the structural basis of oxime resistance for phosphoramidated ChE conjugates by determining the crystal structures of the non-aged and aged forms of hBChE inhibited by tabun, and by updating the refinement of non-aged and aged tabun-inhibited mouse AChE (mAChE). Structures for non-aged and aged tabun-hBChE were refined to 2.3 and 2.1 A, respectively. The refined structures of aged ChE conjugates clearly show that the aging reaction proceeds through O-dealkylation of the P(R) enantiomer of tabun. After dealkylation, the negatively charged oxygen forms a strong salt bridge with protonated His438N epsilon2 that prevents reactivation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the aged tabun-inhibited hBChE showed that both the dimethylamine and ethoxy side chains were missing from the phosphorus. Loss of the ethoxy is consistent with the crystallography results. Loss of the dimethylamine is consistent with acid-catalyzed deamidation during the preparation of the aged adduct for mass spectrometry. The reported 3D data will help in the design of new oximes capable of reactivating tabun-ChE conjugates.</p>

<p>A loop (residues 794-803) at the active site of β-galactosidase (Escherichia coli) opens and closes during catalysis. The α and β carbons of Ser-796 form a hydrophobic connection to Phe-601 when the loop is closed while a connection via two H-bonds with the Ser hydroxyl occurs with the loop open. β-Galactosidases with substitutions for Ser-796 were investigated. Replacement by Ala strongly stabilizes the closed conformation because of greater hydrophobicity and loss of H-bonding ability while replacement with Thr stabilizes the open form through hydrophobic interactions with its methyl group. Upon substitution with Asp much of the defined loop structure is lost. The different open-closed equilibria cause differences in the stabilities of the enzyme·substrate and enzyme·transition state complexes and of the covalent intermediate that affect the activation thermodynamics. With Ala, large changes of both the galactosylation (k(2)) and degalactosylation (k(3)) rates occur. With Thr and Asp, the k(2) and k(3) were not changed as much but large ΔH(‡) and TΔS(‡) changes showed that the substitutions caused mechanistic changes. Overall, the hydrophobic and H-bonding properties of Ser-796 result in interactions strong enough to stabilize the open or closed conformations of the loop but weak enough to allow loop movement during the reaction.</p>

<p>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase/phosphatase is a bifunctional, thermostable enzyme that catalyses two subsequent steps in gluconeogenesis in most archaea and in deeply branching bacterial lineages. It mediates the aldol condensation of heat-labile dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to FBP, as well as the subsequent, irreversible hydrolysis of the product to yield the stable fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and inorganic phosphate; no reaction intermediates are released. Here we present a series of structural snapshots of the reaction that reveal a substantial remodelling of the active site through the movement of loop regions that create different catalytic functionalities at the same location. We have solved the three-dimensional structures of FBP aldolase/phosphatase from thermophilic Thermoproteus neutrophilus in a ligand-free state as well as in complex with the substrates DHAP and FBP and the product F6P to resolutions up to 1.3 Å. In conjunction with mutagenesis data, this pinpoints the residues required for the two reaction steps and shows that the sequential binding of additional Mg(2+) cations reversibly facilitates the reaction. FBP aldolase/phosphatase is an ancestral gluconeogenic enzyme optimized for high ambient temperatures, and our work resolves how consecutive structural rearrangements reorganize the catalytic centre of the protein to carry out two canonical reactions in a very non-canonical type of bifunctionality.</p>

<p>A class of 2-acyliminobenzimidazoles has been developed as potent and selective inhibitors of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Structure based design facilitated the rapid development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) and the optimization of kinase selectivity. Introduction of an optimally placed polar substituent was key to solving issues of metabolic stability and led to the development of potent, selective, orally bioavailable ALK inhibitors. Compound 49 achieved substantial tumor regression in an NPM-ALK driven murine tumor xenograft model when dosed qd.

<p>Tri-o-cresyl-phosphate (TOCP) is a common additive in jet engine lubricants and hydraulic fluids suspected to have a role in aerotoxic syndrome in humans. TOCP is metabolized to cresyl saligenin phosphate (CBDP), a potent irreversible inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a natural bioscavenger present in the bloodstream, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the off-switch at cholinergic synapses. Mechanistic details of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition have, however, remained elusive. Also, the inhibition of AChE by CBDP is unexpected, from a structural standpoint, i.e., considering the narrowness of AChE active site and the bulkiness of CBDP. In the following, we report on kinetic X-ray crystallography experiments that provided 2.7-3.3 Å snapshots of the reaction of CBDP with mouse AChE and human BChE. The series of crystallographic snapshots reveals that AChE and BChE react with the opposite enantiomers and that an induced-fit rearrangement of Phe297 enlarges the active site of AChE upon CBDP binding. Mass spectrometry analysis of aging in either H(2)(16)O or H(2)(18)O furthermore allowed us to identify the inhibition steps, in which water molecules are involved, thus providing insights into the mechanistic details of inhibition. X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry show the formation of an aged end product formed in both AChE and BChE that cannot be reactivated by current oxime-based therapeutics. Our study thus shows that only prophylactic and symptomatic treatments are viable to counter the inhibition of AChE and BChE by CBDP.</p>

<p>Glycogenin initiates the synthesis of a maltosaccharide chain covalently attached to itself on Tyr195 via a stepwise glucosylation reaction, priming glycogen synthesis. We have captured crystallographic snapshots of human glycogenin during its reaction cycle, revealing a dynamic conformational switch between ground and active states mediated by the sugar donor UDP-glucose. This switch includes the ordering of a polypeptide stretch containing Tyr195, and major movement of an approximately 30-residue "lid" segment covering the active site. The rearranged lid guides the nascent maltosaccharide chain into the active site in either an intra- or intersubunit mode dependent upon chain length and steric factors and positions the donor and acceptor sugar groups for catalysis. The Thr83Met mutation, which causes glycogen storage disease XV, is conformationally locked in the ground state and catalytically inactive. Our data highlight the conformational plasticity of glycogenin and coexistence of two modes of glucosylation as integral to its catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Cancer cells engage in a metabolic program to enhance biosynthesis and support cell proliferation. The regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) influence altered glucose metabolism in cancer. The interaction of PKM2 with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins inhibits enzyme activity and increases the availability of glycolytic metabolites to support cell proliferation. This suggests that high pyruvate kinase activity may suppress tumor growth. We show that expression of PKM1, the pyruvate kinase isoform with high constitutive activity, or exposure to published small-molecule PKM2 activators inhibits the growth of xenograft tumors. Structural studies reveal that small-molecule activators bind PKM2 at the subunit interaction interface, a site that is distinct from that of the endogenous activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). However, unlike FBP, binding of activators to PKM2 promotes a constitutively active enzyme state that is resistant to inhibition by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. These data support the notion that small-molecule activation of PKM2 can interfere with anabolic metabolism.</p>

<p>Various inositide phosphatases participate in the regulation of inositol polyphosphate signaling molecules. Plant phytases are phosphatases that hydrolyze phytate to less-phosphorylated myo-inositol derivatives and phosphate. The phytase from Selenomonas ruminantium shares no sequence homology with other microbial phytases. Its crystal structure revealed a phytase fold of the dual-specificity phosphatase type. The active site is located near a conserved cysteine-containing (Cys241) P loop. We also solved two other crystal forms in which an inhibitor, myo-inositol hexasulfate, is cocrystallized with the enzyme. In the "standby" and the "inhibited" crystal forms, the inhibitor is bound, respectively, in a pocket slightly away from Cys241 and at the substrate binding site where the phosphate group to be hydrolyzed is held close to the -SH group of Cys241. Our structural and mutagenesis studies allow us to visualize the way in which the P loop-containing phytase attracts and hydrolyzes the substrate (phytate) sequentially.</p>

<p>In vertebrates ecto-5'-nucleotidase (e5NT) catalyzes the hydrolysis of extracellular AMP to adenosine and represents the major control point for extracellular adenosine levels. Due to its pivotal role for activation of P1 adenosine receptors, e5NT has emerged as an appealing drug target for treatment of inflammation, chronic pain, hypoxia, and cancer. Crystal structures of the dimeric human e5NT reveal an extensive 114° conformational switch between the open and closed forms of the enzyme. The dimerization interface is formed by the C-terminal domains and exhibits interchain motions of up to 13°. Complex structures with adenosine and AMPCP indicate that structural control of the domain movement determines the selectivity for monophosphate nucleotides. Binding modes of nucleotide-derived and flavonoid-based compounds complexed to the C-terminal domain in the open form reveal an additional binding pocket of ∼210 Å(3) that might be explored to design more potent inhibitors.</p>

<p>Non-covalent interactions between protein and ligand at the active centre of glycosidases play an enormous role in catalysis. Dissection of these hydrogen-bonding networks is not merely important for an understanding of enzymatic catalysis, but is also increasingly relevant for the design of transition-state mimics, whose tautomeric state, hydrogen-bonding interactions and protonation contribute to tight binding. Here, atomic resolution ( approximately 1 A) analysis of a series of complexes of the 34 kDa catalytic core domain of the Bacillus agaradhaerens endoglucanase Cel5A is presented. Cel5A is a 'retaining' endoglucanase which performs catalysis via the formation and subsequent breakdown of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate via oxocarbenium-ion-like transition states. Previous medium-resolution analyses of a series of enzymatic snapshots has revealed conformational changes in the substrate along the reaction coordinate (Davies et al., 1998). Here, atomic resolution analyses of the series of complexes along the pathway are presented, including the 'Michaelis' complex of the unhydrolysed substrate, the covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate and the complex with the reaction product, cellotriose. These structures reveal intimate details of the protein-ligand interactions, including most of the carbohydrate-associated H atoms and the tautomeric state of crucial active-centre groups in the pH 5 orthorhombic crystal form and serve to illustrate the potential for atomic resolution analyses to inform strategies for enzyme inhibition.</p>

<p>A universal step in the biosynthesis of membrane sterols and steroid hormones is the oxidative removal of the 14alpha-methyl group from sterol precursors by sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51). This enzyme is a primary target in treatment of fungal infections in organisms ranging from humans to plants, and development of more potent and selective CYP51 inhibitors is an important biological objective. Our continuing interest in structural aspects of substrate and inhibitor recognition in CYP51 led us to determine (to a resolution of 1.95A) the structure of CYP51 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CYP51(Mt)) co-crystallized with 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHBP), a small organic molecule previously identified among top type I binding hits in a library screened against CYP51(Mt). The newly determined CYP51(Mt)-DHBP structure is the most complete to date and is an improved template for three-dimensional modeling of CYP51 enzymes from fungal and prokaryotic pathogens. The structure demonstrates the induction of conformational fit of the flexible protein regions and the interactions of conserved Phe-89 essential for both fungal drug resistance and catalytic function, which were obscure in the previously characterized CYP51(Mt)-estriol complex. DHBP represents a benzophenone scaffold binding in the CYP51 active site via a type I mechanism, suggesting (i) a possible new class of CYP51 inhibitors targeting flexible regions, (ii) an alternative catalytic function for bacterial CYP51 enzymes, and (iii) a potential for hydroxybenzophenones, widely distributed in the environment, to interfere with sterol biosynthesis. Finally, we show the inhibition of M. tuberculosis growth by DHBP in a mouse macrophage model.</p>

<p>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a critical role in the circulating or endocrine renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as well as the local regulation that exists in tissues such as the myocardium and skeletal muscle. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of testis ACE (tACE) in complex with the first successfully designed ACE inhibitor captopril and enalaprilat, the Phe-Ala-Pro analogue. We have compared these structures with the recently reported structure of a tACE-lisinopril complex [Natesh et al. (2003) Nature 421, 551-554]. The analyses reveal that all three inhibitors make direct interactions with the catalytic Zn(2+) ion at the active site of the enzyme: the thiol group of captopril and the carboxylate group of enalaprilat and lisinopril. Subtle differences are also observed at other regions of the binding pocket. These are compared with N-domain models and discussed with reference to published biochemical data. The chloride coordination geometries of the three structures are discussed and compared with other ACE analogues. It is anticipated that the molecular details provided by these structures will be used to improve the binding and/or the design of new, more potent domain-specific inhibitors of ACE that could serve as new generation antihypertensive drugs.</p>

<p>The prevalence of tuberculosis, the prolonged and expensive treatment that this disease requires and an increase in drug resistance indicate an urgent need for new treatments. The 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway of isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis is an attractive chemotherapeutic target because it occurs in many pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and is absent from humans. To underpin future drug development it is important to assess which enzymes in this biosynthetic pathway are essential in the actual pathogens and to characterize them.</p>

<p>The binding of indirubin-5-sulphonate (E226), a potential anti-tumour agent and a potent inhibitor (IC(50) = 35 nm) of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) has been studied by kinetic and crystallographic methods. Kinetic analysis revealed that E226 is a moderate inhibitor of GPb (K(i) = 13.8 +/- 0.2 micro m) and GPa (K(i) = 57.8 +/- 7.1 micro m) and acts synergistically with glucose. To explore the molecular basis of E226 binding we have determined the crystal structure of the GPb/E226 complex at 2.3 A resolution. Structure analysis shows clearly that E226 binds at the purine inhibitor site, where caffeine and flavopiridol also bind [Oikonomakos, N.G., Schnier, J.B., Zographos, S.E., Skamnaki, V.T., Tsitsanou, K.E. &amp; Johnson, L.N. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.275, 34566-34573], by intercalating between the two aromatic rings of Phe285 and Tyr613. The mode of binding of E226 to GPb is similar, but not identical, to that of caffeine and flavopiridol. Comparative structural analyses of the GPb-E226, GPb-caffeine and GPb-flavopiridol complex structures reveal the structural basis of the differences in the potencies of the three inhibitors and indicate binding residues in the inhibitor site that can be exploited to obtain more potent inhibitors. Structural comparison of the GPb-E226 complex structure with the active pCDK2-cyclin A-E226 complex structure clearly shows the different binding modes of the ligand to GPb and CDK2; the more extensive interactions of E226 with the active site of CDK2 may explain its higher affinity towards the latter enzyme.</p>

<p>Invasive infections of Streptococcus pyogenes are dependent on the cysteine protease streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B. Previous structures of the enzyme have not disclosed the proper active-site configuration. Here, the crystal structure of the mature enzyme is presented to 1.55 A, disclosing a homodimer. A serine from one subunit inserts into the active site of the other to donate to the oxyanion hole and coordinates the ligand proximal to the active-site cysteine. Dimerization is unique to the mature form and is clearly a prerequisite for catalysis. The present structure supports a tripartite switch system that is triggered upon dimerization and substrate binding: (1) liberation of the active-site histidine from an inactive configuration, (2) relocation of residues blocking the substrate binding pockets and (3) repositioning of two active-site tryptophans to settle in the active configuration. Based on the present structure, the active site of clan CA cysteine proteases is expanded and a detailed mechanism of the deacylation mechanism is proposed. The results may have applications for the development of protease inhibitors specific to bacterial cysteine proteases.</p>

<p>Virtual screening against a pCDK2/cyclin A crystal structure led to the identification of a potent and novel CDK2 inhibitor, which exhibited an unusual mode of interaction with the kinase binding motif. With the aid of X-ray crystallography and modelling, a medicinal chemistry strategy was implemented to probe the interactions seen in the crystal structure and to establish SAR. A fragment-based approach was also considered but a different, more conventional, binding mode was observed. Compound selectivity against GSK-3beta was improved using a rational design strategy, with crystallographic verification of the CDK2 binding mode.</p>

<p>Computational design is a test of our understanding of enzyme catalysis and a means of engineering novel, tailor-made enzymes. While the de novo computational design of catalytically efficient enzymes remains a challenge, designed enzymes may comprise unique starting points for further optimization by directed evolution. Directed evolution of two computationally designed Kemp eliminases, KE07 and KE70, led to low to moderately efficient enzymes (k(cat)/K(m) values of ≤ 5 10(4) M(-1)s(-1)). Here we describe the optimization of a third design, KE59. Although KE59 was the most catalytically efficient Kemp eliminase from this design series (by k(cat)/K(m), and by catalyzing the elimination of nonactivated benzisoxazoles), its impaired stability prevented its evolutionary optimization. To boost KE59's evolvability, stabilizing consensus mutations were included in the libraries throughout the directed evolution process. The libraries were also screened with less activated substrates. Sixteen rounds of mutation and selection led to &gt; 2,000-fold increase in catalytic efficiency, mainly via higher k(cat) values. The best KE59 variants exhibited k(cat)/K(m) values up to 0.6 10(6) M(-1)s(-1), and k(cat)/k(uncat) values of ≤ 10(7) almost regardless of substrate reactivity. Biochemical, structural, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies provided insights regarding the optimization of KE59. Overall, the directed evolution of three different designed Kemp eliminases, KE07, KE70, and KE59, demonstrates that computational designs are highly evolvable and can be optimized to high catalytic efficiencies.</p>

<p>Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5'-monophosphates and participates in the regulation of purine nucleotide pools within the cell. It interferes with the phosphorylation-dependent activation of nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of cancer and viral diseases. It is allosterically activated by a number of phosphate-containing cellular metabolites such as ATP, diadenosine polyphosphates, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which couple its activity with the metabolic state of the cell. We present seven high-resolution structures of human cN-II, including a ligand-free form and complexes with various substrates and effectors. These structures reveal the structural basis for the allosteric activation of cN-II, uncovering a mechanism where an effector-induced disorder-to-order transition generates rearrangements within the catalytic site and the subsequent coordination of the catalytically essential magnesium. Central to the activation is the large transition of the catalytically essential Asp356. This study also provides the structural basis for the substrate specificity of cN-II, where Arg202, Asp206, and Phe157 seem to be important residues for purine/pyrimidine selectivity. These structures provide a comprehensive structural basis for the design of cN-II inhibitors. They also contribute to the understanding of how the nucleotide salvage pathway is regulated at a molecular level.</p>

<p>Modeling of the tetrahedral intermediate within the active site of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase revealed a specific interaction with the side-chain of Gln137, an interaction not previously observed in the structure of the X-ray enzyme in the presence of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA). Previous site-specific mutagenesis experiments showed that when Gln137 was replaced by alanine, the resulting mutant enzyme (Q137A) exhibited approximately 50-fold less activity than the wild-type enzyme, exhibited no homotropic cooperativity, and the binding of both carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate were extremely compromised. To elucidate the structural alterations in the mutant enzyme that might lead to such pronounced changes in kinetic and binding properties, the Q137A enzyme was studied by time-resolved, small-angle X-ray scattering and its structure was determined in the presence of PALA to 2.7 angstroms resolution. Time-resolved, small-angle X-ray scattering established that the natural substrates, carbamoyl phosphate and L-aspartate, do not induce in the Q137A enzyme the same conformational changes as observed for the wild-type enzyme, although the scattering pattern of the Q137A and wild-type enzymes in the presence of PALA were identical. The overall structure of the Q137A enzyme is similar to that of the R-state structure of wild-type enzyme with PALA bound. However, there are differences in the manner by which the Q137A enzyme coordinates PALA, especially in the side-chain positions of Arg105 and His134. The replacement of Gln137 by Ala also has a dramatic effect on the electrostatics of the active site. These data taken together suggest that the side-chain of Gln137 in the wild-type enzyme is required for the binding of carbamoyl phosphate in the proper orientation so as to induce conformational changes required for the creation of the high-affinity aspartate-binding site. The inability of carbamoyl phosphate to create the high-affinity binding site in the Q137A enzyme results in an enzyme locked in the low-activity low-affinity T state. These results emphasize the absolute requirement of the binding of carbamoyl phosphate for the creation of the high-affinity aspartate-binding site and for inducing the homotropic cooperativity in aspartate transcarbamoylase.</p>

<p>Heme enzymes are ubiquitous in biology and catalyze a vast array of biological redox processes. The formation of high valent ferryl intermediates of the heme iron (known as Compounds I and Compound II) is implicated for a number of catalytic heme enzymes, but these species are formed only transiently and thus have proved somewhat elusive. In consequence, there has been conflicting evidence as to the nature of these ferryl intermediates in a number of different heme enzymes, in particular the precise nature of the bond between the heme iron and the bound oxygen atom. In this work, we present high resolution crystal structures of both Compound I and Compound II intermediates in two different heme peroxidase enzymes, cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, allowing direct and accurate comparison of the bonding interactions in the different intermediates. A consistent picture emerges across all structures, showing lengthening of the ferryl oxygen bond (and presumed protonation) on reduction of Compound I to Compound II. These data clarify long standing inconsistencies on the nature of the ferryl heme species in these intermediates.</p>

<p>Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides, which constitute the precursor pools used for DNA synthesis and repair. Imbalances in these pools increase mutational rates and are detrimental to the cell. Balanced precursor pools are maintained primarily through the regulation of the RNR substrate specificity. Here, the molecular mechanism of the allosteric substrate specificity regulation is revealed through the structures of a dimeric coenzyme B12-dependent RNR from Thermotoga maritima, both in complexes with four effector-substrate nucleotide pairs and in three complexes with only effector. The mechanism is based on the flexibility of loop 2, a key structural element, which forms a bridge between the specificity effector and substrate nucleotides. Substrate specificity is achieved as different effectors and their cognate substrates stabilize specific discrete loop 2 conformations. The mechanism of substrate specificity regulation is probably general for most class I and class II RNRs.</p>

<p>The aldo-keto reductase (AKR) human type 3 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (h3alpha-HSD3, AKR1C2) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the intracellular concentrations of testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha-DHT), two steroids directly linked to the etiology and the progression of many prostate diseases and cancer. This enzyme also binds many structurally different molecules such as 4-hydroxynonenal, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and indanone. To understand the mechanism underlying the plasticity of its substrate-binding site, we solved the binary complex structure of h3alpha-HSD3-NADP(H) at 1.9 A resolution. During the refinement process, we found acetate and citrate molecules deeply engulfed in the steroid-binding cavity. Superimposition of this structure with the h3alpha-HSD3-NADP(H)-testosterone/acetate ternary complex structure reveals that one of the mobile loops forming the binding cavity operates a slight contraction movement against the citrate molecule while the side chains of many residues undergo numerous conformational changes, probably to create an optimal binding site for the citrate. These structural changes, which altogether cause a reduction of the substrate-binding cavity volume (from 776 A(3) in the presence of testosterone/acetate to 704 A(3) in the acetate/citrate complex), are reminiscent of the "induced-fit" mechanism previously proposed for the aldose reductase, another member of the AKR superfamily. We also found that the replacement of residues Arg(301) and Arg(304), localized near the steroid-binding cavity, significantly affects the 3alpha-HSD activity of this enzyme toward 5alpha-DHT and completely abolishes its 17beta-HSD activity on 4-dione. All these results have thus been used to reevaluate the binding mode of this enzyme for androgens.</p>

<p>The reduction of dehydroascorbate (DHA) to ascorbic acid (AA) is a vital cellular function. The omega-class glutathione transferases (GSTs) catalyze several reductive reactions in cellular biochemistry, including DHA reduction. In humans, two isozymes (GSTO1-1 and GSTO2-2) with significant DHA reductase (DHAR) activity are found, sharing 64% sequence identity. While the activity of GSTO2-2 is higher, it is significantly more unstable in vitro. We report the first crystal structures of human GSTO2-2, stabilized through site-directed mutagenesis and determined at 1.9 Å resolution in the presence and absence of glutathione (GSH). The structure of a human GSTO1-1 has been determined at 1.7 Å resolution in complex with the reaction product AA, which unexpectedly binds in the G-site, where the glutamyl moiety of GSH binds. The structure suggests a similar mode of ascorbate binding in GSTO2-2. This is the first time that a non-GSH-based reaction product has been observed in the G-site of any GST. AA stacks against a conserved aromatic residue, F34 (equivalent to Y34 in GSTO2-2). Mutation of Y34 to alanine in GSTO2-2 eliminates DHAR activity. From these structures and other biochemical data, we propose a mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis of DHAR activity.</p>

<p>A new aspartic protease inhibitory chemotype bearing a 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazoline ring was identified by high-throughput screening for the inhibition of BACE-1. X-ray crystallography revealed that the exocyclic amino group participated in a hydrogen bonding array with the two catalytic aspartic acids of BACE-1 (Asp(32), Asp(228)). BACE-1 inhibitory potency was increased (0.9 microM to 11 nM K(i)) by substitution into the unoccupied S(1)' pocket.</p>

<p>Structure-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors are described. In an effort to enhance interactions with protease backbone atoms, we have incorporated stereochemically defined methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and methyl oxazolidinone as the P1'-ligands. These ligands are designed to interact with Gly-27' carbonyl and Arg-8 side chain in the S1'-subsite of the HIV protease. We have investigated the potential of these ligands in combination with our previously developed bis-tetrahydrofuran (bis-THF) and cyclopentanyltetrahydrofuran (Cp-THF) as the P2-ligands. Inhibitor 19b with a (R)-aminomethyl-2-pyrrolidinone and a Cp-THF was shown to be the most potent compound. This inhibitor maintained near full potency against multi-PI-resistant clinical HIV-1 variants. A high resolution protein-ligand X-ray crystal structure of 19b-bound HIV-1 protease revealed that the P1'-pyrrolidinone heterocycle and the P2-Cp-ligand are involved in several critical interactions with the backbone atoms in the S1' and S2 subsites of HIV-1 protease.</p>

<p>To address questions regarding the mechanism of serine protease catalysis, we have solved two X-ray crystal structures of alpha-lytic protease (alphaLP) that mimic aspects of the transition states: alphaLP at pH 5 (0.82 A resolution) and alphaLP bound to the peptidyl boronic acid inhibitor, MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-boroVal (0.90 A resolution). Based on these structures, there is no evidence of, or requirement for, histidine-flipping during the acylation step of the reaction. Rather, our data suggests that upon protonation of His57, Ser195 undergoes a conformational change that destabilizes the His57-Ser195 hydrogen bond, preventing the back-reaction. In both structures the His57-Asp102 hydrogen bond in the catalytic triad is a normal ionic hydrogen bond, and not a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) as previously hypothesized. We propose that the enzyme has evolved a network of relatively short hydrogen bonds that collectively stabilize the transition states. In particular, a short ionic hydrogen bond (SIHB) between His57 Nepsilon2 and the substrate's leaving group may promote forward progression of the TI1-to-acylenzyme reaction. We provide experimental evidence that refutes use of either a short donor-acceptor distance or a downfield 1H chemical shift as sole indicators of a LBHB.</p>

<p>DNA methylation is important in cellular, developmental and disease processes, as well as in bacterial restriction-modification systems. Methylation of DNA at the amino groups of cytosine and adenine is a common mode of protection against restriction endonucleases afforded by the bacterial methyltransferases. The first structure of an N:6-adenine methyltransferase belonging to the beta class of bacterial methyltransferases is described here. The structure of M. RSR:I from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which methylates the second adenine of the GAATTC sequence, was determined to 1.75 A resolution using X-ray crystallography. Like other methyltransferases, the enzyme contains the methylase fold and has well-defined substrate binding pockets. The catalytic core most closely resembles the PVU:II methyltransferase, a cytosine amino methyltransferase of the same beta group. The larger nucleotide binding pocket observed in M. RSR:I is expected because it methylates adenine. However, the most striking difference between the RSR:I methyltransferase and the other bacterial enzymes is the structure of the putative DNA target recognition domain, which is formed in part by two helices on an extended arm of the protein on the face of the enzyme opposite the active site. This observation suggests that a dramatic conformational change or oligomerization may take place during DNA binding and methylation.</p>

<p>Dihydroorotase (DHOase) catalyzes the reversible cyclization of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate (CA-asp) to L-dihydroorotate (DHO) in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. DHOase is a potential anti-malarial drug target as malarial parasites can only synthesize pyrimidines via the de novo pathway and do not possess a salvage pathway. Here we report the structures of Escherichia coli DHOase crystallized without ligand (1.7 A resolution) and in the presence of the inhibitors 2-oxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylate (HDDP; 2.0 A) and 5-fluoroorotate (FOA, 2.2 A). These are the first crystal structures of DHOase-inhibitor complexes, providing structural information on the mode of inhibitor binding. HDDP possesses features of both the substrate and product, and ligates the Zn atoms in the active site. In addition, HDDP forms hydrogen bonds to the flexible loop (residues 105-115) stabilizing the "loop-in" conformation of the flexible loop normally associated with the presence of CA-asp in the active site. By contrast, FOA, a product-like inhibitor, binds to the active site in a similar fashion to DHO but does not ligate the Zn atoms directly nor stabilize the loop-in conformation. These structures define the necessary features for the future design of improved inhibitors of DHOase.</p>

<p>The serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) dephosphorylates hundreds of key biological targets. PP1 associates with &gt;or=200 regulatory proteins to form highly specific holoenzymes. These regulatory proteins target PP1 to its point of action within the cell and prime its enzymatic specificity for particular substrates. However, how they direct PP1's specificity is not understood. Here we show that spinophilin, a neuronal PP1 regulator, is entirely unstructured in its unbound form, and it binds PP1 through a folding-upon-binding mechanism in an elongated fashion, blocking one of PP1's three putative substrate binding sites without altering its active site. This mode of binding is sufficient for spinophilin to restrict PP1's activity toward a model substrate in vitro without affecting its ability to dephosphorylate its neuronal substrate, glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1). Thus, our work provides the molecular basis for the ability of spinophilin to dictate PP1 substrate specificity.</p>

<p>Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate (ICT) into alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG). We report here the crystal structures of Saccharomyces cerevesiae mitochondrial NADP-IDH Idp1p in binary complexes with coenzyme NADP, or substrate ICT, or product AKG, and in a quaternary complex with NADPH, AKG, and Ca(2+), which represent different enzymatic states during the catalytic reaction. Analyses of these structures identify key residues involved in the binding of these ligands. Comparisons among these structures and with the previously reported structures of other NADP-IDHs reveal that eukaryotic NADP-IDHs undergo substantial conformational changes during the catalytic reaction. Binding or release of the ligands can cause significant conformational changes of the structural elements composing the active site, leading to rotation of the large domain relative to the small and clasp domains along two hinge regions (residues 118-124 and residues 284-287) while maintaining the integrity of its secondary structural elements, and thus, formation of at least three distinct overall conformations. Specifically, the enzyme adopts an open conformation when bound to NADP, a quasi-closed conformation when bound to ICT or AKG, and a fully closed conformation when bound to NADP, ICT, and Ca(2+) in the pseudo-Michaelis complex or with NADPH, AKG, and Ca(2+) in the product state. The conformational changes of eukaryotic NADP-IDHs are quite different from those of Escherichia coli NADP-IDH, for which significant conformational changes are observed only between two forms of the apo enzyme, suggesting that the catalytic mechanism of eukaryotic NADP-IDHs is more complex than that of EcIDH, and involves more fine-tuned conformational changes.</p>

<p>The structures of the rat cytosolic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) reported in the PEPCK-Mn2+, -Mn2+-oxaloacetic acid (OAA), -Mn2+-OAA-Mn2+-guanosine-5'-diphosphate (GDP), and -Mn2+-Mn2+-guanosine-5'-tri-phosphate (GTP) complexes provide insight into the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and decarboxylation mediated by this enzyme. OAA is observed to bind in a number of different orientations coordinating directly to the active site metal. The Mn2+-OAA and Mn2+-OAA-Mn2+GDP structures illustrate inner-sphere coordination of OAA to the manganese ion through the displacement of two of the three water molecules coordinated to the metal in the holo-enzyme by the C3 and C4 carbonyl oxygens. In the PEPCK-Mn2+-OAA complex, an alternate bound conformation of OAA is present. In this conformation, in addition to the previous interactions, the C1 carboxylate is directly coordinated to the active site Mn2+, displacing all of the waters coordinated to the metal in the holo-enzyme. In the PEPCK-Mn2+-GTP structure, the same water molecule displaced by the C1 carboxylate of OAA is displaced by one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens of the triphosphate nucleotide. The structures are consistent with a mechanism of direct in-line phosphoryl transfer, supported by the observed stereochemistry of the reaction. In the catalytically competent binding mode, the C1 carboxylate of OAA is sandwiched between R87 and R405 in an environment that would serve to facilitate decarboxylation. In the reverse reaction, these two arginines would form the CO2 binding site. Comparison of the Mn2+-OAA-Mn2+GDP and Mn2+-Mn2+GTP structures illustrates a marked difference in the bound conformations of the nucleotide substrates in which the GTP nucleotide is bound in a high-energy state resulting from the eclipsing of all three of the phosphoryl groups along the triphosphate chain. This contrasts a previously determined structure of PEPCK in complex with a triphosphate nucleotide analogue in which the analogue mirrors the conformation of GDP as opposed to GTP. Last, the structures illustrate a correlation between conformational changes in the P-loop, the nucleotide binding site, and the active site lid that are important for catalysis.</p>

<p>Protein kinase CK2 is a tetramer composed of two alpha catalytic subunits and two beta regulatory subunits. The structure of a C-terminal truncated form of the human beta subunit has been determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.7 A resolution. One dimer is observed in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The most striking feature of the structure is the presence of a zinc finger mediating the dimerization. The monomer structure consists of two domains, one entirely alpha-helical and one including the zinc finger. The dimer has a crescent shape holding a highly acidic region at both ends. We propose that this acidic region is involved in the interactions with the polyamines and/or catalytic subunits. Interestingly, conserved amino acid residues among beta subunit sequences are clustered along one linear ridge that wraps around the entire dimer. This feature suggests that protein partners may interact with the dimer through a stretch of residues in an extended conformation.</p>

In the PEPCK-Mn2+-OAA complex, an alternate bound conformation of OAA is present. In this conformation, in addition to the previous interactions, the C1 carboxylate is directly coordinated to the active site Mn2+, displacing all of the waters coordinated to the metal in the holo-enzyme. In the PEPCK-Mn2+-GTP structure, the same water molecule displaced by the C1 carboxylate of OAA is displaced by one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens of the triphosphate nucleotide. The structures are consistent with a mechanism of direct in-line phosphoryl transfer, supported by the observed stereochemistry of the reaction. In the catalytically competent binding mode, the C1 carboxylate of OAA is sandwiched between R87 and R405 in an environment that would serve to facilitate decarboxylation. In the reverse reaction, these two arginines would form the CO2 binding site. Comparison of the Mn2+-OAA-Mn2+GDP and Mn2+-Mn2+GTP structures illustrates a marked difference in the bound conformations of the nucleotide substrates in which the GTP nucleotide is bound in a high-energy state resulting from the eclipsing of all three of the phosphoryl groups along the triphosphate chain. This contrasts a previously determined structure of PEPCK in complex with a triphosphate nucleotide analogue in which the analogue mirrors the conformation of GDP as opposed to GTP. Last, the structures illustrate a correlation between conformational changes in the P-loop, the nucleotide binding site, and the active site lid that are important for catalysis.</p>

<p>Biotin-dependent multifunctional enzymes carry out metabolically important carboxyl group transfer reactions and are potential targets for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. These enzymes use a tethered biotin cofactor to carry an activated carboxyl group between distantly spaced active sites. The mechanism of this transfer has remained poorly understood. Here we report the complete structure of pyruvate carboxylase at 2.0 angstroms resolution, which shows its domain arrangement. The structure, when combined with mutagenic analysis, shows that intermediate transfer occurs between active sites on separate polypeptide chains. In addition, domain rearrangements associated with activator binding decrease the distance between active-site pairs, providing a mechanism for allosteric activation. This description provides insight into the function of biotin-dependent enzymes and presents a new paradigm for multifunctional enzyme catalysis.</p>

<p>The type II transmembrane serine protease family consists of 18 closely related serine proteases that are implicated in multiple functions. To identify selective, inhibitory antibodies against one particular type II transmembrane serine protease, matriptase [MT-SP1 (membrane-type serine protease 1)], a phage display library was created with a natural repertoire of Fabs [fragment antigen binding (Fab)] from human naïve B cells. Fab A11 was identified with a 720 pM inhibition constant and high specificity for matriptase over other trypsin-fold serine proteases. A Trichoderma reesei system expressed A11 with a yield of ∼200 mg/L. The crystal structure of A11 in complex with matriptase has been determined and compared to the crystal structure of another antibody inhibitor (S4) in complex with matriptase. Previously discovered from a synthetic single-chain variable fragment library, S4 is also a highly selective and potent matriptase inhibitor. The crystal structures of the A11/matriptase and S4/matriptase complexes were solved to 2.1 Å and 1.5 Å, respectively. Although these antibodies, discovered from separate libraries, interact differently with the protease surface loops for their specificity, the structures reveal a similar novel mechanism of protease inhibition. Through the insertion of the H3 variable loop in a reverse orientation at the substrate-binding pocket, these antibodies bury a large surface area for potent inhibition and avoid proteolytic inactivation. This discovery highlights the critical role that the antibody scaffold plays in positioning loops to bind and inhibit protease function in a highly selective manner. Additionally, Fab A11 is a fully human antibody that specifically inhibits matriptase over other closely related proteases, suggesting that this approach could be useful for clinical applications.</p>

<p>OPs (organophosphylates) exert their acute toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, by phosphylation of the catalytic serine residue. Engineering of human butyrylcholinesterase, by substitution of a histidine residue for the glycine residue at position 117, led to the creation of OP hydrolase activity. However, the lack of structural information and poor understanding of the hydrolytic mechanism of the G117H mutant has hampered further improvements in the catalytic activity. We have solved the crystallographic structure of the G117H mutant with a variety of ligands in its active site. A sulfate anion bound to the active site suggested the positioning for an OP prior to phosphylation. A fluoride anion was found in the active site when NaF was added to the crystallization buffer. In the fluoride complex, the imidazole ring from the His117 residue was substantially shifted, adopting a relaxed conformation probably close to that of the unliganded mutant enzyme. Additional X-ray structures were obtained from the transient covalent adducts formed upon reaction of the G117H mutant with the OPs echothiophate and VX [ethyl ({2-[bis(propan-2-yl)amino]ethyl}sulfanyl](methyl)phosphinate]. The position of the His117 residue shifted in response to the introduction of these adducts, overlaying the phosphylserine residue. These structural data suggest that the dephosphylation mechanism involves either a substantial conformational change of the His117 residue or an adjacent nucleophilic substitution by water.</p>

<p>The main difficulty in the development of ATP antagonist kinase inhibitors is target specificity, since the ATP-binding motif is present in many proteins. We introduce a strategy that has allowed us to identify compounds from a kinase inhibitor library that block the cyclin-dependent kinases responsible for regulating transcription, i.e., CDK7 and especially CDK9. The screening cascade employs cellular phenotypic assays based on mitotic index and nuclear p53 protein accumulation. This permitted us to classify compounds into transcriptional, cell cycle, and mitotic inhibitor groups. We describe the characterization of the transcriptional inhibitor class in terms of kinase inhibition profile, cellular mode of action, and selectivity for transformed cells. A structural selectivity rationale was used to optimize potency and biopharmaceutical properties and led to the development of a transcriptional inhibitor, 3,4-dimethyl-5-[2-(4-piperazin-1-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-3H-thiazol-2-one, with anticancer activity in animal models.</p>

<p>Structure-based design was applied to the optimization of a series of 2-(quinazolin-2-yl)phenols to generate potent and selective ATP-competitive inhibitors of the DNA damage response signaling enzyme checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2). Structure-activity relationships for multiple substituent positions were optimized separately and in combination leading to the 2-(quinazolin-2-yl)phenol 46 (IC(50) 3 nM) with good selectivity for CHK2 against CHK1 and a wider panel of kinases and with promising in vitro ADMET properties. Off-target activity at hERG ion channels shown by the core scaffold was successfully reduced by the addition of peripheral polar substitution. In addition to showing mechanistic inhibition of CHK2 in HT29 human colon cancer cells, a concentration dependent radioprotective effect in mouse thymocytes was demonstrated for the potent inhibitor 46 (CCT241533).</p>

<p>The enzyme phospholipase A2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl chain of phospholipids, forming fatty acids and lysophospholipids. The crystal structure of a triple mutant (K53,56,121M) of bovine pancreatic phospholipase A2 in which the lysine residues at positions 53, 56 and 121 are replaced recombinantly by methionines has been determined at atomic resolution (0.97 A). The crystal is monoclinic (space group P2), with unit-cell parameters a = 36.934, b = 23.863, c = 65.931 A, beta = 101.47 degrees. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and has been refined to a final R factor of 10.6% (Rfree = 13.4%) using 63,926 unique reflections. The final protein model consists of 123 amino-acid residues, two calcium ions, one chloride ion, 243 water molecules and six 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol molecules. The surface-loop residues 60-70 are ordered and have clear electron density.</p>

<p>The reduction of dehydroascorbate (DHA) to ascorbic acid (AA) is a vital cellular function. The omega-class glutathione transferases (GSTs) catalyze several reductive reactions in cellular biochemistry, including DHA reduction. In humans, two isozymes (GSTO1-1 and GSTO2-2) with significant DHA reductase (DHAR) activity are found, sharing 64% sequence identity. While the activity of GSTO2-2 is higher, it is significantly more unstable in vitro. We report the first crystal structures of human GSTO2-2, stabilized through site-directed mutagenesis and determined at 1.9 Å resolution in the presence and absence of glutathione (GSH). The structure of a human GSTO1-1 has been determined at 1.7 Å resolution in complex with the reaction product AA, which unexpectedly binds in the G-site, where the glutamyl moiety of GSH binds. The structure suggests a similar mode of ascorbate binding in GSTO2-2. This is the first time that a non-GSH-based reaction product has been observed in the G-site of any GST. AA stacks against a conserved aromatic residue, F34 (equivalent to Y34 in GSTO2-2). Mutation of Y34 to alanine in GSTO2-2 eliminates DHAR activity. From these structures and other biochemical data, we propose a mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis of DHAR activity.</p>

<p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for cellular redox reactions and can act as an important substrate in numerous biological processes. As a result, nature has evolved multiple biosynthetic pathways to meet this high chemical demand. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the NAD salvage pathway relies on the activity of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase), a member of the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) superfamily. Here, we report the structure of a eukaryotic (yeast) NAPRTase at 1.75 A resolution (locus name: YOR209C, gene name: NPT1). The structure reveals a two-domain fold that resembles the architecture of quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferases (QAPRTases), but with completely different dispositions that provide evidence for structural heterogeneity among the Type II PRTases. The identification of a third domain in NAPRTases provides a structural basis and possible mechanism for the functional modulation of this family of enzymes by ATP.</p>

<p>Chiral amines are important building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceutical products, fine chemicals, and agrochemicals. ω-Transaminases are able to directly synthesize enantiopure chiral amines by catalysing the transfer of an amino group from a primary amino donor to a carbonyl acceptor with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) as cofactor. In nature, (S)-selective amine transaminases are more abundant than the (R)-selective enzymes, and therefore more information concerning their structures is available. Here, we present the crystal structure of an (R)-ω-transaminase from Aspergillus terreus determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.6 Å. The structure of the protein is a homodimer that displays the typical class IV fold of PLP-dependent aminotransferases. The PLP-cofactor observed in the structure is present in two states (i) covalently bound to the active site lysine (the internal aldimine form) and (ii) as substrate/product adduct (the external aldimine form) and free lysine. Docking studies revealed that (R)-transaminases follow a dual binding mode, in which the large binding pocket can harbour the bulky substituent of the amine or ketone substrate and the α-carboxylate of pyruvate or amino acids, and the small binding pocket accommodates the smaller substituent. </p>

<p>Here we describe a systematic structure-function analysis of the human ubiquitin (Ub) E2 conjugating proteins, consisting of the determination of 15 new high-resolution three-dimensional structures of E2 catalytic domains, and autoubiquitylation assays for 26 Ub-loading E2s screened against a panel of nine different HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) E3 ligase domains. Integration of our structural and biochemical data revealed several E2 surface properties associated with Ub chain building activity; (1) net positive or neutral E2 charge, (2) an "acidic trough" located near the catalytic Cys, surrounded by an extensive basic region, and (3) similarity to the previously described HECT binding signature in UBE2L3 (UbcH7). Mass spectrometry was used to characterize the autoubiquitylation products of a number of functional E2-HECT pairs, and demonstrated that HECT domains from different subfamilies catalyze the formation of very different types of Ub chains, largely independent of the E2 in the reaction. Our data set represents the first comprehensive analysis of E2-HECT E3 interactions, and thus provides a framework for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitylation.</p>

<p>Tremendous gains and novel methods are often developed when people are challenged to do something new or difficult. This process is enhanced when people compete against each other-this can be seen in sport as well as in science and technology (e.g. the space race). The SAMPL challenges, like the CASP challenges, aim to challenge modellers and software developers to develop new ways of looking at molecular interactions so the community as a whole can progress in the accurate prediction of these interactions. In order for this challenge to occur, data must be supplied so the prospective test can be done. We have supplied unpublished data related to a drug discovery program run several years ago on HIV integrase for the SAMPL4 challenge. This paper describes the methods used to obtain these data and the chemistry involved.</p>

<p>Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a family of enzymes that modulate the immune response, inflammation, and memory, among many other functions. There are three types of PDEs: cAMP-specific, cGMP-specific, and dual-specific. Here we describe the mechanism of nucleotide selectivity on the basis of high-resolution co-crystal structures of the cAMP-specific PDE4B and PDE4D with AMP, the cGMP-specific PDE5A with GMP, and the apo-structure of the dual-specific PDE1B. These structures show that an invariant glutamine functions as the key specificity determinant by a "glutamine switch" mechanism for recognizing the purine moiety in cAMP or cGMP. The surrounding residues anchor the glutamine residue in different orientations for cAMP and for cGMP. The PDE1B structure shows that in dual-specific PDEs a key histidine residue may enable the invariant glutamine to toggle between cAMP and cGMP. The structural understanding of nucleotide binding enables the design of new PDE inhibitors that may treat diseases in which cyclic nucleotides play a critical role.</p>

<p>An atomic model of the tetrameric surface glycoprotein neuraminidase of influenza virus A/Tokyo/3/67 has been built and refined based on X-ray diffraction data at 2.2 A resolution. The crystallographic residual is 0.21 for data between 6 and 2.2 A resolution and the r.m.s. deviations from ideal geometry are 0.02 A for bond lengths and 3.9 degrees for bond angles. The model includes amino acid residues 83 to 469, four oligosaccharide structures N-linked at asparagine residues 86, 146, 200 and 234, a single putative Ca2+ ion site, and 85 water molecules. One of the oligosaccharides participates in a novel crystal contact. The folding pattern is a beta-sheet propeller as described earlier and details of the intramolecular interactions between the six beta-sheets are presented. Strain-invariant residues are clustered around the propeller axis on the upper surface of the molecule where they line the wall of a cavity into which sialic has been observed to bind. Strain-variable residues implicated in binding to antibodies surround this site.</p>

<p>Saquinavir (SQV), the first antiviral HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitor approved for AIDS therapy, has been studied in complexes with PR and the variants PR(I) (84V) and PR(V) (82A) containing the single mutations I84V and V82A that provide resistance to all the clinical inhibitors. Atomic resolution crystal structures (0.97-1.25 A) of the SQV complexes were analyzed in comparison to the protease complexes with darunavir, a new drug that targets resistant HIV, in order to understand the molecular basis of drug resistance. PR(I) (84V) and PR(V) (82A) complexes were obtained in both the space groups P2(1)2(1)2 and P2(1)2(1)2(1), which provided experimental limits for the conformational flexibility. The SQV interactions with PR were very similar in the mutant complexes, consistent with the similar inhibition constants. The mutation from bigger to smaller amino acids allows more space to accommodate the large group at P1' of SQV, unlike the reduced interactions observed in darunavir complexes. The residues 79-82 have adjusted to accommodate the large hydrophobic groups of SQV, suggesting that these residues are intrinsically flexible and their conformation depends more on the nature of the inhibitor than on the mutations in this region. This analysis will assist with development of more effective antiviral inhibitors.</p>

<p>Catalase-1, one of four catalase activities of Neurospora crassa, is associated with non-growing cells and accumulates in asexual spores. It is a large, tetrameric, highly efficient, and durable enzyme that is active even at molar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Catalase-1 is oxidized at the heme by singlet oxygen without significant effects on enzyme activity. Here we present the crystal structure of catalase-1 at 1.75A resolution. Compared to structures of other catalases of the large class, the main differences were found at the carboxy-terminal domain. The heme group is rotated 180 degrees around the alpha-gamma-meso carbon axis with respect to clade 3 small catalases. There is no co-ordination bond of the ferric ion at the heme distal side in catalase-1. The catalase-1 structure exhibited partial oxidation of heme b to heme d. Singlet oxygen, produced catalytically or by photosensitization, may hydroxylate C5 and C6 of pyrrole ring III with a subsequent formation of a gamma-spirolactone in C6. The modification site in catalases depends on the way dioxygen exits the protein: mainly through the central channel or the main channel in large and small catalases, respectively. The catalase-1 structure revealed an unusual covalent bond between a cysteine sulphur atom and the essential tyrosine residue of the proximal side of the active site. A peptide with the predicted theoretical mass of the two bound tryptic peptides was detected by mass spectrometry. A mechanism for the Cys-Tyr covalent bond formation is proposed. The tyrosine bound to the cysteine residue would be less prone to donate electrons to compound I to form compound II, explaining catalase-1 resistance to substrate inhibition and inactivation. An apparent constriction of the main channel at Ser198 lead us to propose a gate that opens the narrow part of the channel when there is sufficient hydrogen peroxide in the small cavity before the gate. This mechanism would explain the increase in catalytic velocity as the hydrogen peroxide concentration rises.</p>

<p>Many candidate unnatural DNA base pairs have been developed, but some of the best-replicated pairs adopt intercalated structures in free DNA that are difficult to reconcile with known mechanisms of polymerase recognition. Here we present crystal structures of KlenTaq DNA polymerase at different stages of replication for one such pair, dNaM-d5SICS, and show that efficient replication results from the polymerase itself, inducing the required natural-like structure.</p>

<p>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step in methane biogenesis: the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (methyl-SCoM) by coenzyme B (CoBSH) to methane and a heterodisulfide (CoBS-SCoM). Crystallographic studies show that the active site is deeply buried within the enzyme and contains a highly reduced nickel-tetrapyrrole, coenzyme F(430). Methyl-SCoM must enter the active site prior to CoBSH, as species derived from methyl-SCoM are always observed bound to the F(430) nickel in the deepest part of the 30 A long substrate channel that leads from the protein surface to the active site. The seven-carbon mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoBSH binds within a 16 A predominantly hydrophobic part of the channel close to F(430), with the CoBSH thiolate lying closest to the nickel at a distance of 8.8 A. It has previously been suggested that binding of CoBSH initiates catalysis by inducing a conformational change that moves methyl-SCoM closer to the nickel promoting cleavage of the C-S bond of methyl-SCoM. In order to better understand the structural role of CoBSH early in the MCR mechanism, we have determined crystal structures of MCR in complex with four different CoBSH analogues: pentanoyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, and nonanoyl derivatives of CoBSH (CoB(5)SH, CoB(6)SH, CoB(8)SH, and CoB(9)SH, respectively). The data presented here reveal that the shorter CoB(5)SH mercaptoalkanoyl chain overlays with that of CoBSH but terminates two units short of the CoBSH thiolate position. In contrast, the mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoB(6)SH adopts a different conformation, such that its thiolate is coincident with the position of the CoBSH thiolate. This is consistent with the observation that CoB(6)SH is a slow substrate. A labile water in the substrate channel was found to be a sensitive indicator for the presence of CoBSH and HSCoM. The longer CoB(8)SH and CoB(9)SH analogues can be accommodated in the active site through exclusion of this water. These analogues react with Ni(III)-methyl, a proposed MCR catalytic intermediate of methanogenesis. The CoB(8)SH thiolate is 2.6 A closer to the nickel than that of CoBSH, but the additional carbon of CoB(9)SH only decreases the nickel thiolate distance a further 0.3 A. Although the analogues do not induce any structural changes in the substrate channel, the thiolates appear to preferentially bind at two distinct positions in the channel, one being the previously observed CoBSH thiolate position and the other being at a hydrophobic annulus of residues that lines the channel proximal to the nickel.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) mistletoe lectin I (ML-I) from Viscum album in complex with adenine has been refined to 1.9 A resolution. High quality crystals of the ML-I complex were obtained by the method of vapour diffusion using the high density protein crystal growth system (HDPCG) on the international space station, mission ISS 6A. Hexagonal crystals were grown during three months under microgravity conditions. Diffraction data to 1.9A were collected applying synchrotron radiation and cryo- techniques. The structure was refined subsequently to analyse the structure of ML-I and particularly the active site conformation, complexed by adenine that mimics the RNA substrate binding.</p>

<p>Protein kinases play key roles in signal transduction and therefore are among the most attractive targets for drug design. The pharmacological aptitude of protein kinase inhibitors is highlighted by the observation that various diseases with special reference to cancer are because of the abnormal expression/activity of individual kinases. The resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the target kinase in complex with inhibitors is often the starting point for the rational design of this kind of drugs, some of which are already in advanced clinical trial or even in clinical practice. Here we present and discuss three new crystal structures of ATP site-directed inhibitors in complex with "casein kinase-2" (CK2), a constitutively active protein kinase implicated in a variety of cellular functions and misfunctions. With the help of theoretical calculations, we disclose some key features underlying the inhibitory efficiency of anthraquinone derivatives, outlining three different binding modes into the active site. In particular, we show that a nitro group in a hydroxyanthraquinone scaffold decreases the inhibitory constants K(i) because of electron-withdrawing and resonance effects that enhance the polarization of hydroxylic substituents in paraposition.</p>

<p>Long-chain mannitol dehydrogenases are secondary alcohol dehydrogenases that are of wide interest because of their involvement in metabolism and potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. They differ from other alcohol and polyol dehydrogenases because they do not contain a conserved tyrosine and are not dependent on Zn(2+) or other metal cofactors. The structures of the long-chain mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (54 kDa) from Pseudomonas fluorescens in a binary complex with NAD(+) and ternary complex with NAD(+) and d-mannitol have been determined to resolutions of 1.7 and 1.8 A and R-factors of 0.171 and 0.176, respectively. These results show an N-terminal domain that includes a typical Rossmann fold. The C-terminal domain is primarily alpha-helical and mediates mannitol binding. The electron lone pair of Lys-295 is steered by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the amide oxygen of Asn-300 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Val-229 to act as the general base. Asn-191 and Asn-300 are involved in a web of hydrogen bonding, which precisely orients the mannitol O2 proton for abstraction. These residues also aid in stabilizing a negative charge in the intermediate state and in preventing the formation of nonproductive complexes with the substrate. The catalytic lysine may be returned to its unprotonated state using a rectifying proton tunnel driven by Glu-292 oscillating among different environments. Despite low sequence homology, the closest structural neighbors are glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, N-(1-d-carboxylethyl)-l-norvaline dehydrogenase, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, indicating a possible evolutionary relationship among these enzymes.</p>

The seven-carbon mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoBSH binds within a 16 A predominantly hydrophobic part of the channel close to F(430), with the CoBSH thiolate lying closest to the nickel at a distance of 8.8 A. It has previously been suggested that binding of CoBSH initiates catalysis by inducing a conformational change that moves methyl-SCoM closer to the nickel promoting cleavage of the C-S bond of methyl-SCoM. In order to better understand the structural role of CoBSH early in the MCR mechanism, we have determined crystal structures of MCR in complex with four different CoBSH analogues: pentanoyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, and nonanoyl derivatives of CoBSH (CoB(5)SH, CoB(6)SH, CoB(8)SH, and CoB(9)SH, respectively). The data presented here reveal that the shorter CoB(5)SH mercaptoalkanoyl chain overlays with that of CoBSH but terminates two units short of the CoBSH thiolate position. In contrast, the mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoB(6)SH adopts a different conformation, such that its thiolate is coincident with the position of the CoBSH thiolate. This is consistent with the observation that CoB(6)SH is a slow substrate. A labile water in the substrate channel was found to be a sensitive indicator for the presence of CoBSH and HSCoM. The longer CoB(8)SH and CoB(9)SH analogues can be accommodated in the active site through exclusion of this water. These analogues react with Ni(III)-methyl, a proposed MCR catalytic intermediate of methanogenesis. The CoB(8)SH thiolate is 2.6 A closer to the nickel than that of CoBSH, but the additional carbon of CoB(9)SH only decreases the nickel thiolate distance a further 0.3 A. Although the analogues do not induce any structural changes in the substrate channel, the thiolates appear to preferentially bind at two distinct positions in the channel, one being the previously observed CoBSH thiolate position and the other being at a hydrophobic annulus of residues that lines the channel proximal to the nickel.</p>

<p>The potent new antiviral inhibitor GRL-98065 (1) of HIV-1 protease (PR) has been studied with PR variants containing the single mutations D30N, I50V, V82A, and I84V that provide resistance to the major clinical inhibitors. Compound 1 had inhibition constants of 17-fold, 8-fold, 3-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, for PR(D30N), PR(I50V), PR(V82A), and PR(I84V) relative to wild type PR. The chemically related darunavir had similar relative inhibition, except for PR(D30N), where inhibitor 1 was approximately 3-fold less potent. The high resolution (1.11-1.60 Angstrom) crystal structures of PR mutant complexes with inhibitor 1 showed small changes relative to the wild type enzyme. PR(D30N) and PR(V82A) showed compensating interactions with inhibitor 1 relative to those of PR, while reduced hydrophobic contacts were observed with PR(I50V) and PR(I84V). Importantly, inhibitor 1 complexes showed fewer changes relative to wild type enzyme than reported for darunavir complexes. Therefore, inhibitor 1 is a valuable addition to the antiviral inhibitors with high potency against resistant strains of HIV.</p>

<p>The human mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotidase catalyzes the dephosphorylation of thymidine and deoxyuridine monophosphates and participates in the regulation of the dTTP pool in mitochondria. We present seven structures of the inactive D41N variant of this enzyme in complex with thymidine 3'-monophosphate, thymidine 5'-monophosphate, deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate, uridine 5'-monophosphate, deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate, uridine 2'-monophosphate, and the 5'-monophosphate of the nucleoside analog 3'-deoxy 2'3'-didehydrothymidine, and we draw conclusions about the substrate specificity based on comparisons with enzyme activities. We show that the enzyme's specificity for the deoxyribo form of nucleoside 5'-monophosphates is due to Ile-133, Phe-49, and Phe-102, which surround the 2' position of the sugar and cause an energetically unfavorable environment for the 2'-hydroxyl group of ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates. The close binding of the 3'-hydroxyl group of nucleoside 5'-monophosphates to the enzyme indicates that nucleoside analog drugs that are substituted with a bulky group at this position will not be good substrates for this enzyme.</p>

<p>Computational design is a test of our understanding of enzyme catalysis and a means of engineering novel, tailor-made enzymes. While the de novo computational design of catalytically efficient enzymes remains a challenge, designed enzymes may comprise unique starting points for further optimization by directed evolution. Directed evolution of two computationally designed Kemp eliminases, KE07 and KE70, led to low to moderately efficient enzymes (k(cat)/K(m) values of ≤ 5 10(4) M(-1)s(-1)). Here we describe the optimization of a third design, KE59. Although KE59 was the most catalytically efficient Kemp eliminase from this design series (by k(cat)/K(m), and by catalyzing the elimination of nonactivated benzisoxazoles), its impaired stability prevented its evolutionary optimization. To boost KE59's evolvability, stabilizing consensus mutations were included in the libraries throughout the directed evolution process. The libraries were also screened with less activated substrates. Sixteen rounds of mutation and selection led to &gt; 2,000-fold increase in catalytic efficiency, mainly via higher k(cat) values. The best KE59 variants exhibited k(cat)/K(m) values up to 0.6 10(6) M(-1)s(-1), and k(cat)/k(uncat) values of ≤ 10(7) almost regardless of substrate reactivity. Biochemical, structural, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies provided insights regarding the optimization of KE59. Overall, the directed evolution of three different designed Kemp eliminases, KE07, KE70, and KE59, demonstrates that computational designs are highly evolvable and can be optimized to high catalytic efficiencies.</p>

<p>Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is generated by natural and anthropogenic processes and has a critical role in environmental chemistry. It has an ozone-depleting potential similar to that of hydrochlorofluorocarbons as well as a global warming potential exceeding that of CO(2) 300-fold. In bacterial denitrification, N(2)O is reduced to N(2) by the copper-dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N(2)OR). This enzyme carries the mixed-valent Cu(A) centre and the unique, tetranuclear Cu(Z) site. Previous structural data were obtained with enzyme isolated in the presence of air that is catalytically inactive without prior reduction. Its Cu(Z) site was described as a [4Cu:S] centre, and the substrate-binding mode and reduction mechanism remained elusive. Here we report the structure of purple N(2)OR from Pseudomonas stutzeri, handled under the exclusion of dioxygen, and locate the substrate in N(2)O-pressurized crystals. The active Cu(Z) cluster contains two sulphur atoms, yielding a [4Cu:2S] stoichiometry; and N(2)O bound side-on at Cu(Z), in close proximity to Cu(A). With the substrate located between the two clusters, electrons are transferred directly from Cu(A) to N(2)O, which is activated by side-on binding in a specific binding pocket on the face of the [4Cu:2S] centre. These results reconcile a multitude of available biochemical data on N(2)OR that could not be explained by earlier structures, and outline a mechanistic pathway in which both metal centres and the intervening protein act in concert to achieve catalysis. This structure represents the first direct observation, to our knowledge, of N(2)O bound to its reductase, and sheds light on the functionality of metalloenzymes that activate inert small-molecule substrates. The principle of using distinct clusters for substrate activation and for reduction may be relevant for similar systems, in particular nitrogen-fixing nitrogenase.</p>

<p>The bacterial aminopeptidase isolated from the extracellular extract of Streptomyces griseus (SGAP) is a double-zinc exopeptidase with a high preference for large hydrophobic amino-terminus residues. It is a monomer of a relatively low molecular weight (30 kDa), is heat-stable, displays a high and efficient catalytic turnover and its activity is modulated by calcium ions. Several free amino acids were found to inhibit the activity of SGAP in the millimolar concentration range and can therefore serve for the study of binding of both inhibitors and reaction products. The current study is focused on the X-ray crystallographic analysis of the SGAP complexes with L-tryptophan and p-iodo-L-phenylalanine, both at 1.30 A resolution. These two bulky inhibitory amino acids were found to bind to the active site of SGAP in very similar positions and orientations. Both of them bind to the two active-site zinc ions via their free carboxylate group, while displacing the zinc-bound water/hydroxide that is present in the native enzyme. Further stabilization of the binding of the amino-acid carboxylate group is achieved by its relatively strong interactions with the hydroxyl group of Tyr246 and the carboxylate group of Glu131. The binding is also stabilized by three specific hydrogen bonds between the amine group of the bound amino acid and enzyme residues Glu131, Asp160 and Arg202. These consistent interactions confirm the key role of these residues in the specific binding of the free amine of substrates and products, as proposed previously. The phenyl ring of Phe219 of the enzyme is involved in stacking interactions with the corresponding aromatic ring of the bound affector. This interaction seems to be important for the binding and orientation of the aromatic side chain within the specificity pocket. These structural results correlate well with the results obtained for the complexes of SGAP with other inhibitory amino acids and support the general catalytic mechanism proposed for this and related enzymes.</p>

<p>Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is a ubiquitous algal metabolite and common carbon and sulfur source for marine bacteria. DMSP is a precursor for the climatically active gas dimethylsulfide that is readily oxidized to sulfate, sulfur dioxide, methanesulfonic acid, and other products that act as cloud condensation nuclei. Although the environmental importance of DMSP metabolism has been known for some time, the enzyme responsible for DMSP demethylation by marine bacterioplankton, dimethylsufoniopropionate-dependent demethylase A (DmdA, EC 2.1.1.B5), has only recently been identified and biochemically characterized. In this work, we report the structure for the apoenzyme DmdA from Pelagibacter ubique (2.1 Å), as well as for DmdA co-crystals soaked with substrate DMSP (1.6 Å) or the cofactor tetrahydrofolate (THF) (1.6 Å). Surprisingly, the overall fold of the DmdA is not similar to other enzymes that typically utilize the reduced form of THF and in fact is a triple domain structure similar to what has been observed for the glycine cleavage T protein or sarcosine oxidase. Specifically, while the THF binding fold appears conserved, previous biochemical studies have shown that all enzymes with a similar fold produce 5,10-methylene-THF, while DmdA catalyzes a redox-neutral methyl transfer reaction to produce 5-methyl-THF. On the basis of the findings presented herein and the available biochemical data, we outline a mechanism for a redox-neutral methyl transfer reaction that is novel to this conserved THF binding domain.</p>

<p>GES-1 is a class A extended-spectrum β-lactamase conferring resistance to penicillins, narrow- and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, and ceftazidime. However, GES-1 poorly hydrolyzes aztreonam and cephamycins and exhibits very low k(cat) values for carbapenems. Twenty-two GES variants have been discovered thus far, differing from each other by 1 to 3 amino acid substitutions that affect substrate specificity. GES-11 possesses a Gly243Ala substitution which seems to confer to this variant an increased activity against aztreonam and ceftazidime. GES-12 differs from GES-11 by a single Thr237Ala substitution, while GES-14 differs from GES-11 by the Gly170Ser mutation, which is known to confer increased carbapenemase activity. GES-11 and GES-12 were kinetically characterized and compared to GES-1 and GES-14. Purified GES-11 and GES-12 showed strong activities against most tested β-lactams, with the exception of temocillin, cefoxitin, and carbapenems. Both variants showed a significantly increased rate of hydrolysis of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. On the other hand, GES-11 and GES-12 (and GES-14) variants all containing Ala243 exhibited increased susceptibility to classical inhibitors. The crystallographic structures of the GES-11 and GES-14 β-lactamases were solved. The overall structures of GES-11 and GES-14 are similar to that of GES-1. The Gly243Ala substitution caused only subtle local rearrangements, notably in the typical carbapenemase disulfide bond. The active sites of GES-14 and GES-11 are very similar, with the Gly170Ser substitution leading only to the formation of additional hydrogen bonds of the Ser residue with hydrolytic water and the Glu166 residue.</p>

<p>The main channel for H(2)O(2) access to the heme cavity in large subunit catalases is twice as long as in small subunit catalases and is divided into two distinct parts. Like small subunit catalases, the 15Å of the channel adjacent to the heme has a predominantly hydrophobic surface with only weak water occupancy, but the next 15Å extending to the protein surface is hydrophilic and contains a complex water matrix in multiple passages. At the approximate junction of these two sections are a conserved serine and glutamate that are hydrogen bonded and associated with H(2)O(2) in inactive variants. Mutation of these residues changed the dimensions of the channel, both enlarging and constricting it, and also changed the solvent occupancy in the hydrophobic, inner section of the main channel. Despite these structural changes and the prominent location of the residues in the channel, the variants exhibited less than a 2-fold change in the k(cat) and apparent K(M) kinetic constants. These results reflect the importance of the complex multi-passage structure of the main channel. Surprisingly, mutation of either the serine or glutamate to an aliphatic side chain interfered with heme oxidation to heme d.</p>

<p>Kae1 is a universally conserved ATPase and part of the essential gene set in bacteria. In archaea and eukaryotes, Kae1 is embedded within the protein kinase-containing KEOPS complex. Mutation of KEOPS subunits in yeast leads to striking telomere and transcription defects, but the exact biochemical function of KEOPS is not known. As a first step to elucidating its function, we solved the atomic structure of archaea-derived KEOPS complexes involving Kae1, Bud32, Pcc1, and Cgi121 subunits. Our studies suggest that Kae1 is regulated at two levels by the primordial protein kinase Bud32, which is itself regulated by Cgi121. Moreover, Pcc1 appears to function as a dimerization module, perhaps suggesting that KEOPS may be a processive molecular machine. Lastly, as Bud32 lacks the conventional substrate-recognition infrastructure of eukaryotic protein kinases including an activation segment, Bud32 may provide a glimpse of the evolutionary history of the protein kinase family.</p>

<p>The serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 is emerging as a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Much attention has recently been focused on identifying potential Pim-1 inhibitor candidates for the treatment of haematopoietic malignancies. The outcome of a rational drug-design project has recently been reported [Nakano et al. (2012), J. Med. Chem. 55, 5151-5156]. The report described the process of optimization of the structure-activity relationship and detailed from a medicinal chemistry perspective the development of a low-potency and nonselective compound initially identified from in silico screening into a potent, selective and metabolically stable Pim-1 inhibitor. Here, the structures of the initial in silico hits are reported and the noteworthy features of the Pim-1 complex structures are described. A particular focus was placed on the rearrangement of the glycine-rich P-loop region that was observed for one of the initial compounds, (Z)-7-(azepan-1-ylmethyl)-2-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methylidene]-6-hydroxy-1-benzofuran-3(2H)-one (compound 1), and was also found in all further derivatives. This novel P-loop conformation, which appears to be stabilized by an additional interaction with the β3 strand located above the binding site, is not usually observed in Pim-1 structures.</p>

<p>Several drugs and natural compounds are known to be highly neurotoxic, triggering epileptic convulsions or seizures, and causing headaches, agitations, as well as other neuronal symptoms. The neurotoxic effects of some of these compounds, including theophylline and ginkgotoxin, have been traced to their inhibitory activity against human pyridoxal kinase (hPL kinase), resulting in deficiency of the active cofactor form of vitamin B₆, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Pyridoxal (PL), an inactive form of vitamin B₆ is converted to PLP by PL kinase. PLP is the B₆ vitamer required as a cofactor for over 160 enzymatic activities essential in primary and secondary metabolism. We have performed structural and kinetic studies on hPL kinase with several potential inhibitors, including ginkgotoxin and theophylline. The structural studies show ginkgotoxin and theophylline bound at the substrate site, and are involved in similar protein interactions as the natural substrate, PL. Interestingly, the phosphorylated product of ginkgotoxin is also observed bound at the active site. This work provides insights into the molecular basis of hPL kinase inhibition and may provide a working hypothesis to quickly screen or identify neurotoxic drugs as potential hPL kinase inhibitors. Such adverse effects may be prevented by administration of an appropriate form of vitamin B₆, or provide clues of how to modify these drugs to help reduce their hPL kinase inhibitory effects.</p>

<p>We report herein the functional expression of an Fe-type nitrile hydratase (NHase) without the co-expression of an activator protein or the Escherichia coli chaperone proteins GroES/EL. Soluble protein was obtained when the α- and β-subunit genes of the Fe-type NHase Comamonas testosteroni Ni1 (CtNHase) were synthesized with optimized E. coli codon usage and co-expressed. As a control, the Fe-type NHase from Rhodococcus equi TG328-2 (ReNHase) was expressed with (ReNHase(+Act)) and without (ReNHase(-Act)) its activator protein, establishing that expression of a fully functional, metallated ReNHase enzyme requires the co-expression of its activator protein, similar to all other Fe-type NHase enzymes reported to date, whereas the CtNHase does not. The X-ray crystal structure of CtNHase was determined to 2.4Å resolution revealing an αβ heterodimer, similar to other Fe-type NHase enzymes, except for two important differences. First, two His residues reside in the CtNHase active site that are not observed in other Fe-type NHase enzymes and second, the active site Fe(III) ion resides at the bottom of a wide solvent exposed channel. The solvent exposed active site, along with the two active site histidine residues, are hypothesized to play a role in iron incorporation in the absence of an activator protein.</p>

<p>Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), the causative agent of infectious anemia in horses, is a member of the lentiviral family. The virus-encoded proteinase (PR) processes viral polyproteins into functional molecules during replication and it also cleaves viral nucleocapsid protein during infection. The X-ray structure of a complex of the 154G mutant of EIAV PR with the inhibitor HBY-793 was solved at 1.8 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.136. The molecule is a dimer in which the monomers are related by a crystallographic twofold axis. Although both the enzyme and the inhibitor are symmetric, the interactions between the central part of the inhibitor and the active site aspartates are asymmetric, and the inhibitor and the two flaps are partially disordered. The overall fold of EIAV PR is very similar to that of other retroviral proteinases. However, a novel feature of the EIAV PR structure is the appearance of the second alpha-helix in the monomer in a position predicted by the structural template for the family of aspartic proteinases. The parts of the EIAV PR with the highest resemblance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 PR include the substrate-binding sites; thus, the differences in the specificity of both enzymes have to be explained by enzyme-ligand interactions at the periphery of the active site as well.</p>

<p>Snapshots of three consecutive steps in the proteolytic reaction of HIV-1 protease (PR) were obtained in crystal structures at resolutions of 1.2-1.4 Å. Structures of wild-type protease and two mutants (PR(V32I) and PR(I47V)) with V32I and I47V substitutions, which are common in drug resistance, reveal the gem-diol tetrahedral intermediate, the separating N- and C-terminal products, and the C-terminal product of an autoproteolytic peptide. These structures represent three stages in the reaction pathway and shed light on the reaction mechanism. The near-atomic-resolution geometric details include a short hydrogen bond between the intermediate and the outer carboxylate oxygen of one catalytic Asp25 that is conserved in all three structures. The two products in the complex with mutant PR(I47V) have a 2.2 Å separation of the amide and carboxyl carbon of the adjacent ends, suggesting partial cleavage prior to product release. The complex of mutant PR(V32I) with a single C-terminal product shows density for water molecules in the other half of the binding site, including a partial occupancy water molecule interacting with the product carboxylate end and the carbonyl oxygen of one conformation of Gly27, which suggests a potential role of Gly27 in recycling from the product complex to the ligand-free enzyme. These structural details at near-atomic resolution enhance our understanding of the reaction pathway and will assist in the design of mechanism-based inhibitors as antiviral agents.</p>

<p>One of the major problems encountered in antiviral therapy against AIDS is the emergence of viral variants that exhibit drug resistance. The sequences of proteases (PRs) from related retroviruses sometimes include, at structurally equivalent positions, amino acids identical to those found in drug-resistant forms of HIV-1 PR. The statine-based inhibitor LP-130 was found to be a universal, nanomolar-range inhibitor against all tested retroviral PRs. We solved the crystal structures of LP-130 in complex with retroviral PRs from HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus, and equine infectious anemia virus and compared the structures to determine the differences in the interactions between the inhibitor and the active-site residues of the enzymes. This comparison shows an extraordinary similarity in the binding modes of the inhibitor molecules. The only exceptions are the different conformations of naphthylalanine side chains at the P3/P3' positions, which might be responsible for the variation in the Ki values. These findings indicate that successful inhibition of different retroviral PRs by LP-130 is achieved because this compound can be accommodated without serious conformational differences, despite the variations in the type of residues forming the active-site region. Although strong, specific interactions between the ligand and the enzyme might improve the potency of the inhibitor, the absence of such interactions seems to favor the universality of the compound. Hence, the ability of potential anti-AIDS drugs to inhibit multiple retroviral PRs might indicate their likelihood of not eliciting drug resistance. These studies may also contribute to the development of a small-animal model for preclinical testing of antiviral compounds.</p>

<p>In human methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) the Ala222Val (677C--&gt;T) polymorphism encodes a heat-labile gene product that is associated with elevated levels of homocysteine and possibly with risk for cardiovascular disease. Generation of the equivalent Ala to Val mutation in Escherichia coli MTHFR, which is 30% identical to the catalytic domain of the human enzyme, creates a protein with enhanced thermolability. In both human and E. coli MTHFR, the A --&gt; V mutation increases the rate of dissociation of FAD, and in both enzymes, loss of FAD is linked to changes in quaternary structure [Yamada, K., Chen, Z., Rozen, R., and Matthews, R. G. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 14853-14858; Guenther, B. D., Sheppard, C. A., Tran, P., Rozen, R., Matthews, R. G., and Ludwig, M. L. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 359-365]. Folates have been shown to protect both human and bacterial enzymes from loss of FAD. Despite its effect on affinity for FAD, the A --&gt; V mutation is located at the bottom of the (betaalpha)(8) barrel of the catalytic domain in a position that does not contact the bound FAD prosthetic group. Here we report the structures of the Ala177Val mutant of E. coli MTHFR and of its complex with the 5,10-dideazafolate analogue, LY309887, and suggest mechanisms by which the mutation may perturb FAD binding. Helix alpha5, which immediately precedes the loop bearing the mutation, carries several residues that interact with FAD, including Asn168, Arg171, and Lys172. In the structures of the mutant enzyme this helix is displaced, perturbing protein-FAD interactions. In the complex with LY309887, the pterin-like ring of the analogue stacks against the si face of the flavin and is secured by hydrogen bonds to residues Gln183 and Asp120 that adjoin this face. The direct interactions of bound folate with the cofactor provide one mechanism for linkage between binding of FAD and folate binding that could account in part for the protective action of folates. Conformation changes induced by folate binding may also suppress dissociation of FAD.</p>

<p>We have determined steady-state rate constants and net rate constants for the chemical steps in the catalytic pathway catalyzed by the E370D mutant of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and compared them with those of the wild-type dehydrogenase. We sought rationales for changes in these rate constants in the structure of the mutant cocrystallized with the alternate substrate, 4-nitrobutyric acid. Substitution of aspartate for E370, the catalytic base, results in a 24% decrease in the rate constant for proton abstraction at C-2 of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA as the distance between C-2 of the ligand and the closest carboxyl oxygen at residue 370 increases from 2.9 A to 3.1 A. The net rate constant for flavin reduction due to hydride transfer from C-3 of the natural substrate, which includes proton abstraction at C-2, to N5 of the flavin decreases by 81% due to the mutation, although the distance increases only by 0.7 A. The intensities of charge-transfer bands associated with the enolate of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, the reductive half-reaction (reduced flavin with oxidized form of substrate), and the dienolate following decarboxylation are considerably diminished. Structural investigation suggests that the increased distance and the change in angle of the S-C1(=O)-C2 plane of the substrate with the isoalloxazine substantially alter rates of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions. This change in active site geometry also changes the position of protonation of the four carbon dienolate intermediate to produce kinetically favorable product, vinylacetyl-CoA, which is further isomerized to the thermodynamically stable normal product, crotonyl-CoA.</p>

<p>Metabolism of D-amino acids is of considerable interest due to their key importance in cell structure and function. Salmonella typhimuriumd-serine deaminase (StDSD) is a pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme that catalyses degradation of D-Ser to pyruvate and ammonia. The first crystal structure of d-serine deaminase described here reveals a typical Foldtype II or tryptophan synthase β subunit fold of PLP-dependent enzymes. Although holoenzyme was used for crystallization of both wild-type StDSD (WtDSD) and selenomethionine labelled StDSD (SeMetDSD), significant electron density was not observed for the cofactor, indicating that the enzyme has a low affinity for the cofactor under crystallization conditions. Interestingly, unexpected conformational differences were observed between the two structures. The WtDSD was in an open conformation while SeMetDSD, crystallized in the presence of isoserine, was in a closed conformation suggesting that the enzyme is likely to undergo conformational changes upon binding of substrate as observed in other Foldtype II PLP-dependent enzymes. Electron density corresponding to a plausible sodium ion was found near the active site of the closed but not in the open state of the enzyme. Examination of the active site and substrate modelling suggests that Thr166 may be involved in abstraction of proton from the Cα atom of the substrate. Apart from the physiological reaction, StDSD catalyses α, β elimination of D-Thr, D-Allothr and L-Ser to the corresponding α-keto acids and ammonia. The structure of StDSD provides a molecular framework necessary for understanding differences in the rate of reaction with these substrates.</p>

<p>The interactions of RNase A with cytidine 3'-monophosphate (3'-CMP) and deoxycytidyl-3',5'-deoxyadenosine (d(CpA)) were analyzed by X-ray crystallography. The 3'-CMP complex and the native structure were determined from trigonal crystals, and the d(CpA) complex from monoclinic crystals. The differences between the overall structures are concentrated in loop regions and are relatively small. The protein-inhibitor contacts are interpreted in terms of the catalytic mechanism. The general base His 12 interacts with the 2' oxygen, as does the electrostatic catalyst Lys 41. The general acid His 119 has 2 conformations (A and B) in the native structure and is found in, respectively, the A and the B conformation in the d(CpA) and the 3'-CMP complex. From the present structures and from a comparison with RNase T1, we propose that His 119 is active in the A conformation. The structure of the d(CpA) complex permits a detailed analysis of the downstream binding site, which includes His 119 and Asn 71. The comparison of the present RNase A structures with an inhibitor complex of RNase T1 shows that there are important similarities in the active sites of these 2 enzymes, despite the absence of any sequence homology. The water molecules were analyzed in order to identify conserved water sites. Seventeen water sites were found to be conserved in RNase A structures from 5 different space groups. It is proposed that 7 of those water molecules play a role in the binding of the N-terminal helix to the rest of the protein and in the stabilization of the active site.</p>

<p>The cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that generate prostaglandin H(2) from arachidonic acid (AA). Although AA is the preferred substrate, other fatty acids are oxygenated by these enzymes with varying efficiencies. We determined the crystal structures of AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) bound to Co(3+)-protoporphyrin IX-reconstituted murine COX-2 to 2.1, 2.4, and 2.65 A, respectively. AA, EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid bind in different conformations in each monomer constituting the homodimer in their respective structures such that one monomer exhibits nonproductive binding and the other productive binding of the substrate in the cyclooxygenase channel. The interactions identified between protein and substrate when bound to COX-1 are conserved in our COX-2 structures, with the only notable difference being the lack of interaction of the carboxylate of AA and EPA with the side chain of Arg-120. Leu-531 exhibits a different side chain conformation when the nonproductive and productive binding modes of AA are compared. Unlike COX-1, mutating this residue to Ala, Phe, Pro, or Thr did not result in a significant loss of activity or substrate binding affinity. Determination of the L531F:AA crystal structure resulted in AA binding in the same global conformation in each monomer. We speculate that the mobility of the Leu-531 side chain increases the volume available at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel and contributes to the observed ability of COX-2 to oxygenate a broad spectrum of fatty acid and fatty ester substrates.</p>

<p>Neisseria meningitidis is the causative agent of meningitis and meningococcal septicemia is a major cause of disease worldwide, resulting in brain damage and hearing loss, and can be fatal in a large proportion of cases. The enzyme 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) catalyzes the first reaction in the shikimate pathway leading to the biosynthesis of aromatic metabolites including the aromatic acids l-Trp, l-Phe, and l-Tyr. This pathway is absent in humans, meaning that enzymes of the pathway are considered as potential candidates for therapeutic intervention. As the entry point, feedback inhibition of DAH7PS by pathway end products is a key mechanism for the control of pathway flux. The structure of the single DAH7PS expressed by N. meningitidis was determined at 2.0 Å resolution. In contrast to the other DAH7PS enzymes, which are inhibited only by a single aromatic amino acid, the N. meningitidis DAH7PS was inhibited by all three aromatic amino acids, showing greatest sensitivity to l-Phe. An N. meningitidis enzyme variant, in which a single Ser residue at the bottom of the inhibitor-binding cavity was substituted to Gly, altered inhibitor specificity from l-Phe to l-Tyr. Comparison of the crystal structures of both unbound and Tyr-bound forms and the small angle X-ray scattering profiles reveal that N. meningtidis DAH7PS undergoes no significant conformational change on inhibitor binding. These observations are consistent with an allosteric response arising from changes in protein motion rather than conformation, and suggest ligands that modulate protein dynamics may be effective inhibitors of this enzyme. </p>

<p>TMC114 (darunavir) is a promising clinical inhibitor of HIV-1 protease (PR) for treatment of drug resistant HIV/AIDS. We report the ultra-high 0.84 A resolution crystal structure of the TMC114 complex with PR containing the drug-resistant mutation V32I (PR(V32I)), and the 1.22 A resolution structure of a complex with PR(M46L). These structures show TMC114 bound at two distinct sites, one in the active-site cavity and the second on the surface of one of the flexible flaps in the PR dimer. Remarkably, TMC114 binds at these two sites simultaneously in two diastereomers related by inversion of the sulfonamide nitrogen. Moreover, the flap site is shaped to accommodate the diastereomer with the S-enantiomeric nitrogen rather than the one with the R-enantiomeric nitrogen. The existence of the second binding site and two diastereomers suggest a mechanism for the high effectiveness of TMC114 on drug-resistant HIV and the potential design of new inhibitors.</p>

<p>Dehaloperoxidase (DHP A), a unique multifunctional enzyme, from the marine annelid Amphitrite ornata dehalogenates 2,4,6-tribromophenol to form 2,6-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone. The catalytic cycle of DHP is similar to that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), involving a high-valent ferryl heme and two single-electron transfers from the aromatic substrate to the enzyme. Like HRP, DHP has been investigated as a potential bioremediation enzyme. However, DHP fails as a bioremediation enzyme because, unlike HRP, it has an internal binding cavity on the distal side of the heme capable of accommodating p-bromophenols, which act as an inhibitor of peroxidase function. Blocking internal binding in DHP may be the key to allowing the enzyme to function effectively as a peroxidase on the full range of halogenated phenols. The distal cavity of DHP is surrounded by several hydrophobic amino acids that stabilize internal binding of the monohalogenated phenols, including a leucine residue near the back edge of the heme (L100). We have expressed the L100F, L100Q, L100T, and L100V mutants of DHP in an effort to prevent internal binding and thereby convert the inhibitors into substrates. Kinetic assays and resonance Raman indicate that the peroxidase activity of the L100T and L100F mutants is increased compared to that of native DHP in the presence of 4-bromophenol (4-BP), suggesting a reduction in the inhibitor binding constant. In addition, the X-ray crystal structure of L100F clearly indicates a reduced occupancy of the 4-BP inhibitor in the distal cavity of DHP. However, at the same time, the L100F structure reveals that steric interference alone is insufficient to exclude the inhibitor. Instead, the comparison of L100T and isosteric L100V reveals that an increase in polarity plays a decisive role in excluding the inhibitor from the distal binding pocket.</p>

<p>Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of the genetically encoded guanine at the wobble position of tRNAs(His,Tyr,Asp,Asn) by the premodified base preQ1, which is further converted to queuine at the tRNA level. As eucaryotes are not able to synthesise queuine de novo but acquire it through their diet, eucaryotic Tgt directly inserts the hypermodified base into the wobble position of the tRNAs mentioned above. Bacterial Tgt is required for the efficient pathogenicity of Shigella sp, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and, hence, it constitutes a putative target for the rational design of anti-Shigellosis compounds. Since mammalian Tgt is known to be indirectly essential to the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, it is necessary to create substances which only inhibit bacterial but not eucaryotic Tgt. Therefore, it seems of utmost importance to study selectivity-determining features within both types of proteins. Homology models of Caenorhabditis elegans Tgt and human Tgt suggest that the replacement of Cys158 and Val233 in bacterial Tgt (Zymomonas mobilis Tgt numbering) by valine and accordingly glycine in eucaryotic Tgt largely accounts for the different substrate specificities. In the present study we have created mutated variants of Z. mobilis Tgt in order to investigate the impact of a Cys158Val and a Val233Gly exchange on catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we gained evidence that the Cys158Val mutation reduces the affinity to preQ1 while leaving the affinity to guanine unaffected. The Val233Gly exchange leads to an enlarged substrate binding pocket, that is necessary to accommodate queuine in a conformation compatible with the intermediately covalently bound tRNA molecule. Contrary to our expectations, we found that a priori queuine is recognised by the binding pocket of bacterial Tgt without, however, being used as a substrate.</p>

<p>In contrast with other animal species, humans possess three distinct genes for class I alcohol dehydrogenase and show polymorphic variation in the ADH1B and ADH1C genes. The three class I alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes share approximately 93% sequence identity but differ in their substrate specificity and their developmental expression. We report here the first three-dimensional structures for the ADH1A and ADH1C*2 gene products at 2.5 and 2.0 A, respectively, and the structure of the ADH1B*1 gene product in a binary complex with cofactor at 2.2 A. Not surprisingly, the overall structure of each isoenzyme is highly similar to the others. However, the substitution of Gly for Arg at position 47 in the ADH1A isoenzyme promotes a greater extent of domain closure in the ADH1A isoenzyme, whereas substitution at position 271 may account for the lower turnover rate for the ADH1C*2 isoenzyme relative to its polymorphic variant, ADH1C*1. The substrate-binding pockets of each isoenzyme possess a unique topology that dictates each isoenzyme's distinct but overlapping substrate preferences. ADH1*B1 has the most restrictive substrate-binding site near the catalytic zinc atom, whereas both ADH1A and ADH1C*2 possess amino acid substitutions that correlate with their better efficiency for the oxidation of secondary alcohols. These structures describe the nature of their individual substrate-binding pockets and will improve our understanding of how the metabolism of beverage ethanol affects the normal metabolic processes performed by these isoenzymes.</p>

Although AA is the preferred substrate, other fatty acids are oxygenated by these enzymes with varying efficiencies.

<p>Pyranose 2-oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of a number of carbohydrates using dioxygen; glucose, for example, is oxidized at carbon 2. The structure of pyranose 2-oxidase with the reaction product 2-keto-beta-d-glucose bound in the active center is reported in a new crystal form at 1.41 A resolution. The binding structure suggests that the alpha-anomer cannot be processed. The binding mode of the oxidized product was used to model other sugars accepted by the enzyme and to explain its specificity and catalytic rates. The reported structure at pH 6.0 shows a drastic conformational change in the loop of residues 454-461 (loop 454-461) at the active center compared to that of a closely homologous enzyme analyzed at pH 4.5 with a bound acetate inhibitor. In our structures, the loop is highly mobile and shifts to make way for the sugar to pass into the active center. Presumably, loop 454-461 functions as a gatekeeper. Apart from the wild-type enzyme, a thermostable variant was analyzed at 1.84 A resolution. In this variant, Glu542 is exchanged for a lysine. The observed stabilization could be a result of the mutated residue changing an ionic contact at a comparatively weak interface of the tetramer.</p>

<p>Phosphinothricin is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). The resolution of the native structure of GS from Salmonella typhimurium has been extended to 2.5 A resolution, and the improved model is used to determine the structure of phosphinothricin complexed to GS by difference Fourier methods. The structure suggests a noncovalent, dead-end mechanism of inhibition. Phosphinothricin occupies the glutamate substrate pocket and stabilizes the Glu327 flap in a position which blocks the glutamate entrance to the active site, trapping the inhibitor on the enzyme. One oxygen of the phosphinyl group of phosphinothricin appears to be protonated, because of its proximity to the carboxylate group of Glu327. The other phosphinyl oxygen protrudes into the negatively charged binding pocket for the substrate ammonium, disrupting that pocket. The distribution of charges in the glutamate binding pocket is complementary to those of phosphinothricin. The presence of a second ammonium binding site within the active site is confirmed by its analogue thallous ion, marking the ammonium site and its protein ligands. The inhibition of GS by methionine sulfoximine can be explained by the same mechanism. These models of inhibited GS further illuminate its catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Alginate lyases depolymerize alginate, a heteropolysaccharide consisting of alpha-L-guluronate and beta-D-mannuronate, through a beta-elimination reaction. Their structure/function relationships are expected to provide information valuable to future industrial alginate processing and drug design for Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate biofilm-dependent infection, but much remains unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure at 1.0 A resolution and the results of mutational analysis of Sphingomonas sp. A1 alginate lyase A1-II', which is grouped into the polysaccharide lyase (PL) family-7. The overall structure of A1-II' uses a beta-sandwich fold, and it has a large active cleft covered by two short flexible loops. Comparison with other family PL-7 structures indicated that loop opening is necessary for substrate binding when the catalytic reaction is initiated. In contrast to the disorder in many side-chains on the protein surface, the three adjacent beta-strands at the center of the active cleft are well ordered. This results from hydrogen bond networks and stacking-like associations identical with those in other family PL-7 structures. Disruption of these interactions by site-directed mutagenesis (R146A, E148A, R150A, Q189A, and K280A) makes the protein insoluble or greatly decreases its activity. The A1-II' structure includes two sulfate ions in the active cleft. Ammonium sulfate was a potent inhibitor with a Ki of 2.5 mM, indicating that our structure represents a model of the inhibitory state. Results of mutational analysis and continuous hydrogen bond networks suggest that Arg146, Gln189, His191, and Tyr284 form an active center. Tyr284OH appears particularly crucial to the catalytic reaction, which is supported by sulfate ion binding and the proximity to the C5 and O4 atoms of subsite +1 in the model obtained by energy minimization calculations using tri-mannuronate. The structural basis shown by this study is similar in many respects to that of the family PL-5 enzymes.</p>

<p>The binding modes of four active site-directed, acylating inhibitors of human alpha-thrombin have been determined using X-ray crystallography. These inhibitors (GR157368, GR166081, GR167088, and GR179849) are representatives of a series utilizing a novel 5, 5-trans-lactone template to specifically acylate Ser195 of thrombin, resulting in an acyl complex. In each case the crystal structure of the complex reveals a binding mode which is consistent with the formation of a covalent bond between the ring-opened lactone of the inhibitor and residue Ser195. Improvements in potency and selectivity of these inhibitors for thrombin are rationalized on the basis of the observed protein/inhibitor interactions identified in these complexes. Occupation of the thrombin S2 and S3 pockets is shown to be directly correlated with improved binding and a degree of selectivity. The binding mode of GR179849 to thrombin is compared with the thrombin/PPACK complex [Bode, W., Turk, D., and Karshikov, A. (1992) Protein Sci. 1, 426-471] as this represents the archetypal binding mode for a thrombin inhibitor. This series of crystal structures is the first to be reported of synthetic, nonpeptidic acylating inhibitors bound to thrombin and provides details of the molecular recognition features that resulted in nanomolar potency.</p>

<p>Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of the genetically encoded guanine at the wobble position of tRNAs(His,Tyr,Asp,Asn) by the premodified base preQ1, which is further converted to queuine at the tRNA level. As eucaryotes are not able to synthesise queuine de novo but acquire it through their diet, eucaryotic Tgt directly inserts the hypermodified base into the wobble position of the tRNAs mentioned above.

Therefore, it seems of utmost importance to study selectivity-determining features within both types of proteins. Homology models of Caenorhabditis elegans Tgt and human Tgt suggest that the replacement of Cys158 and Val233 in bacterial Tgt (Zymomonas mobilis Tgt numbering) by valine and accordingly glycine in eucaryotic Tgt largely accounts for the different substrate specificities. In the present study we have created mutated variants of Z. mobilis Tgt in order to investigate the impact of a Cys158Val and a Val233Gly exchange on catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we gained evidence that the Cys158Val mutation reduces the affinity to preQ1 while leaving the affinity to guanine unaffected. The Val233Gly exchange leads to an enlarged substrate binding pocket, that is necessary to accommodate queuine in a conformation compatible with the intermediately covalently bound tRNA molecule. Contrary to our expectations, we found that a priori queuine is recognised by the binding pocket of bacterial Tgt without, however, being used as a substrate.</p>

<p>The Vibrio cholerae bacterium causes devastating diarrhea when it infects the human intestine. The key event is adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation of the human signaling protein GSalpha, catalyzed by the cholera toxin A1 subunit (CTA1). This reaction is allosterically activated by human ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), a family of essential and ubiquitous G proteins. Crystal structures of a CTA1:ARF6-GTP (guanosine triphosphate) complex reveal that binding of the human activator elicits dramatic changes in CTA1 loop regions that allow nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to bind to the active site. The extensive toxin:ARF-GTP interface surface mimics ARF-GTP recognition of normal cellular protein partners, which suggests that the toxin has evolved to exploit promiscuous binding properties of ARFs.</p>

<p>The main peptidase (M(pro)) from the coronavirus (CoV) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is one of the most attractive molecular targets for the development of anti-SARS agents. We report the irreversible inhibition of SARS-CoV M(pro) by an aza-peptide epoxide (APE; k(inact)/K(i) = 1900(+/-400) M(-1) s(-1)). The crystal structures of the M(pro):APE complex in the space groups C2 and P2(1)2(1)2(1) revealed the formation of a covalent bond between the catalytic Cys145 S(gamma) atom of the peptidase and the epoxide C3 atom of the inhibitor, substantiating the mode of action of this class of cysteine-peptidase inhibitors. The aza-peptide component of APE binds in the substrate-binding regions of M(pro) in a substrate-like manner, with excellent structural and chemical complementarity. In addition, the crystal structure of unbound M(pro) in the space group C2 revealed that the "N-fingers" (N-terminal residues 1 to 7) of both protomers of M(pro) are well defined and the substrate-binding regions of both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation at the crystallization pH of 6.5, contrary to the previously determined crystal structures of unbound M(pro) in the space group P2(1).</p>

<p>The amino acid residue tryptophan 27 of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was replaced by tyrosine. The structures of the W27Y mutant protein in complex with riboflavin, the substrate analogue 5-nitroso-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, and the product analogue 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine, were determined by X-ray crystallography at resolutions of 2.7-2.8 A. Whereas the indole system of W27 forms a coplanar pi-complex with riboflavin, the corresponding phenyl ring in the W27Y mutant establishes only peripheral contact with the heterocyclic ring system of the bound riboflavin. These findings provide an explanation for the absence of the long wavelength shift in optical absorption spectra of riboflavin bound to the mutant enzyme. The structures of the mutants are important tools for the interpretation of the unusual physical properties of riboflavin in complex with lumazine synthase.</p>

<p>Helicases that unwind DNA at the replication fork are ring-shaped oligomeric enzymes that move along one strand of a DNA duplex and catalyze the displacement of the complementary strand in a reaction that is coupled to nucleotide hydrolysis. The helicase domain of the replicative helicase-primase protein from bacteriophage T7 crystallized as a helical filament that resembles the Escherichia coli RecA protein, an ATP-dependent DNA strand exchange factor. When viewed in projection along the helical axis of the crystals, six protomers of the T7 helicase domain resemble the hexameric rings seen in electron microscopic images of the intact T7 helicase-primase. Nucleotides bind at the interface between pairs of adjacent subunits where an arginine is near the gamma-phosphate of the nucleotide in trans. The bound nucleotide stabilizes the folded conformation of a DNA-binding motif located near the center of the ring. These and other observations suggest how conformational changes are coupled to DNA unwinding activity.</p>

<p>A series of 138 nonchiral 3-amidinobenzyl-1H-indole-2-carboxamides and analogues as inhibitors of the blood coagulation enzyme factor Xa (fXa) were designed, synthesized, and investigated by X-ray structure analysis and 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies (CoMFA, CoMSIA) in order to identify important protein-ligand interactions responsible for biological affinity and selectivity. Several compounds from this series are highly potent and selective inhibitors of this important enzyme linking extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. To rationalize biological affinity and to provide guidelines for further design, all compounds were docked into the factor Xa binding site. Those docking studies were based on X-ray structures of factor Xa in complex with literature-known inhibitors. It was possible to validate those binding modes by four X-ray crystal structures of representative ligands in factor Xa, while one ligand was additionally crystallized in trypsin to rationalize requirements for selective factor Xa inhibition. The 3D-QSAR models based on a superposition rule derived from these docking studies were validated using conventional and cross-validated r(2) values using the leave-one-out method and repeated analyses using two randomly chosen cross-validation groups plus randomization of biological activities. This led to consistent and highly predictive 3D-QSAR models with good correlation coefficients for both CoMFA and CoMSIA, which were found to correspond to experimentally determined factor Xa binding site topology in terms of steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic complementarity. Subsets selected as smaller training sets using 2D fingerprints and maximum dissimilarity methods resulted in 3D-QSAR models with remarkable correlation coefficients and a high predictive power. The final quantitative SAR information agrees with all experimental data for the binding topology and thus provides reasonable activity predictions for novel factor Xa inhibitors.</p>

<p>AIDS chemotherapy is limited by inadequate intracellular concentrations of the active triphosphate form of nucleoside analogues, leading to incomplete inhibition of viral replication and the appearance of drug-resistant virus. Drug activation by nucleoside diphosphate kinase and inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were studied comparatively. We synthesized analogues with a borano (BH(3)(-)) group on the alpha-phosphate, and found that they are substrates for both enzymes. X-ray structures of complexes with nucleotide diphosphate kinase provided a structural basis for their activation. The complex with d4T triphosphate displayed an intramolecular CH.O bond contributing to catalysis, and the R(p) diastereoisomer of thymidine alpha-boranotriphosphate bound like a normal substrate. Using alpha-(R(p))-boranophosphate derivatives of the clinically relevant compounds AZT and d4T, the presence of the alpha-borano group improved both phosphorylation by nucleotide diphosphate kinase and inhibition of reverse transcription. Moreover, repair of blocked DNA chains by pyrophosphorolysis was reduced significantly in variant reverse transcriptases bearing substitutions found in drug-resistant viruses. Thus, the alpha-borano modification of analogues targeting reverse transcriptase may be of generic value in fighting viral drug resistance.</p>

<p>In our previous crystallographic studies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease-substrate complexes, we described a conserved "envelope" that appears to be important for substrate recognition and the selection of drug-resistant mutations. In this study, the complex of HIV-1 protease with the inhibitor RO1 was determined and comparison with the substrate envelope provides a rationale for mutational patterns.</p>

<p>Sirtuins are protein deacetylases regulating metabolism, stress responses, and aging processes, and they were suggested to mediate the lifespan extending effect of a low calorie diet. Sirtuin activation by the polyphenol resveratrol can mimic such lifespan extending effects and alleviate metabolic diseases. The mechanism of Sirtuin stimulation is unknown, hindering the development of improved activators. Here we show that resveratrol inhibits human Sirt3 and stimulates Sirt5, in addition to Sirt1, against fluorophore-labeled peptide substrates but also against peptides and proteins lacking the non-physiological fluorophore modification. We further present crystal structures of Sirt3 and Sirt5 in complex with fluorogenic substrate peptide and modulator. The compound acts as a top cover, closing the Sirtuin's polypeptide binding pocket and influencing details of peptide binding by directly interacting with this substrate. Our results provide a mechanism for the direct activation of Sirtuins by small molecules and suggest that activators have to be tailored to a specific Sirtuin/substrate pair.</p>

<p>Fragment-based screens test multiple low-molecular weight molecules for binding to a target. Fragments often bind with low affinities but typically have better ligand efficiencies (DeltaG(bind)/heavy atom count) than traditional screening hits. This efficiency, combined with accompanying atomic-resolution structures, has made fragments popular starting points for drug discovery programs. Fragment-based design adopts a constructive strategy: affinity is enhanced either by cycles of functional-group addition or by joining two independent fragments together. The final inhibitor is expected to adopt the same geometry as the original fragment hit. Here we consider whether the inverse, deconstructive logic also applies--can one always parse a higher-affinity inhibitor into fragments that recapitulate the binding geometry of the larger molecule? Cocrystal structures of fragments deconstructed from a known beta-lactamase inhibitor suggest that this is not always the case.</p>

<p>GRL-0519 (1) is a potent antiviral inhibitor of HIV-1 protease (PR) possessing tris-tetrahydrofuran (tris-THF) at P2. The high resolution X-ray crystal structures of inhibitor 1 in complexes with single substitution mutants PR(R8Q), PR(D30N), PR(I50V), PR(I54M), and PR(V82A) were analyzed in relation to kinetic data. The smaller valine side chain in PR(I50V) eliminated hydrophobic interactions with inhibitor and the other subunit consistent with 60-fold worse inhibition. Asn30 in PR(D30N) showed altered interactions with neighboring residues and 18-fold worse inhibition. Mutations V82A and I54M showed compensating structural changes consistent with 6-7-fold lower inhibition. Gln8 in PR(R8Q) replaced the ionic interactions of wild type Arg8 with hydrogen bond interactions without changing the inhibition significantly. The carbonyl oxygen of Gly48 showed two alternative conformations in all structures likely due to the snug fit of the large tris-THF group in the S2 subsite in agreement with high antiviral efficacy of 1 on resistant virus.</p>

<p>Rhomboids are membrane-embedded serine proteases that cleave membrane protein substrates. Escherichia coli rhomboid GlpG (ecGlpG) consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a membrane domain containing the active site. We determined the crystal structure of the soluble cytoplasmic domain of ecGlpG at 1.35Å resolution and examined whether this domain affected the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The structure revealed that the ecGlpG cytoplasmic domain exists as a dimer with extensive domain swapping between the two monomers. Domain-swapped dimers can be isolated from the full-length protein, suggesting that this is a physiologically relevant structure. An extensive steady-state kinetic analysis of the full-length ecGlpG and its membrane domain using soluble and transmembrane model protein substrates resulted in an unexpected conclusion: removal of the cytoplasmic domain does not alter the catalytic parameters for detergent-solubilized rhomboid for both substrates.</p>

<p>A human dihydropteridine reductase (EC 1.6.99.10) has been created from a rat cDNA clone by a single five-oligonucleotide mutagenesis reaction and expressed in good yield in Escherichia coli. The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity, and kinetic identity to the naturally occurring enzyme has been proven. Crystallization has also been achieved, and the crystal structure was solved using 2.5 A data that was refined to an R value of 16.9%. The structure described in this report represents the first complete structural characterization of this important human enzyme.</p>

<p>We have used chemical protein synthesis and advanced physical methods to probe dynamics-function correlations for the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme that has received considerable attention as a target for the treatment of AIDS. Chemical synthesis was used to prepare a series of unique analogues of the HIV-1 protease in which the flexibility of the "flap" structures (residues 37-61 in each monomer of the homodimeric protein molecule) was systematically varied. These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations. We show that conformational isomerization in the flaps is correlated with structural reorganization of residues in the active site, and that it is preorganization of the active site that is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis.</p>

<p>X-ray crystallography typically uses a single set of coordinates and B factors to describe macromolecular conformations. Refinement of multiple copies of the entire structure has been previously used in specific cases as an alternative means of representing structural flexibility. Here, we systematically validate this method by using simulated diffraction data, and we find that ensemble refinement produces better representations of the distributions of atomic positions in the simulated structures than single-conformer refinements. Comparison of principal components calculated from the refined ensembles and simulations shows that concerted motions are captured locally, but that correlations dissipate over long distances. Ensemble refinement is also used on 50 experimental structures of varying resolution and leads to decreases in R(free) values, implying that improvements in the representation of flexibility observed for the simulated structures may apply to real structures. These gains are essentially independent of resolution or data-to-parameter ratio, suggesting that even structures at moderate resolution can benefit from ensemble refinement.</p>

<p>Substitution mutations in the BRAF serine/threonine kinase are found in a variety of human cancers. Such mutations occur in approximately 70% of human malignant melanomas, and a single hyperactivating V600E mutation is found in the activation segment of the kinase domain and accounts for more than 90% of these mutations. Given this correlation, the molecular mechanism for BRAF regulation as well as oncogenic activation has attracted considerable interest, and activated forms of BRAF, such as BRAF(V600E), have become attractive targets for small molecule inhibition. Here we report on the identification and subsequent optimization of a potent BRAF inhibitor, CS292, based on an organometallic kinase inhibitor scaffold. A cocrystal structure of CS292 in complex with the BRAF kinase domain reveals that CS292 binds to the ATP binding pocket of the kinase and is an ATP competitive inhibitor. The structure of the kinase-inhibitor complex also demonstrates that CS292 binds to BRAF in an active conformation and suggests a mechanism for regulation of BRAF by phosphorylation and BRAF(V600E) oncogene-induced activation. The structure of CS292 bound to the active form of the BRAF kinase also provides a novel scaffold for the design of BRAF(V600E) oncogene selective BRAF inhibitors for therapeutic application.</p>

<p>Prostaglandin H2 synthase (EC 1.14.99.1) is an integral membrane enzyme containing a cyclooxygenase site, which is the target for the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and a spatially distinct peroxidase site. Previous crystallographic studies of this clinically important drug target have been hindered by low resolution. We present here the 2.0 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of ovine prostaglandin H2 synthase-1 in complex with alpha-methyl-4-biphenylacetic acid, a defluorinated analog of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug flurbiprofen. Detergent molecules are seen to bind to the protein's membrane-binding domain, and their positions suggest the depth to which this domain is likely to penetrate into the lipid bilayer. The relation of the enzyme's proximal heme ligand His388 to the heme iron is atypical for a peroxidase; the iron-histidine bond is unusually long and a substantial tilt angle is observed between the heme and imidazole planes. A molecule of glycerol, used as a cryoprotectant during diffraction experiments, is seen to bind in the peroxidase site, offering the first view of any ligand in this active site. Insights gained from glycerol binding may prove useful in the design of a peroxidase-specific ligand.</p>

<p>The enzyme 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylic acid (HCCA) isomerase catalyzes the glutathione (GSH)-dependent interconversion (Keq = 1.5) of HCCA and trans-o-hydroxybenzylidene pyruvic acid (tHBPA) in the naphthalene catabolic pathway of Pseudomonas putida. The dimeric protein binds one molecule of GSH very tightly (Kd approximately 5 nM) and a second molecule of GSH with much lower affinity (Kd approximately 2 to 11 microM). The enzyme is unstable in the absence of GSH. The turnover number in the forward direction (47 s(-1) at 25 degrees C) greatly exceeds off rates for GSH (koff approximately 10(-3) to 10(-2) s(-1) at 10 degrees C), suggesting that GSH acts as a tightly bound cofactor in the reaction. The crystal structure of the enzyme at 1.7 A resolution reveals that the isomerase is closely related to class kappa GSH transferases. Diffraction quality crystals could only be obtained in the presence of GSH and HCCA/tHBPA. Clear electron density is seen for GSH. Electron density for the organic substrates is located near the GSH and is best modeled to include both HCCA and tHBPA at occupancies of 0.5 for each. Although there is no electron density connecting the sulfur of GSH to the organic substrates, the sulfur is located very close (2.78 A) to C7 of HCCA. Taken together, the results suggest that the isomerization reaction involves a short-lived covalent adduct between the sulfur of GSH and C7 of the substrate.</p>

<p>Aldehyde dehydrogenases catalyze the oxidation of aldehyde substrates to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Lactaldehyde dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli (aldA gene product, P25553) is an NAD(+)-dependent enzyme implicated in the metabolism of l-fucose and l-rhamnose. During the heterologous expression and purification of taxadiene synthase from the Pacific yew, lactaldehyde dehydrogenase from E. coli was identified as a minor (&lt;/=5%) side-product subsequent to its unexpected crystallization. Accordingly, we now report the serendipitous crystal structure determination of unliganded lactaldehyde dehydrogenase from E. coli determined by the technique of multiple isomorphous replacement using anomalous scattering at 2.2 A resolution. Additionally, we report the crystal structure of the ternary enzyme complex with products lactate and NADH at 2.1 A resolution, and the crystal structure of the enzyme complex with NADPH at 2.7 A resolution. The structure of the ternary complex reveals that the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor is disordered between two conformations: one with the ring positioned in the active site in the so-called hydrolysis conformation, and another with the ring extended out of the active site into the solvent region, designated the out conformation. This represents the first crystal structure of an aldehyde dehydrogenase-product complex. The active site pocket in which lactate binds is more constricted than that of medium-chain dehydrogenases such as the YdcW gene product of E. coli. The structure of the binary complex with NADPH reveals the first view of the structural basis of specificity for NADH: the negatively charged carboxylate group of E179 destabilizes the binding of the 2'-phosphate group of NADPH sterically and electrostatically, thereby accounting for the lack of enzyme activity with this cofactor.</p>

<p>The Chlorella virus enzyme vAL-1 (38 kDa), a member of polysaccharide lyase family 14, degrades the Chlorella cell wall by cleaving the glycoside bond of the glucuronate residue (GlcA) through a beta-elimination reaction. The enzyme consists of an N-terminal cell wall-attaching domain (11 kDa) and a C-terminal catalytic module (27 kDa). Here, we show the enzyme characteristics of vAL-1, especially its pH-dependent modes of action, and determine the structure of the catalytic module. vAL-1 also exhibited alginate lyase activity at alkaline pH, and truncation of the N-terminal domain increased the lyase activity by 50-fold at pH 7.0. The truncated form vAL-1(S) released di- to hexasaccharides from alginate at pH 7.0, whereas disaccharides were preferentially generated at pH 10.0. This indicates that vAL-1(S) shows two pH-dependent modes of action: endo- and exotypes. The x-ray crystal structure of vAL-1(S) at 1.2 A resolution showed two antiparallel beta-sheets with a deep cleft showing a beta-jelly roll fold. The structure of GlcA-bound vAL-1(S) at pH 7.0 and 10.0 was determined: GlcA was found to be bound outside and inside the cleft at pH 7.0 and 10.0, respectively. This suggests that the electric charges at the active site greatly influence the binding mode of substrates and regulate endo/exo activity. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that vAL-1(S) has a specific amino acid arrangement distinct from other alginate lyases crucial for catalysis. This is, to our knowledge, the first study in which the structure of a family 14 polysaccharide lyase with two different modes of action has been determined.</p>

Electron density for the organic substrates is located near the GSH and is best modeled to include both HCCA and tHBPA at occupancies of 0.5 for each. Although there is no electron density connecting the sulfur of GSH to the organic substrates, the sulfur is located very close (2.78 A) to C7 of HCCA. Taken together, the results suggest that the isomerization reaction involves a short-lived covalent adduct between the sulfur of GSH and C7 of the substrate.</p>

<p>Involved in the coagulation cascade, factor Xa (FXa) is a serine protease which has received great interest as a potential target for the development of new antithrombotics. Although there is a great wealth of structural data on thrombin complexes, few structures of ligand/FXa complexes have been reported, presumably because of the difficulty in growing crystals. Reproducible crystallization conditions for human des-Gla1-45 coagulation FXa have been found. This has led to an improvement in the diffraction quality of the crystals (about 2.1 A) when compared to the previously reported forms (2.3-2.8 A) thus providing a suitable platform for a structure-based drug design approach. A series of crystal structures of noncovalent inhibitors complexed with FXa have been determined, three of which are presented herein. These include compounds containing the benzamidine moiety and surrogates of the basic group. The benzamidine-containing compound binds in a canonical fashion typical of synthetic serine protease inhibitors. On the contrary, molecules that contain surrogates of the benzamidine group do not make direct hydrogen-bonding interactions with the carboxylate of Asp189 at the bottom of the S1 pocket. The structural data provide a likely explanation for the specificity of these inhibitors and a great aid in the design of bioavailable potent FXa inhibitors.</p>

<p>Metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) require Zn(2+) or Fe(2+) to regulate the acetylation of lysine residues in histones and other proteins in eukaryotic cells. Isozyme HDAC8 is perhaps the archetypical member of the class I HDAC family and serves as a paradigm for studying structure-function relationships. Here, we report the structures of HDAC8 complexes with trichostatin A and 3-(1-methyl-4-phenylacetyl-1H-2-pyrrolyl)-N-hydroxy-2-propenamide (APHA) in a new crystal form. The structure of the APHA complex reveals that the hydroxamate CO group accepts a hydrogen bond from Y306 but does not coordinate to Zn(2+) with favorable geometry, perhaps due to the constraints of its extended pi system. Additionally, since APHA binds to only two of the three protein molecules in the asymmetric unit of this complex, the structure of the third monomer represents the first structure of HDAC8 in the unliganded state. Comparison of unliganded and liganded structures illustrates ligand-induced conformational changes in the L2 loop that likely accompany substrate binding and catalysis. Furthermore, these structures, along with those of the D101N, D101E, D101A, and D101L variants, support the proposal that D101 is critical for the function of the L2 loop. However, amino acid substitutions for D101 can also trigger conformational changes of Y111 and W141 that perturb the substrate binding site. Finally, the structure of H143A HDAC8 complexed with an intact acetylated tetrapeptide substrate molecule confirms the importance of D101 for substrate binding and reveals how Y306 and the active site zinc ion together bind and activate the scissile amide linkage of acetyllysine.</p>

<p>Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is a crucial enzyme in carbon fixation and the most abundant protein on earth. It has been studied extensively by biochemical and structural methods; however, the most essential activation step has not yet been described. Here, we describe the mechanistic details of Lys carbamylation that leads to RuBisCO activation by atmospheric CO(2). We report two crystal structures of nitrosylated RuBisCO from the red algae Galdieria sulphuraria with O(2) and CO(2) bound at the active site. G. sulphuraria RuBisCO is inhibited by cysteine nitrosylation that results in trapping of these gaseous ligands. The structure with CO(2) defines an elusive, preactivation complex that contains a metal cation Mg(2+) surrounded by three H(2)O/OH molecules. Both structures suggest the mechanism for discriminating gaseous ligands by their quadrupole electric moments. We describe conformational changes that allow for intermittent binding of the metal ion required for activation. On the basis of these structures we propose the individual steps of the activation mechanism. Knowledge of all these elements is indispensable for engineering RuBisCO into a more efficient enzyme for crop enhancement or as a remedy to global warming.</p>

<p>Decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD; EC 4.1.1.9) is an essential facet in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. The structure of human peroxisomal MCD reveals a molecular tetramer that is best described as a dimer of structural heterodimers, in which the two subunits present markedly different conformations. This molecular organization is consistent with half-of-the-sites reactivity. Each subunit has an all-helix N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal domain with an acetyltransferase fold (GNAT superfamily). Intersubunit disulfide bridges, Cys-206-Cys-206 and Cys-243-Cys-243, can link the four subunits of the tetramer, imparting positive cooperativity to the catalytic process. The combination of a half-of-the-sites mechanism within each structural heterodimer and positive cooperativity in the tetramer produces a complex regulatory picture that is further complicated by the multiple intracellular locations of the enzyme. Transport into the peroxisome has been investigated by docking human MCD onto the peroxisomal import protein peroxin 5, which revealed interactions that extend beyond the C-terminal targeting motif.</p>

<p>Both hospital- and community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus infections have become major health concerns in terms of morbidity, suffering and cost. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is an alternative treatment for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections. However, TMP-resistant strains have arisen with point mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the target for TMP. A single point mutation, F98Y, has been shown biochemically to confer the majority of this resistance to TMP. Using a structure-based approach, we have designed a series of novel propargyl-linked DHFR inhibitors that are active against several trimethoprim-resistant enzymes. We screened this series against wild-type and mutant (F98Y) S. aureus DHFR and found that several are active against both enzymes and specifically that the meta-biphenyl class of these inhibitors is the most potent. In order to understand the structural basis of this potency, we determined eight high-resolution crystal structures: four each of the wild-type and mutant DHFR enzymes bound to various propargyl-linked DHFR inhibitors. In addition to explaining the structure-activity relationships, several of the structures reveal a novel conformation for the cofactor, NADPH. In this new conformation that is predominantly associated with the mutant enzyme, the nicotinamide ring is displaced from its conserved location and three water molecules complete a network of hydrogen bonds between the nicotinamide ring and the protein. In this new position, NADPH has reduced interactions with the inhibitor. An equilibrium between the two conformations of NADPH, implied by their occupancies in the eight crystal structures, is influenced both by the ligand and the F98Y mutation. The mutation induced equilibrium between two NADPH-binding conformations may contribute to decrease TMP binding and thus may be responsible for TMP resistance.</p>

<p>Many reactions in cells proceed via the sequestration of two DNA molecules in a synaptic complex. SfiI is a member of a growing family of restriction enzymes that can bind and cleave two DNA sites simultaneously. We present here the structures of tetrameric SfiI in complex with cognate DNA. The structures reveal two different binding states of SfiI: one with both DNA-binding sites fully occupied and the other with fully and partially occupied sites. These two states provide details on how SfiI recognizes and cleaves its target DNA sites, and gives insight into sequential binding events. The SfiI recognition sequence (GGCCNNNN[downward arrow]NGGCC) is a subset of the recognition sequence of BglI (GCCNNNN[downward arrow]NGGC), and both enzymes cleave their target DNAs to leave 3-base 3' overhangs. We show that even though SfiI is a tetramer and BglI is a dimer, and there is little sequence similarity between the two enzymes, their modes of DNA recognition are unusually similar.</p>

<p>The presence of a regulatory site for monovalent cations that affects the conformation of the MgATP-binding pocket leading to enzyme activation has been demonstrated for ribokinases. This site is selective toward the ionic radius of the monovalent cation, accepting those larger than Na(+). Phosphofructokinase-2 (Pfk-2) from Escherichia coli is homologous to ribokinase, but unlike other ribokinase family members, presents an additional site for the nucleotide that negatively regulates its enzymatic activity. In this work, we show the effect of monovalent cations on the kinetic parameters of Pfk-2 together with its three-dimensional structure determined by x-ray diffraction in the presence of K(+) or Cs(+). Kinetic characterization of the enzyme shows that K(+) and Na(+) alter neither the kcat nor the KM values for fructose-6-P or MgATP. However, the presence of K(+) (but not Na(+)) enhances the allosteric inhibition induced by MgATP. Moreover, binding experiments show that K(+) (but not Na(+)) increases the affinity of MgATP in a saturable fashion. In agreement with the biochemical data, the crystal structure of Pfk-2 obtained in the presence of MgATP shows a cation-binding site at the conserved position predicted for the ribokinase family of proteins. This site is adjacent to the MgATP allosteric binding site and is only observed in the presence of Cs(+) or K(+). These results indicate that binding of the monovalent metal ions indirectly influences the allosteric site of Pfk-2 by increasing its affinity for MgATP with no alteration in the conformation of residues present at the catalytic site.</p>

<p>Serine/threonine kinase PIM1 is an emerging therapeutic target for hematopoietic and prostate cancer therapy. To develop a novel PIM1 inhibitor, we focused on 1, a metabolically labile, nonselective kinase inhibitor discovered in our previous screening study. We adopted a rational optimization strategy based mainly on structural information for the PIM1-1 complex to improve the potency and selectivity. This approach afforded the potent and metabolically stable PIM1-selective inhibitor 14, which shows only a marginal increase in molecular weight compared with 1 but has a significantly decreased cLogP. The validity of our design concept was confirmed by X-ray structure analysis. In a cellular study, 14 potently inhibited the growth of human leukemia cell line MV4-11 but had a negligible effect on the growth of WI-38 (surrogate for general toxicity). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design strategy for evolving the screening-hit compound 1 into a novel type of PIM1 inhibitor, 14.</p>

<p>The serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 is emerging as a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Much attention has recently been focused on identifying potential Pim-1 inhibitor candidates for the treatment of haematopoietic malignancies. The outcome of a rational drug-design project has recently been reported [Nakano et al. (2012), J. Med. Chem. 55, 5151-5156]. The report described the process of optimization of the structure-activity relationship and detailed from a medicinal chemistry perspective the development of a low-potency and nonselective compound initially identified from in silico screening into a potent, selective and metabolically stable Pim-1 inhibitor. Here, the structures of the initial in silico hits are reported and the noteworthy features of the Pim-1 complex structures are described. A particular focus was placed on the rearrangement of the glycine-rich P-loop region that was observed for one of the initial compounds, (Z)-7-(azepan-1-ylmethyl)-2-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methylidene]-6-hydroxy-1-benzofuran-3(2H)-one (compound 1), and was also found in all further derivatives. This novel P-loop conformation, which appears to be stabilized by an additional interaction with the β3 strand located above the binding site, is not usually observed in Pim-1 structures.</p>

<p>Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichloro-phenoxy)-phenol, TCL) is a well known inhibitor against enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR), an enzyme critical for cell-wall synthesis of bacteria. The inhibitory concentration at 50% inhibition (IC(50)) of TCL against the Escherichia coli ENR is 150nM for wild type (WT), 380, 470 and 68,500nM for Ala, Ser and Val mutants, respectively. To understand this high TCL resistance in the G93V mutant, we obtained the crystal structures of mutated ENRs complexed with TCL and NAD(+). The X-ray structural analysis along with the ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations explains the serious consequence in the G93V mutant complex. The major interactions around TCL due to the aromatic(cation)-aromatic and hydrogen bonding interactions are found to be conserved both in WT and mutant complexes. Thus, the overall structural change of protein is minimal except that a flexible α-helical turn around TCL is slightly pushed away due to the presence of the bulky valine group. However, TCL shows substantial edge-to-face aromatic (π)-interactions with both the flexible R192-F203 region and the residues in the close vicinity of G93. The weakening of some edge-to-face aromatic interactions around TCL in the G93V mutant results in serious resistance to TCL. This understanding is beneficial to design new generation of antibiotics which will effectively act on the mutant ENRs.</p>

<p>Beta,gamma-fluoromethylene analogues of nucleotides are considered to be useful mimics of the natural substrates, but direct structural evidence defining their active site interactions has not been available, including the influence of the new chiral center introduced at the CHF carbon, as in beta,gamma-fluoromethylene-dGTP, which forms an active site complex with DNA polymerase beta, a repair enzyme that plays an important role in base excision repair (BER) and oncogenesis. We report X-ray crystallographic results for a series of beta,gamma-CXY dGTP analogues, where X,Y = H, F, Cl, Br, and/or CH(3). For all three R/S monofluorinated analogues examined (CHF, 3/4; CCH(3)F, 13/14; CClF 15/16), a single CXF-diastereomer (3, 13, 16) is observed in the active site complex, with the CXF fluorine atom at a approximately 3 A (bonding) distance to a guanidinium N of Arg183. In contrast, for the CHCl, CHBr, and CHCH(3) analogues, both diasteromers (6/7, 8/9, 10/11) populate the dGTP site in the enzyme complex about equally. The structures of the bound dichloro (5) and dimethyl (12) analogue complexes indicate little to no steric effect on the placement of the bound nucleotide backbone. The results suggest that introduction of a single fluorine atom at the beta,gamma-bridging carbon atom of these dNTP analogues enables a new, stereospecific interaction within the preorganized active site complex that is unique to fluorine. The results also provide the first diverse structural data set permitting an assessment of how closely this class of dNTP analogues mimics the conformation of the parent nucleotide within the active site complex.</p>

<p>Predicting absolute protein-ligand binding affinities remains a frontier challenge in ligand discovery and design. This becomes more difficult when ionic interactions are involved because of the large opposing solvation and electrostatic attraction energies. In a blind test, we examined whether alchemical free-energy calculations could predict binding affinities of 14 charged and 5 neutral compounds previously untested as ligands for a cavity binding site in cytochrome c peroxidase. In this simplified site, polar and cationic ligands compete with solvent to interact with a buried aspartate. Predictions were tested by calorimetry, spectroscopy, and crystallography. Of the 15 compounds predicted to bind, 13 were experimentally confirmed, while 4 compounds were false negative predictions. Predictions had a root-mean-square error of 1.95 kcal/mol to the experimental affinities, and predicted poses had an average RMSD of 1.7Å to the crystallographic poses. This test serves as a benchmark for these thermodynamically rigorous calculations at predicting binding affinities for charged compounds and gives insights into the existing sources of error, which are primarily electrostatic interactions inside proteins. Our experiments also provide a useful set of ionic binding affinities in a simplified system for testing new affinity prediction methods.</p>

<p>The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase is an emerging target for antitumor therapy. In this letter, we describe the discovery of 2-((1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones as potent and selective PKM2 activators which were found to have a novel binding mode. The original lead identified from high throughput screening was optimized into an efficient series via computer-aided structure-based drug design. Both a representative compound from this series and an activator described in the literature were used as molecular tools to probe the biological effects of PKM2 activation on cancer cells. Our results suggested that PKM2 activation alone is not sufficient to alter cancer cell metabolism.</p>

<p>The inhibition of the class A SHV-1 β-lactamase by 7-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)methylidenecephalosporin sulfone was examined kinetically, spectroscopically, and crystallographically. An 1.14 Å X-ray crystal structure shows that the stable acyl-enzyme, which incorporates an eight-membered ring, is a covalent derivative of Ser70 linked to the 7-carboxy group of 2-H-5,8-dihydro-1,1-dioxo-1,5-thiazocine-4,7-dicarboxylic acid. A cephalosporin-derived enzyme complex of this type is unprecedented, and the rearrangement leading to its formation may offer new possibilities for inhibitor design. The observed acyl-enzyme derives its stability from the resonance stabilization conveyed by the β-aminoacrylate (i.e., vinylogous urethane) functionality as there is relatively little interaction of the eight-membered ring with active site residues. Two mechanistic schemes are proposed, differing in whether, subsequent to acylation of the active site serine and opening of the β-lactam, the resultant dihydrothiazine fragments on its own or is assisted by an adjacent nucleophilic atom, in the form of the carbonyl oxygen of the C7 tert-butyloxycarbonyl group. This compound was also found to be a submicromolar inhibitor of the class C ADC-7 and PDC-3 β-lactamases. </p>

<p>There are major issues regarding the proposed pathway for starch degradation in germinating cereal grain. Given the commercial importance but genetic intractability of the problem, we have embarked on a program of chemical genetics studies to identify and dissect the pathway and regulation of starch degradation in germinating barley grains. As a precursor to in vivo studies, here we report systematic analysis of the reversible and irreversible inhibition of the major β-amylase of the grain endosperm (BMY1). The molecular basis of inhibitor action was defined through high resolution X-ray crystallography studies of unliganded barley β-amylase, as well as its complexes with glycone site binder disaccharide iminosugar G1M, irreversible inhibitors α-epoxypropyl and α-epoxybutyl glucosides, which target the enzyme's catalytic residues, and the aglycone site binders acarbose and α-cyclodextrin.</p>

<p>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are enzymes whose endogenous reaction is the reversible hydration of CO(2) to give HCO(3)(-) and a proton. CA are also known to exhibit weak and promiscuous esterase activity toward activated esters. Here, we report a series of findings obtained with a set of CA inhibitors that showed quite unexpectedly that the compounds were both inhibitors of CO(2) hydration and substrates for the esterase activity of CA. The compounds comprised a monosaccharide core with the C-6 primary hydroxyl group derivatized as a sulfamate (for CA recognition). The remaining four sugar hydroxyl groups were acylated. Using protein X-ray crystallography, the crystal structures of human CA II in complex with four of the sulfamate inhibitors were obtained. As expected, the four structures displayed the canonical CA protein-sulfamate interactions. Unexpectedly, a free hydroxyl group was observed at the anomeric center (C-1) rather than the parent C-1 acyl group. In addition, this hydroxyl group is observed axial to the carbohydrate ring while in the parent structure it is equatorial. A mechanism is proposed that accounts for this inversion of stereochemistry. For three of the inhibitors, the acyl groups at C-2 or at C-2 and C-3 were also absent with hydroxyl groups observed in their place and retention of stereochemistry. With the use of electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS), we observed directly the sequential loss of all four acyl groups from one of the carbohydrate-based sulfamates. For this compound, the inhibitor and substrate binding mode were further analyzed using free energy calculations. These calculations suggested that the parent compound binds almost exclusively as a substrate. To conclude, we have demonstrated that acylated carbohydrate-based sulfamates are simultaneously inhibitor and substrate of human CA II. Our results suggest that, initially, the substrate binding mode dominates, but following hydrolysis, the ligand can also bind as a pure inhibitor thereby competing with the substrate binding mode.</p>

<p>BRAF(V600E) is the most frequent oncogenic protein kinase mutation known. Furthermore, inhibitors targeting "active" protein kinases have demonstrated significant utility in the therapeutic repertoire against cancer. Therefore, we pursued the development of specific kinase inhibitors targeting B-Raf, and the V600E allele in particular. By using a structure-guided discovery approach, a potent and selective inhibitor of active B-Raf has been discovered. PLX4720, a 7-azaindole derivative that inhibits B-Raf(V600E) with an IC(50) of 13 nM, defines a class of kinase inhibitor with marked selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays. PLX4720 preferentially inhibits the active B-Raf(V600E) kinase compared with a broad spectrum of other kinases, and potent cytotoxic effects are also exclusive to cells bearing the V600E allele. Consistent with the high degree of selectivity, ERK phosphorylation is potently inhibited by PLX4720 in B-Raf(V600E)-bearing tumor cell lines but not in cells lacking oncogenic B-Raf. In melanoma models, PLX4720 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis exclusively in B-Raf(V600E)-positive cells. In B-Raf(V600E)-dependent tumor xenograft models, orally dosed PLX4720 causes significant tumor growth delays, including tumor regressions, without evidence of toxicity. The work described here represents the entire discovery process, from initial identification through structural and biological studies in animal models to a promising therapeutic for testing in cancer patients bearing B-Raf(V600E)-driven tumors.</p>

<p>The protein kinase MPS1 is a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint signal and is aberrantly overexpressed in many human cancers. MPS1 is one of the top 25 genes overexpressed in tumors with chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. PTEN-deficient breast tumor cells are particularly dependent upon MPS1 for their survival, making it a target of significant interest in oncology. We report the discovery and optimization of potent and selective MPS1 inhibitors based on the 1H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine scaffold, guided by structure-based design and cellular characterization of MPS1 inhibition, leading to 65 (CCT251455). This potent and selective chemical tool stabilizes an inactive conformation of MPS1 with the activation loop ordered in a manner incompatible with ATP and substrate-peptide binding; it displays a favorable oral pharmacokinetic profile, shows dose-dependent inhibition of MPS1 in an HCT116 human tumor xenograft model, and is an attractive tool compound to elucidate further the therapeutic potential of MPS1 inhibition. </p>

<p>Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) cleave glycosidic linkages in carbohydrates, typically via inverting or retaining mechanisms, the latter of which proceeds via a two-step mechanism that includes formation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. We present two new structures of the catalytic domain of Hypocrea jecorina GH Family 7 cellobiohydrolase Cel7A, namely a Michaelis complex with a full cellononaose ligand and a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, that reveal details of the 'static' reaction coordinate. We also employ transition path sampling to determine the 'dynamic' reaction coordinate for the catalytic cycle. The glycosylation reaction coordinate contains components of forming and breaking bonds and a conformational change in the nucleophile. Deglycosylation proceeds via a product-assisted mechanism wherein the glycosylation product, cellobiose, positions a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. In concert with previous structures, the present results reveal the complete hydrolytic reaction coordinate for this naturally and industrially important enzyme family. </p>

<p>We present a fusion system suited to determine the crystal structure of small disulfide-rich proteins. McoEeTI, a hybrid inhibitor cystine knot microprotein, was produced as a soluble fusion to a catalytically inactive variant of the RNAse barnase in Escherichia coli. Functioning as a versatile tag, barnase facilitated purification, crystallization and high-resolution structure determination. Flexibility of the linker region allows for different relative orientations of barnase and the fusion partner in two crystallographically independent molecules and may thereby facilitate crystal packing. Nevertheless, the linker region is well ordered in both molecules. This system may prove more generally useful to determine the crystal structure of peptides and small proteins.</p>

<p>The Sir2 family of proteins consists of broadly conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases that are implicated in diverse biological processes, including DNA regulation, metabolism, and longevity. Sir2 proteins are regulated in part by the cellular concentrations of a noncompetitive inhibitor, nicotinamide, that reacts with a Sir2 reaction intermediate via a base-exchange reaction to reform NAD(+) at the expense of deacetylation. To gain a mechanistic understanding of nicotinamide inhibition in Sir2 enzymes, we captured the structure of nicotinamide bound to a Sir2 homolog, yeast Hst2, in complex with its acetyl-lysine 16 histone H4 substrate and a reaction intermediate analog, ADP-HPD. Together with related biochemical studies and structures, we identify a nicotinamide inhibition and base-exchange site that is distinct from the so-called "C pocket" binding site for the nicotinamide group of NAD(+). These results provide insights into the Sir2 mechanism of nicotinamide inhibition and have important implications for the development of Sir2-specific effectors.</p>

<p>Fragment screens for new ligands have had wide success, notwithstanding their constraint to libraries of 1,000-10,000 molecules. Larger libraries would be addressable were molecular docking reliable for fragment screens, but this has not been widely accepted. To investigate docking's ability to prioritize fragments, a library of &gt;137,000 such molecules were docked against the structure of beta-lactamase. Forty-eight fragments highly ranked by docking were acquired and tested; 23 had K(i) values ranging from 0.7 to 9.2 mM. X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme-bound complexes were determined for 8 of the fragments. For 4, the correspondence between the predicted and experimental structures was high (RMSD between 1.2 and 1.4 A), whereas for another 2, the fidelity was lower but retained most key interactions (RMSD 2.4-2.6 A). Two of the 8 fragments adopted very different poses in the active site owing to enzyme conformational changes. The 48% hit rate of the fragment docking compares very favorably with "lead-like" docking and high-throughput screening against the same enzyme. To understand this, we investigated the occurrence of the fragment scaffolds among larger, lead-like molecules. Approximately 1% of commercially available fragments contain these inhibitors whereas only 10(-7)% of lead-like molecules do. This suggests that many more chemotypes and combinations of chemotypes are present among fragments than are available among lead-like molecules, contributing to the higher hit rates. The ability of docking to prioritize these fragments suggests that the technique can be used to exploit the better chemotype coverage that exists at the fragment level.</p>

<p>Well ordered reproducible crystals of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides yield a previously unreported structure at 2.0 A resolution that contains the two catalytic subunits and a number of alkyl chains of lipids and detergents. Comparison with crystal structures of other bacterial and mammalian CcOs reveals that the positions occupied by native membrane lipids and detergent substitutes are highly conserved, along with amino acid residues in their vicinity, suggesting a more prevalent and specific role of lipid in membrane protein structure than often envisioned. Well defined detergent head groups (maltose) are found associated with aromatic residues in a manner similar to phospholipid head groups, likely contributing to the success of alkyl glycoside detergents in supporting membrane protein activity and crystallizability. Other significant features of this structure include the following: finding of a previously unreported crystal contact mediated by cadmium and an engineered histidine tag; documentation of the unique His-Tyr covalent linkage close to the active site; remarkable conservation of a chain of waters in one proton pathway (D-path); and discovery of an inhibitory cadmium-binding site at the entrance to another proton path (K-path). These observations provide important insight into CcO structure and mechanism, as well as the significance of bound lipid in membrane proteins.</p>

<p>Here we present a time-resolved crystallographic analysis of the hydrolysis of exo (Sp) guanosine 2',3'-cyclophosphorothioate by RNase T1. The use of a slow substrate and fast crystallization methods made it possible to perform the study with conventional data-collection techniques. The results support the idea that the hydrolysis reaction proceeds through a mechanism that is the inverse of the transesterification reaction. In addition, the structures provide an explanation for the differential behavior of RNase T1 towards exo- and endo-cyclic thiophosphates.</p>

<p>SHP-1 (PTPN6) is a member of the SHP sub-family of protein tyrosine phosphatases and plays a critical role in the regulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Previous studies suggested that SHP-1 contains a PTP1B-like second phosphotyrosine pocket that allows for binding of tandem phosphotyrosine residues, such as those found in the activation loop of JAK kinases. To discover the structural nature of the interaction between SHP-1 and the JAK family member, JAK1, we determined the 1.8Å co-crystal structure of the SHP-1 catalytic domain and a JAK1-derived substrate peptide. This structure reveals electron density for only one bound phosphotyrosine residue. To investigate the role of the predicted second site pocket we determined the structures of SHP-1 in complex with phosphate and sulfate to 1.37Å and 1.7Å, respectively, and performed anomalous scattering experiments for a selenate-soaked crystal. These crystallographic data suggest that SHP-1 does not contain a PTP1B-like second site pocket. This conclusion is further supported by analysis of the relative dephosphorylation and binding affinities of mono- and tandem-phosphorylated peptide substrates. The crystal structures instead indicate that SHP-1 contains an extended C-terminal helix α2' incompatible with the predicted second phosphotyrosine binding site. This study suggests that SHP-1 defines a new category of PTP1B-like protein tyrosine phosphatases with a hindered second phosphotyrosine pocket.</p>

<p>The rapid expansion of the amount of genomic and structural data has provided many examples of enzymes with evolutionarily related active sites that catalyze different reactions. Functional comparisons of these active sites can provide insight into the origins of the enormous catalytic proficiency of enzymes and the evolutionary changes that can lead to different enzyme activities. The alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily is an ideal system to use in making such comparisons given the extensive data available on both nonenzymatic and enzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions. Some superfamily members, such as AP itself, preferentially hydrolyze phosphate monoesters, whereas others, such as nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP), preferentially hydrolyze phosphate diesters. We have measured rate constants for NPP-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphate diesters and monoesters. NPP preferentially catalyzes diester hydrolysis by factors of 10(2)-10(6), depending on the identity of the diester substrate. To identify features of the NPP active site that could lead to preferential phosphate diester hydrolysis, we have determined the structure of NPP in the absence of ligands and in complexes with vanadate and AMP. Comparisons to existing structures of AP reveal bimetallo cores that are structurally indistinguishable, but there are several distinct structural features outside of the conserved bimetallo site. The structural and functional data together suggest that some of these distinct functional groups provide specific substrate binding interactions, whereas others tune the properties of the bimetallo active site itself to discriminate between phosphate diester and monoester substrates.</p>

<p>Berberine bridge enzyme catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation and carbon-carbon bond formation of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine. In addition to this type of reactivity the enzyme can further oxidize (S)-scoulerine to the deeply red protoberberine alkaloid dehydroscoulerine albeit with a much lower rate of conversion. In the course of the four electron oxidation, no dihydroprotoberberine species intermediate was detectable suggesting that the second oxidation step leading to aromatization proceeds at a much faster rate. Performing the reaction in the presence of oxygen and under anoxic conditions did not affect the kinetics of the overall reaction suggesting no strict requirement for oxygen in the oxidation of the unstable dihydroprotoberberine intermediate. In addition to the kinetic characterization of this reaction we also present a structure of the enzyme in complex with the fully oxidized product. Combined with information available for the binding modes of (S)-reticuline and (S)-scoulerine a possible mechanism for the additional oxidation is presented. This is compared to previous reports of enzymes ((S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase and canadine oxidase) showing a similar type of reactivity in different plant species.</p>

<p>The inclusion of novel small molecules in crystallization experiments has provided very encouraging results and this method is now emerging as a promising alternative strategy for crystallizing 'problematic' biological macromolecules. These small molecules have the ability to promote lattice formation through stabilizing intermolecular interactions in protein crystals. Here, the use of 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid (PTS), which provides a helpful intermolecular bridge between Leishmania mexicana PYK (LmPYK) macromolecules in the crystal, is reported, resulting in the rapid formation of a more stable crystal lattice at neutral pH and greatly improved X-ray diffraction results. The refined structure of the LmPYK-PTS complex revealed the negatively charged PTS molecule to be stacked between positively charged (surface-exposed) arginine side chains from neighbouring LmPYK molecules in the crystal lattice.</p>

<p>Specific activation of amino acids by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is essential for maintaining translational fidelity. Here, we present crystal structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (sTrpRS) in apo form and in complexes with various ligands. In each complex, there is a sulfate ion bound at the active site which mimics the alpha- or beta-phosphate group of ATP during tryptophan activation. In particular, in one monomer of the sTrpRS-TrpNH(2)O complex, the sulfate ion appears to capture a snapshot of the alpha-phosphate of ATP during its movement towards tryptophan. Simulation study of a human TrpRS-Trp-ATP model shows that during the catalytic process the alpha-phosphate of ATP is driven to an intermediate position equivalent to that of the sulfate ion, then moves further and eventually fluctuates at around 2 A from the nucleophile. A conserved Arg may interact with the oxygen in the scissile bond at the transition state, indicating its critical role in the nucleophilic substitution. Taken together, eukaryotic TrpRSs may adopt an associative mechanism for tryptophan activation in contrast to a dissociative mechanism proposed for bacterial TrpRSs. In addition, structural analysis of the apo sTrpRS reveals a unique feature of fungal TrpRSs, which could be exploited in rational antifungal drug design.</p>

<p>The crystal structures of two ternary complexes of the large fragment of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I (Klentaq1) with a primer/template DNA and dideoxycytidine triphosphate, and that of a binary complex of the same enzyme with a primer/template DNA, were determined to a resolution of 2.3, 2.3 and 2.5 A, respectively. One ternary complex structure differs markedly from the two other structures by a large reorientation of the tip of the fingers domain. This structure, designated 'closed', represents the ternary polymerase complex caught in the act of incorporating a nucleotide. In the two other structures, the tip of the fingers domain is rotated outward by 46 degrees ('open') in an orientation similar to that of the apo form of Klentaq1. These structures provide the first direct evidence in DNA polymerase I enzymes of a large conformational change responsible for assembling an active ternary complex.</p>

<p>This is the first structural evidence of recognition of mRNA cap structures by a ribosome inactivating protein. It is well known that a unique cap structure is formed at the 5' end of mRNA for carrying out various processes including mRNA maturation, translation initiation, and RNA turnover. The binding studies and crystal structure determinations of type 1 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP-1) from Momordica balsamina (MbRIP-1) were carried out with mRNA cap structures including (i) N7-methyl guanine (m7G), (ii) N7-methyl guanosine diphosphate (m7GDP), and (iii) N7-methyl guanosine triphosphate (m7GTP). These compounds showed affinities to MbRIP-1 at nanomolar concentrations. The structure determinations of the complexes of MbRIP-1 with m7G, m7GDP, and m7GTP at 2.65, 1.77, and 1.75 Å resolutions revealed that all the three compounds bound to MbRIP-1 in the substrate binding site at the positions which are slightly shifted towards Glu85 as compared to those of rRNA substrates. In this position, Glu85 forms several hydrogen bonds with guanine moiety while N-7 methyl group forms van der Waals contacts. However, the guanine rings are poorly stacked in these complexes. Thus, the mode of binding by MbRIP-1 to mRNA cap structures is different which results in the inhibition of depurination. Since some viruses are known to exploit the capping property of the host, this action of MbRIP-1 may have implications for the antiviral activity of this protein in vivo. The understanding of the mode of binding of MbRIP-1 to cap structures may also assist in the design of anti-viral agents.</p>

<p>The structure of malate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli complexed with the substrate analog, citrate and the cofactor NAD, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. A monoclinic crystal of the malate dehydrogenase, grown in citrate buffer, was soaked in 10 mM NAD solution and found to be isomorphous with the apo-form. The X-ray data extended to 1.9 A, nearly the same resolution limit as the apo-enzyme crystals. The ternary complex of malate dehydrogenase has very few conformational differences from that of the pseudo binary complex of enzyme with bound citrate. In addition, the NAD molecule has a very similar conformation to the NAD as found in the crystal structure of the cytosolic eukaryotic malate dehydrogenase. Similar hydrogen bond interactions are made by both enzymes from polar groups belonging to the NAD. Such interactions include hydrogen bonds from the ribose oxygens and the phosphate oxygens, to backbone amide and carbonyl atoms of the protein and to side-chains of a select few conserved hydrophilic residues. The only notable difference occurs in the active site region where the nicotinamide moiety is obstructed from further entering the active site by the C-6 carbonyl atoms of citrate. In this position there are no direct polar interactions between the protein and the nicotinamide moiety. Energy minimization of the structure with malate substituted for citrate in the active site shows that the nicotinamide moiety assumes the same position in the active site as the NAD in cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. The carboxamide atoms of the energy minimized model make significant hydrogen bond interactions with the catalytic residue, H177, and with the main-chain atoms of I117 and V146 in the vicinity of the active site, while the position of the rest of the cofactor remains unchanged.</p>

<p>Disruption of the unusual thiol-based redox homeostasis mechanisms in Staphylococcus aureus represents a unique opportunity to identify new metabolic processes and new targets for intervention. Targeting uncommon aspects of CoASH biosynthetic and redox functions in S. aureus, the antibiotic CJ-15,801 has recently been demonstrated to be an antimetabolite of the CoASH biosynthetic pathway in this organism; CoAS-mimetics containing α,β-unsaturated sulfone and carboxyl moieties have also been exploited as irreversible inhibitors of S. aureus coenzyme A-disulfide reductase (SaCoADR). In this work we have determined the crystal structures of three of these covalent SaCoADR-inhibitor complexes, prepared by inactivation of wild-type enzyme during turnover. The structures reveal the covalent linkage between the active-site Cys43-S(γ) and C(β) of the vinyl sulfone or carboxyl moiety. The full occupancy of two inhibitor molecules per enzyme dimer, together with kinetic analyses of the wild-type/C43S heterodimer, indicates that half-sites-reactivity is not a factor during normal catalytic turnover. Further, we provide the structures of SaCoADR active-site mutants; in particular, Tyr419'-OH plays dramatic roles in directing intramolecular reduction of the Cys43-SSCoA redox center, in the redox asymmetry observed for the two FAD per dimer in NADPH titrations, and in catalysis. The two conformations observed for the Ser43 side chain in the C43S mutant structure lend support to a conformational switch for Cys43-S(γ) during its catalytic Cys43-SSCoA/Cys43-SH redox cycle. Finally, the structures of the three inhibitor complexes provide a framework for design of more effective inhibitors with therapeutic potential against several major bacterial pathogens.</p>

<p>In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the NAD(P)(+)-dependent betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (PaBADH) may play the dual role of assimilating carbon and nitrogen from choline or choline precursors--abundant at infection sites--and producing glycine betaine and NADPH, potentially protective against the high-osmolarity and oxidative stresses prevalent in the infected tissues. Disruption of the PaBADH gene negatively affects the growth of bacteria, suggesting that this enzyme could be a target for antibiotic design. PaBADH is one of the few ALDHs that efficiently use NADP(+) and one of the even fewer that require K(+) ions for stability. Crystals of PaBADH were obtained under aerobic conditions in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, glycerol, NADP(+) and K(+) ions. The three-dimensional structure was determined at 2.1-A resolution. The catalytic cysteine (C286, corresponding to C302 of ALDH2) is oxidized to sulfenic acid or forms a mixed disulfide with 2-mercaptoethanol. The glutamyl residue involved in the deacylation step (E252, corresponding to E268 of ALDH2) is in two conformations, suggesting a proton relay system formed by two well-conserved residues (E464 and K162, corresponding to E476 and K178, respectively, of ALDH2) that connects E252 with the bulk water. In some active sites, a bound glycerol molecule mimics the thiohemiacetal intermediate; its hydroxyl oxygen is hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen of the amide groups of the side chain of the conserved N153 (N169 of ALDH2) and those of the main chain of C286, which form the "oxyanion hole." The nicotinamide moiety of the nucleotide is not observed in the crystal, and the adenine moiety binds in the usual way. A salt bridge between E179 (E195 of ALDH2) and R40 (E53 of ALDH2) moves the carboxylate group of the former away from the 2'-phosphate of the NADP(+), thus avoiding steric clashes and/or electrostatic repulsion between the two groups. Finally, the crystal shows two K(+) binding sites per subunit. One is in an intrasubunit cavity that we found to be present in all known ALDH structures. The other--not described before for any ALDH but most likely present in most of them--is located in between the dimeric unit, helping structure a region involved in coenzyme binding and catalysis. This may explain the effects of K(+) ions on the activity and stability of PaBADH.</p>

<p>A loop (residues 794-803) at the active site of β-galactosidase (Escherichia coli) opens and closes during catalysis. The α and β carbons of Ser-796 form a hydrophobic connection to Phe-601 when the loop is closed while a connection via two H-bonds with the Ser hydroxyl occurs with the loop open. β-Galactosidases with substitutions for Ser-796 were investigated. Replacement by Ala strongly stabilizes the closed conformation because of greater hydrophobicity and loss of H-bonding ability while replacement with Thr stabilizes the open form through hydrophobic interactions with its methyl group. Upon substitution with Asp much of the defined loop structure is lost. The different open-closed equilibria cause differences in the stabilities of the enzyme·substrate and enzyme·transition state complexes and of the covalent intermediate that affect the activation thermodynamics. With Ala, large changes of both the galactosylation (k(2)) and degalactosylation (k(3)) rates occur. With Thr and Asp, the k(2) and k(3) were not changed as much but large ΔH(‡) and TΔS(‡) changes showed that the substitutions caused mechanistic changes. Overall, the hydrophobic and H-bonding properties of Ser-796 result in interactions strong enough to stabilize the open or closed conformations of the loop but weak enough to allow loop movement during the reaction.</p>

<p>Tenofovir, also known as PMPA, R-9-(2-(phosphonomethoxypropyl)adenine, is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor. We have determined the crystal structures of two related complexes of HIV-1 RT with template primer and tenofovir: (i) a ternary complex at a resolution of 3.0 A of RT crosslinked to a dideoxy-terminated DNA with tenofovir-diphosphate bound as the incoming substrate; and (ii) a RT-DNA complex at a resolution of 3.1 A with tenofovir at the 3' primer terminus. The tenofovir nucleotide in the tenofovir-terminated structure seems to adopt multiple conformations. Some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including 3TC and AZT, have elements ('handles') that project beyond the corresponding elements on normal dNTPs (the 'substrate envelope'). HIV-1 RT resistance mechanisms to AZT and 3TC take advantage of these handles; tenofovir's structure lacks handles that could protrude through the substrate envelope to cause resistance.</p>

<p>Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), one of the central components of the renin-angiotensin system, is a key therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Human somatic ACE (sACE) has two homologous domains (N and C). The N- and C-domain catalytic sites have different activities toward various substrates. Moreover, some of the undesirable side effects of the currently available and widely used ACE inhibitors may arise from their targeting both domains leading to defects in other pathways. In addition, structural studies have shown that although both these domains have much in common at the inhibitor binding site, there are significant differences and these are greater at the peptide binding sites than regions distal to the active site. As a model system, we have used an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE, a single domain protein with ACE activity) to study ACE inhibitor binding. In an extensive study, we present high-resolution structures for native AnCE and in complex with six known antihypertensive drugs, a novel C-domain sACE specific inhibitor, lisW-S, and two sACE domain-specific phosphinic peptidyl inhibitors, RXPA380 and RXP407 (i.e., nine structures). These structures show detailed binding features of the inhibitors and highlight subtle changes in the orientation of side chains at different binding pockets in the active site in comparison with the active site of N- and C-domains of sACE. This study provides information about the structure-activity relationships that could be utilized for designing new inhibitors with improved domain selectivity for sACE.</p>

<p>The intracellular subtilisin proteases (ISPs) are the only known members of the important and ubiquitous subtilisin family that function exclusively within the cell, constituting a major component of the degradome in many Gram-positive bacteria. The first ISP structure reported herein at a spacing of 1.56 A reveals features unique among subtilisins that has enabled potential functional and physiological roles to be assigned to sequence elements exclusive to the ISPs. Unlike all other subtilisins, ISP from B. clausii is dimeric, with residues from the C terminus making a major contribution to the dimer interface by crossing over to contact the partner subunit. A short N-terminal extension binds back across the active site to provide a potential novel regulatory mechanism of intrinsic proteolytic activity: a proline residue conserved throughout the ISPs introduces a kink in the polypeptide backbone that lifts the target peptide bond out of reach of the catalytic residues.</p>

As a model system, we have used an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE, a single domain protein with ACE activity) to study ACE inhibitor binding. In an extensive study, we present high-resolution structures for native AnCE and in complex with six known antihypertensive drugs, a novel C-domain sACE specific inhibitor, lisW-S, and two sACE domain-specific phosphinic peptidyl inhibitors, RXPA380 and RXP407 (i.e., nine structures). These structures show detailed binding features of the inhibitors and highlight subtle changes in the orientation of side chains at different binding pockets in the active site in comparison with the active site of N- and C-domains of sACE. This study provides information about the structure-activity relationships that could be utilized for designing new inhibitors with improved domain selectivity for sACE.</p>

<p>We report the crystallographic structures of the potent phosphoantigens Phosphostim (the bromohydrin of isopentenyl pyrophosphate) and E-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate bound to the mevalonate pathway enzyme isopentenyl pyrophosphate/dimethylallyl pyrophosphate isomerase (IPPI). Racemic Phosphostim forms covalent complexes with IPPI: a 4-thioether with C67 and a 4-ester with E116. Only the E116 ester forms with the chiral species, S-Phosphostim, with the w.t. enzyme, while the C67 thioether forms with a mutant Y104F IPPI. The potent phosphoantigen HMBPP also binds to IPPI, but is only a weak ( approximately 50 muM) inhibitor. These results strongly support an SN2 reaction for inhibition of IPPI by Phosphostim, in contrast to the SN1 or concerted type of reaction found with epoxide inhibitors, which react at C-3, and are of general interest in the context of the development of novel mevalonate pathway inhibitors. They also provide clues as to the nature of the binding site of synthetic phosphoantigens in gammadelta T cell activation. In particular, both bromohydrin and epoxy phosphoantigens are potent, irreversible inhibitors of IPPI while HMBPP is only a weak inhibitor, ruling out an IPPI or IPPI-like target for HMBPP in gammadelta T cell activation.</p>

<p>Fragment screens for new ligands have had wide success, notwithstanding their constraint to libraries of 1,000-10,000 molecules. Larger libraries would be addressable were molecular docking reliable for fragment screens, but this has not been widely accepted. To investigate docking's ability to prioritize fragments, a library of &gt;137,000 such molecules were docked against the structure of beta-lactamase. Forty-eight fragments highly ranked by docking were acquired and tested; 23 had K(i) values ranging from 0.7 to 9.2 mM. X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme-bound complexes were determined for 8 of the fragments. For 4, the correspondence between the predicted and experimental structures was high (RMSD between 1.2 and 1.4 A), whereas for another 2, the fidelity was lower but retained most key interactions (RMSD 2.4-2.6 A). Two of the 8 fragments adopted very different poses in the active site owing to enzyme conformational changes. The 48% hit rate of the fragment docking compares very favorably with "lead-like" docking and high-throughput screening against the same enzyme. To understand this, we investigated the occurrence of the fragment scaffolds among larger, lead-like molecules. Approximately 1% of commercially available fragments contain these inhibitors whereas only 10(-7)% of lead-like molecules do. This suggests that many more chemotypes and combinations of chemotypes are present among fragments than are available among lead-like molecules, contributing to the higher hit rates. The ability of docking to prioritize these fragments suggests that the technique can be used to exploit the better chemotype coverage that exists at the fragment level.</p>

<p>Alpha-glucuronidases, components of an ensemble of enzymes central to the recycling of photosynthetic biomass, remove the alpha-1,2 linked 4-O-methyl glucuronic acid from xylans. The structure of the alpha-glucuronidase, GlcA67A, from Pseudomonas cellulosa reveals three domains, the central of which is a (beta/alpha)(8) barrel housing the catalytic apparatus. Complexes of the enzyme with the individual reaction products, either xylobiose or glucuronic acid, and the ternary complex of both glucuronic acid and xylotriose reveal a "blind" pocket which selects for short decorated xylooligosaccharides substituted with the uronic acid at their nonreducing end, consistent with kinetic data. The catalytic center reveals a constellation of carboxylates; Glu292 is poised to provide protonic assistance to leaving group departure with Glu393 and Asp365 both appropriately positioned to provide base-catalyzed assistance for inverting nucleophilic attack by water.</p>

<p>The increasing prevalence of diabetes has accelerated the search for new drugs derived from natural sources. To define the functional features of two such families of compounds, the flavonols and the ethyl caffeates, we have determined the high-resolution structures of representative inhibitors in complex with human pancreatic α-amylase. Myricetin binds at the active site and interacts directly with the catalytic residues despite its bulky planar nature. Notably, it reduces the normal conformational flexibility of the adjacent substrate binding cleft. In contrast, bound ethyl caffeate acts by disordering precisely those polypeptide chain segments that make up the active site binding cleft. It also operates from binding sites far removed from the active site, a property not observed in any other class of human α-amylase inhibitor studied to date. Given the current inadequacy of drugs directed at diabetes, the use of optimized flavonols and ethyl caffeates may present an alternative therapeutic route.</p>

<p>Enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt have been implicated as virulence factors in several pathogenic organisms, notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans. Malate synthase has thus emerged as a promising target for design of anti-microbial agents. For this effort, it is essential to have reliable models for enzyme:substrate complexes. A 2.7 Angstroms resolution crystal structure for M. tuberculosis malate synthase in the ternary complex with magnesium, malate, and coenzyme A has been previously described. However, some unusual aspects of malate and Mg(++) binding prompted an independent determination of the structure at 2.3 Angstroms resolution, in the presence of saturating concentrations of malate. The electron density map of the complex reveals the position and conformation of coenzyme A to be unchanged from that found in the previous study. However, the coordination of Mg(++) and orientation of bound malate within the active site are different. The revised position of bound malate is consistent with a reaction mechanism that does not require reorientation of the electrophilic substrate during the catalytic cycle, while the revised Mg(++) coordination is octahedral, as expected. The results should be useful in the design of malate synthase inhibitors.</p>

<p>The genus Burkholderia includes pathogenic gram-negative bacteria that cause melioidosis, glanders, and pulmonary infections of patients with cancer and cystic fibrosis. Drug resistance has made development of new antimicrobials critical. Many approaches to discovering new antimicrobials, such as structure-based drug design and whole cell phenotypic screens followed by lead refinement, require high-resolution structures of proteins essential to the parasite.</p>

<p>Isoniazid (INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazine) is one of only two therapeutic agents effective in treating tuberculosis. This prodrug is activated by the heme enzyme catalase peroxidase (KatG) endogenous to Mycobacterium tuberculosis but the mechanism of activation is poorly understood, in part because the binding interaction has not been properly established. The class I peroxidases ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) have active site structures very similar to KatG and are also capable of activating isoniazid. We report here the first crystal structures of complexes of isoniazid bound to APX and CcP. These are the first structures of isoniazid bound to any activating enzymes. The structures show that isoniazid binds close to the delta-heme edge in both APX and CcP, although the precise binding orientation varies slightly in the two cases. A second binding site for INH is found in APX at the gamma-heme edge close to the established ascorbate binding site, indicating that the gamma-heme edge can also support the binding of aromatic substrates. We also show that in an active site mutant of soybean APX (W41A) INH can bind directly to the heme iron to become an inhibitor and in a different mode when the distal histidine is replaced by alanine (H42A). These structures provide the first unambiguous evidence for the location of the isoniazid binding site in the class I peroxidases and provide rationalization of isoniazid resistance in naturally occurring KatG mutant strains of M. tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis are attractive targets for the development of novel drugs against malaria and tuberculosis. This pathway is used exclusively by the corresponding pathogens, but not by humans. A series of water-soluble, cytidine-based inhibitors that were originally designed for the fourth enzyme in the pathway, IspD, were shown to inhibit the subsequent enzyme, the kinase IspE (from Escherichia coli). The binding mode of the inhibitors was verified by co-crystal structure analysis, using Aquifex aeolicus IspE. The crystal structures represent the first reported example of a co-crystal structure of IspE with a synthetic ligand and confirmed that ligand binding affinity originates mainly from the interactions of the nucleobase moiety in the cytidine binding pocket of the enzyme. In contrast, the appended benzimidazole moieties of the ligands adopt various orientations in the active site and establish only poor intermolecular contacts with the protein. Defined binding sites for sulfate ions and glycerol molecules, components in the crystallization buffer, near the well-conserved ATP-binding Gly-rich loop of IspE were observed. The crystal structures of A. aeolicus IspE nicely complement the one from E. coli IspE for use in structure-based design, namely by providing invaluable structural information for the design of inhibitors targeting IspE from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. Similar to the enzymes from these pathogens, A. aeolicus IspE directs the OH group of a tyrosine residue into a pocket in the active site. In the E. coli enzyme, on the other hand, this pocket is lined by phenylalanine and has a more pronounced hydrophobic character.</p>

<p>Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are important enzymatic factors in resistance to β-lactam antibiotics that show important structural and functional heterogeneity. BJP-1 is a subclass B3 MBL determinant produced by Bradyrhizobium japonicum that exhibits interesting properties. BJP-1, like CAU-1 of Caulobacter vibrioides, overall poorly recognizes β-lactam substrates and shows an unusual substrate profile compared to other MBLs. In order to understand the structural basis of these properties, the crystal structure of BJP-1 was obtained at 1.4-Å resolution. This revealed significant differences in the conformation and locations of the active-site loops, determining a rather narrow active site and the presence of a unique N-terminal helix bearing Phe-31, whose side chain binds in the active site and represents an obstacle for β-lactam substrate binding. In order to probe the potential of sulfonamides (known to inhibit various zinc-dependent enzymes) to bind in the active sites of MBLs, the structure of BJP-1 in complex with 4-nitrobenzenesulfonamide was also obtained (at 1.33-A resolution), thereby revealing the mode of interaction of these molecules in MBLs. Interestingly, sulfonamide binding resulted in the displacement of the side chain of Phe-31 from its hydrophobic binding pocket, where the benzene ring of the molecule is now found. These data further highlight the structural diversity shown by MBLs but also provide interesting insights in the structure-function relationships of these enzymes. More importantly, we provided the first structural observation of MBL interaction with sulfonamides, which might represent an interesting scaffold for the design of MBL inhibitors.</p>

<p>DNA polymerase ɛ (Pol ɛ) is a high-fidelity polymerase that has been shown to participate in leading-strand synthesis during DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. We present here a ternary structure of the catalytic core of Pol ɛ (142 kDa) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in complex with DNA and an incoming nucleotide. This structure provides information about the selection of the correct nucleotide and the positions of amino acids that might be critical for proofreading activity. Pol ɛ has the highest fidelity among B-family polymerases despite the absence of an extended β-hairpin loop that is required for high-fidelity replication by other B-family polymerases. Moreover, the catalytic core has a new domain that allows Pol ɛ to encircle the nascent double-stranded DNA. Altogether, the structure provides an explanation for the high processivity and high fidelity of leading-strand DNA synthesis in eukaryotes. </p>

<p>Bacterial phosphopentomutases (PPMs) are alkaline phosphatase superfamily members that interconvert α-D-ribose 5-phosphate (ribose 5-phosphate) and α-D-ribose 1-phosphate (ribose 1-phosphate). We investigated the reaction mechanism of Bacillus cereus PPM using a combination of structural and biochemical studies. Four high resolution crystal structures of B. cereus PPM revealed the active site architecture, identified binding sites for the substrate ribose 5-phosphate and the activator α-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (glucose 1,6-bisphosphate), and demonstrated that glucose 1,6-bisphosphate increased phosphorylation of the active site residue Thr-85. The phosphorylation of Thr-85 was confirmed by Western and mass spectroscopic analyses. Biochemical assays identified Mn(2+)-dependent enzyme turnover and demonstrated that glucose 1,6-bisphosphate treatment increases enzyme activity. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation activates the enzyme, which supports an intermolecular transferase mechanism. We confirmed intermolecular phosphoryl transfer using an isotope relay assay in which PPM reactions containing mixtures of ribose 5-[(18)O(3)]phosphate and [U-(13)C(5)]ribose 5-phosphate were analyzed by mass spectrometry. This intermolecular phosphoryl transfer is seemingly counter to what is anticipated from phosphomutases employing a general alkaline phosphatase reaction mechanism, which are reported to catalyze intramolecular phosphoryl transfer. However, the two mechanisms may be reconciled if substrate encounters the enzyme at a different point in the catalytic cycle.</p>

<p>Structure of the Leu300Pro mutant of human aldose reductase (ALR2) in complex with the inhibitor fidarestat is determined. Comparison with the hALR2-fidarestat complex and the porcine aldehyde reductase (ALR1)-fidarestat complex indicates that the hydrogen bond between the Leu300 amino group of the wild-type and the exocyclic amide group of the inhibitor is the key determinant for the specificity of fidarestat for ALR2 over ALR1. Thermodynamic data also suggest an enthalpic contribution as the predominant difference in the binding energy between the aldose reductase mutant and the wild-type. An additional selectivity-determining feature is the difference in the interaction between the inhibitor and the side chain of Trp219, ordered in the present structure but disordered (corresponding Trp220) in the ALR1-fidarestat complex. Thus, the hydrogen bond ( approximately 7 kJ/mol) corresponds to a 23-fold difference in inhibitor potency while the differences in the interactions between Trp219(ALR2) and fidarestat and between Trp220(ALR1) and fidarestat can account for an additional 10-fold difference in potency.</p>

<p>While biotechnological applications of arginine (Arg) as a solution additive that prevents protein aggregation are increasing, the molecular mechanism of its effects remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the Arg-lysozyme complex by high-resolution crystallographic analysis. Three Arg molecules were observed to be in close proximity to aromatic amino acid residues of the protein surface, and their occupancies gradually increased with increasing Arg concentration. These interactions were mediated by electrostatic, hydrophobic and cation-π interactions with the surface residues. The binding of Arg decreased the accessible surface area of aromatic residues by 40%, but increased that of charged residues by 10%. These changes might prevent intermolecular hydrophobic interactions by shielding hydrophobic regions of the lysozyme surface, resulting in an increase in protein solubility.</p>

<p>New structures of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcribing complexes reveal a likely key to transcription. The trigger loop swings beneath a correct nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) in the nucleotide addition site, closing off the active center and forming an extensive network of interactions with the NTP base, sugar, phosphates, and additional pol II residues. A histidine side chain in the trigger loop, precisely positioned by these interactions, may literally "trigger" phosphodiester bond formation. Recognition and catalysis are thus coupled, ensuring the fidelity of transcription.</p>

<p>5'-nucleotidases catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates. As catabolic enzymes they contribute significantly to the regulation of cellular nucleotide levels; misregulation of nucleotide metabolism and nucleotidase deficiencies are associated with a number of diseases. The seven human 5'-nucleotidases differ with respect to substrate specificity and cellular localization. Recently, the novel cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase III-like protein, or cN-IIIB, has been characterized in human and Drosophila. cN-IIIB exhibits a strong substrate preference for the modified nucleotide 7-methylguanosine monophosphate but the structural reason for this preference was unknown. Here, we present crystal structures of cN-IIIB from Drosophila melanogaster bound to the reaction products 7-methylguanosine or cytidine. The structural data reveal that the cytosine- and 7-methylguanine moieties of the products are stacked between two aromatic residues in a coplanar but off-centered position. 7-methylguanosine is specifically bound through π-π interactions and distinguished from unmodified guanosine by additional cation-π coulomb interactions between the aromatic side chains and the positively charged 7-methylguanine. Notably, the base is further stabilized by T-shaped edge-to-face stacking of an additional tryptophan packing perpendicularly against the purine ring and forming, together with the other aromates, an aromatic slot. The structural data in combination with site-directed mutagenesis experiments reveal the molecular basis for the broad substrate specificity of cN-IIIB but also explain the substrate preference for 7-methylguanosine monophosphate. Analyzing the substrate specificities of cN-IIIB and the main pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase cN-IIIA by mutagenesis studies, we show that cN-IIIA dephosphorylates the purine m7GMP as well, hence redefining its substrate spectrum. Docking calculations with cN-IIIA and m7GMP as well as biochemical data reveal that Asn69 does not generally exclude the turnover of purine substrates thus correcting previous suggestions. </p>

<p>Isoniazid is one of the most effective antituberculosis drugs, yet its precise mechanism of action is still controversial. Using specialized linkage transduction, a single point mutation allele (S94A) within the putative target gene inhA was transferred in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The inhA(S94A) allele was sufficient to confer clinically relevant levels of resistance to isoniazid killing and inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis. This resistance correlated with the decreased binding of the INH-NAD inhibitor to InhA, as shown by enzymatic and X-ray crystallographic analyses, and establishes InhA as the primary target of isoniazid action in M. tuberculosis.</p>

<p>hBChE [human BChE (butyrylcholinesterase)] naturally scavenges OPs (organophosphates). This bioscavenger is currently in Clinical Phase I for pretreatment of OP intoxication. Phosphylated ChEs (cholinesterases) can undergo a spontaneous time-dependent process called 'aging' during which the conjugate is dealkylated, leading to creation of an enzyme that cannot be reactivated. hBChE inhibited by phosphoramidates such as tabun displays a peculiar resistance to oxime-mediated reactivation. We investigated the basis of oxime resistance of phosphoramidyl-BChE conjugates by determining the kinetics of inhibition, reactivation (obidoxime {1,1'-(oxybis-methylene) bis[4-(hydroxyimino) methyl] pyridinium dichloride}, TMB-4 [1,3-trimethylene-bis(4-hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium) dibromide], HLö 7 {1-[[[4-(aminocarbonyl) pyridinio]methoxy]methyl]-2,4-bis-[(hydroxyimino)methyl] pyridinium dimethanesulfonate)}, HI-6 {1-[[[4-(aminocarbonyl) pyridinio] methoxy] methyl]-2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]pyridinium dichloride monohydrate} and aging, and the crystal structures of hBChE inhibited by different N-monoalkyl and N,N-dialkyl tabun analogues. The refined structures of aged hBChE conjugates show that aging proceeds through O-dealkylation of the P(R) enantiomer of N,N-diethyl and N-propyl analogues, with subsequent formation of a salt bridge preventing reactivation, similarly to a previous observation made on tabun-ChE conjugates. Interestingly, the N-methyl analogue projects its amino group towards the choline-binding pocket, so that aging proceeds through deamination. This orientation results from a preference of hBChE's acyl-binding pocket for larger than 2-atoms linear substituents. The correlation between the inhibitory potency and the N-monoalkyl chain length is related to increasingly optimized interactions with the acyl-binding pocket as shown by the X-ray structures. These kinetics and X-ray data lead to a structure-activity relationship that highlights steric and electronic effects of the amino substituent of phosphoramidate. This study provides the structural basis to design new oximes capable of reactivating phosphoramidyl-hBChE conjugates after intoxication, notably when hBChE is used as pretreatment, or to design BChE-based catalytic bioscavengers.</p>

<p>The Bürgi-Dunitz angle (αBD) describes the trajectory of approach of a nucleophile to an electrophile. The adoption of a stereoelectronically favorable αBD can necessitate significant reactive-group repositioning over the course of bond formation. In the context of enzyme catalysis, interactions with the protein constrain substrate rotation, which could necessitate structural transformations during bond formation. To probe this theoretical framework vis-à-vis biocatalysis, Schiff-base formation was analysed in Francisella tularensis transaldolase (TAL). Crystal structures of wild-type and Lys→Met mutant TAL in covalent and noncovalent complexes with fructose 6-phosphate and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate clarify the mechanism of catalysis and reveal that substrate keto moieties undergo significant conformational changes during Schiff-base formation. Structural changes compelled by the trajectory considerations discussed here bear relevance to bond formation in a variety of constrained enzymic/engineered systems and can inform the design of covalent therapeutics. </p>

<p>Inhibition of the Chk1 kinase by small molecules is of great therapeutic interest for oncology and in understanding the cellular regulation of the G2/M checkpoint. We report how computational docking of a large electronic catalogue of compounds to an X-ray structure of the Chk1 ATP-binding site allowed prioritisation of a small subset of these compounds for assay. This led to the discovery of 10 novel Chk1 inhibitors, distributed among nine new and clearly different chemical scaffolds. Several of these scaffolds have promising lead-like properties. All these ligands act by competitive binding to the targeted ATP site. The crystal structures of four of these compounds bound to this site are presented, and reasonable modelled docking modes are suggested for the 5 other scaffolds. This structural context is used to assess the potential of these scaffolds for further medicinal chemistry efforts, suggesting that several of them could be elaborated to make additional interactions with the buried part of the ATP site. Some unusual interactions with the conserved kinase backbone motif are pointed out. The ligand-binding modes are also used to discuss their medicinal chemistry potential with respect to undesirable chemical functionalities, whether these functionalities bind directly to the protein or not. Overall, this work illustrates how virtual screening can identify a diverse set of ligands which bind to the targeted site. The structural models for these ligands in the Chk1 ATP-binding site will facilitate further medicinal chemistry efforts targeting this kinase.</p>

<p>Subclass B1 beta-lactamases are Zn(II)-dependent hydrolases that confer bacterial resistance to most clinically useful beta-lactam antibiotics. The enzyme BcII from Bacillus cereus is a prototypical enzyme that belongs to this group, the first Zn(II)-dependent beta-lactamase to be discovered. Crucial aspects of the BcII catalytic mechanism and metal binding mode have been assessed mostly on the Co(II)-substituted surrogate. Here we report a high-resolution structure of Co(II)-BcII, revealing a metal coordination geometry identical to that of the native zinc enzyme. In addition, a high-resolution structure of the apoenzyme, together with structures with different degrees of metal occupancy and oxidation levels of a conserved Cys ligand, discloses a considerable mobility of two loops containing four metal ligands (namely, regions His116-Arg121 and Gly219-Cys221). This flexibility is expected to assist in the structural rearrangement of the metal sites during catalytic turnover, which, along with the coordination geometry adaptability of Zn(II) ions, grants the interaction with a variety of substrates, a characteristic feature of B1 metallo-beta-lactamases.</p>

<p>In the crystalline state, ribonuclease T1 binds calcium ions at different lattice-dependent positions. In solution, its conformational stability is also remarkably increased in the presence of divalent metal ions. Combining urea unfolding studies and X-ray crystallography, we compared the presence of several metal ions at specific sites in the protein to their contribution to the overall stabilizing effect in solution. We constructed thermodynamic cycles involving particular metal ions and specific carboxylate functions. The resulting coupling energies indicate that some (but not all) metal ions found at lattice contacts in crystal structures may indeed significantly contribute to stability enhancement in the presence of metal ions in solution.</p>

<p>p38 inhibitors based on 3,4-dihydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidazin-2-one template were synthesized and their SAR explored. Benchmark compounds 30, 35, and 36 were found to be potent against the enzyme. Crystal structure of p38 in complex with 30 indicated a key pi-stacking interaction with the pendant tyrosine residue-35 in the glycine-rich loop.</p>

<p>Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is produced in the lung during allergic inflammation and asthma, and inhibition of enzymatic activity has been considered as a therapeutic strategy. However, most chitinase inhibitors are nonselective, additionally inhibiting chitotriosidase activity. Here, we describe bisdionin F, a competitive AMCase inhibitor with 20-fold selectivity for AMCase over chitotriosidase, designed by utilizing the AMCase crystal structure and dicaffeine scaffold. In a murine model of allergic inflammation, bisdionin F-treatment attenuated chitinase activity and alleviated the primary features of allergic inflammation including eosinophilia. However, selective AMCase inhibition by bisdionin F also caused dramatic and unexpected neutrophilia in the lungs. This class of inhibitor will be a powerful tool to dissect the functions of mammalian chitinases in disease and represents a synthetically accessible scaffold to optimize inhibitory properties in terms of airway inflammation.</p>

Here, we describe bisdionin F, a competitive AMCase inhibitor with 20-fold selectivity for AMCase over chitotriosidase, designed by utilizing the AMCase crystal structure and dicaffeine scaffold. In a murine model of allergic inflammation, bisdionin F-treatment attenuated chitinase activity and alleviated the primary features of allergic inflammation including eosinophilia. However, selective AMCase inhibition by bisdionin F also caused dramatic and unexpected neutrophilia in the lungs. This class of inhibitor will be a powerful tool to dissect the functions of mammalian chitinases in disease and represents a synthetically accessible scaffold to optimize inhibitory properties in terms of airway inflammation.</p>

<p>The role of the evolutionarily conserved residue Cys10 in Ochrobactrum anthropi glutathione transferase (OaGST) has been examined by replacing it with an alanine. A double mutant C10A/S11A was also prepared. The effect of the replacements on the coniugating and thiotransferase activities, and on the thermal and chemical stability of the enzyme was analyzed. Our data support the view that in OaGST, in contrast with other beta class GSTs that display significant differences in the glutathione-binding site, Cys10 is a key residue for glutathione coniugating activity. Furthermore, analysis of the OaGST-Cys10Ala structure, crystallized in the presence of glutathione, reveals that this mutation causes a switch between the high-affinity G-site and a low-affinity H-site where hydrophobic cosubstrates bind and where we observe the presence of an unexpected glutathione.</p>

<p>We report the crystallographic structures of the potent phosphoantigens Phosphostim (the bromohydrin of isopentenyl pyrophosphate) and E-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate bound to the mevalonate pathway enzyme isopentenyl pyrophosphate/dimethylallyl pyrophosphate isomerase (IPPI). Racemic Phosphostim forms covalent complexes with IPPI: a 4-thioether with C67 and a 4-ester with E116. Only the E116 ester forms with the chiral species, S-Phosphostim, with the w.t. enzyme, while the C67 thioether forms with a mutant Y104F IPPI. The potent phosphoantigen HMBPP also binds to IPPI, but is only a weak ( approximately 50 muM) inhibitor. These results strongly support an SN2 reaction for inhibition of IPPI by Phosphostim, in contrast to the SN1 or concerted type of reaction found with epoxide inhibitors, which react at C-3, and are of general interest in the context of the development of novel mevalonate pathway inhibitors. They also provide clues as to the nature of the binding site of synthetic phosphoantigens in gammadelta T cell activation. In particular, both bromohydrin and epoxy phosphoantigens are potent, irreversible inhibitors of IPPI while HMBPP is only a weak inhibitor, ruling out an IPPI or IPPI-like target for HMBPP in gammadelta T cell activation.</p>

<p>Ehrlich's pioneering chemotherapeutic experiments published in 1904 (Ehrlich, P., and Shiga, K. (1904) Berlin Klin. Wochenschrift 20, 329-362) described the efficacy of a series of dye molecules including trypan blue and trypan red to eliminate trypanosome infections in mice. The molecular structures of the dyes provided a starting point for the synthesis of suramin, which was developed and used as a trypanocidal drug in 1916 and is still in clinical use. Despite the biological importance of these dye-like molecules, the mode of action on trypanosomes has remained elusive. Here we present crystal structures of suramin and three related dyes in complex with pyruvate kinases from Leishmania mexicana or from Trypanosoma cruzi. The phenyl sulfonate groups of all four molecules (suramin, Ponceau S, acid blue 80, and benzothiazole-2,5-disulfonic acid) bind in the position of ADP/ATP at the active sites of the pyruvate kinases (PYKs). The binding positions in the two different trypanosomatid PYKs are nearly identical. We show that suramin competitively inhibits PYKs from humans (muscle, tumor, and liver isoenzymes, K(i) = 1.1-17 μM), T. cruzi (K(i) = 108 μM), and L. mexicana (K(i) = 116 μM), all of which have similar active sites. Synergistic effects were observed when examining suramin inhibition in the presence of an allosteric effector molecule, whereby IC(50) values decreased up to 2-fold for both trypanosomatid and human PYKs. These kinetic and structural analyses provide insight into the promiscuous inhibition observed for suramin and into the mode of action of the dye-like molecules used in Ehrlich's original experiments.</p>

<p>The transient opening of a backdoor in the active-site wall of acetylcholinesterase, one of nature's most rapid enzymes, has been suggested to contribute to the efficient traffic of substrates and products. A crystal structure of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase in complex with the peripheral-site inhibitor aflatoxin is now presented, in which a tyrosine at the bottom of the active-site gorge rotates to create a 3.4-Å wide exit channel. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the opening can be further enlarged by movement of Trp84. The crystallographic and molecular dynamics simulation data thus point to the interface between Tyr442 and Trp84 as the key element of a backdoor, whose opening permits rapid clearance of catalysis products from the active site. Furthermore, the crystal structure presented provides a novel template for rational design of inhibitors and reactivators, including anti-Alzheimer drugs and antidotes against organophosphate poisoning.</p>

<p>Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin, Cbl) is essential to the function of two human enzymes, methionine synthase (MS) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT). The conversion of dietary Cbl to its cofactor forms, methyl-Cbl (MeCbl) for MS and adenosyl-Cbl (AdoCbl) for MUT, located in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively, requires a complex pathway of intracellular processing and trafficking. One of the processing proteins, MMAA (methylmalonic aciduria type A), is implicated in the mitochondrial assembly of AdoCbl into MUT and is defective in children from the cblA complementation group of cobalamin disorders. To characterize the functional interplay between MMAA and MUT, we have crystallized human MMAA in the GDP-bound form and human MUT in the apo, holo, and substrate-bound ternary forms. Structures of both proteins reveal highly conserved domain architecture and catalytic machinery for ligand binding, yet they show substantially different dimeric assembly and interaction, compared with their bacterial counterparts. We show that MMAA exhibits GTPase activity that is modulated by MUT and that the two proteins interact in vitro and in vivo. Formation of a stable MMAA-MUT complex is nucleotide-selective for MMAA (GMPPNP over GDP) and apoenzyme-dependent for MUT. The physiological importance of this interaction is highlighted by a recently identified homoallelic patient mutation of MMAA, G188R, which, we show, retains basal GTPase activity but has abrogated interaction. Together, our data point to a gatekeeping role for MMAA by favoring complex formation with MUT apoenzyme for AdoCbl assembly and releasing the AdoCbl-loaded holoenzyme from the complex, in a GTP-dependent manner.</p>

<p>Heme enzymes are ubiquitous in biology and catalyze a vast array of biological redox processes. The formation of high valent ferryl intermediates of the heme iron (known as Compounds I and Compound II) is implicated for a number of catalytic heme enzymes, but these species are formed only transiently and thus have proved somewhat elusive. In consequence, there has been conflicting evidence as to the nature of these ferryl intermediates in a number of different heme enzymes, in particular the precise nature of the bond between the heme iron and the bound oxygen atom. In this work, we present high resolution crystal structures of both Compound I and Compound II intermediates in two different heme peroxidase enzymes, cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, allowing direct and accurate comparison of the bonding interactions in the different intermediates. A consistent picture emerges across all structures, showing lengthening of the ferryl oxygen bond (and presumed protonation) on reduction of Compound I to Compound II. These data clarify long standing inconsistencies on the nature of the ferryl heme species in these intermediates.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of recombinant Streptomyces rubiginosus D-xylose isomerase (D-xylose keto-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.5) solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement technique has been refined to R = 0.16 at 1.64 A resolution. As observed in an earlier study at 4.0 A (Carrell et al., J. Biol. Chem. 259: 3230-3236, 1984), xylose isomerase is a tetramer composed of four identical subunits. The monomer consists of an eight-stranded parallel beta-barrel surrounded by eight helices with an extended C-terminal tail that provides extensive contacts with a neighboring monomer. The active site pocket is defined by an opening in the barrel whose entrance is lined with hydrophobic residues while the bottom of the pocket consists mainly of glutamate, aspartate, and histidine residues coordinated to two manganese ions. The structures of the enzyme in the presence of MnCl2, the inhibitor xylitol, and the substrate D-xylose in the presence and absence of MnCl2 have also been refined to R = 0.14 at 1.60 A, R = 0.15 at 1.71 A, R = 0.15 at 1.60 A, and R = 0.14 at 1.60 A, respectively. Both the ring oxygen of the cyclic alpha-D-xylose and its C1 hydroxyl are within hydrogen bonding distance of NE2 of His-54 in the structure crystallized in the presence of D-xylose. Both the inhibitor, xylitol, and the extended form of the substrate, D-xylose, bind such that the C2 and C4 OH groups interact with one of the two divalent cations found in the active site and the C1 OH with the other cation. The remainder of the OH groups hydrogen bond with neighboring amino acid side chains. A detailed mechanism for D-xylose isomerase is proposed. Upon binding of cyclic alpha-D-xylose to xylose isomerase, His-54 acts as the catalytic base in a ring opening reaction. The ring opening step is followed by binding of D-xylose, involving two divalent cations, in an extended conformation. The isomerization of D-xylose to D-xylulose involves a metal-mediated 1,2-hydride shift. The final step in the mechanism is a ring closure to produce alpha-D-xylulose. The ring closing is the reverse of the ring opening step. This mechanism accounts for the majority of xylose isomerase's biochemical properties, including (1) the lack of solvent exchange between the 2-position of D-xylose and the 1-pro-R position of D-xylulose, (2) the chemical modification of histidine and lysine, (3) the pH vs. activity profile, and (4) the requirement for two divalent cations in the mechanism.</p>

<p>The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5b protein is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase essential for replication of the viral RNA genome. In vitro and presumably in vivo, NS5b initiates RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism. Different structural elements of NS5b have been reported to participate in RNA synthesis, especially a so-called "β-flap" and a C-terminal segment (designated "linker") that connects the catalytic core of NS5b to a transmembrane anchor. High concentrations of GTP have also been shown to stimulate de novo RNA synthesis by HCV NS5b. Here we describe a combined structural and functional analysis of genotype 1 HCV-NS5b of strains H77 (subtype 1a), for which no structure has been previously reported, and J4 (subtype 1b). Our results highlight the linker as directly involved in lifting the first boundary to processive RNA synthesis, the formation of the first dinucleotide primer. The transition from this first dinucleotide primer state to processive RNA synthesis requires removal of the linker and of the β-flap with which it is shown to strongly interact in crystal structures of HCV NS5b. We find that GTP specifically stimulates this transition irrespective of its incorporation in neosynthesized RNA.</p>

<p>The potent new antiviral inhibitor GRL-98065 (1) of HIV-1 protease (PR) has been studied with PR variants containing the single mutations D30N, I50V, V82A, and I84V that provide resistance to the major clinical inhibitors. Compound 1 had inhibition constants of 17-fold, 8-fold, 3-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, for PR(D30N), PR(I50V), PR(V82A), and PR(I84V) relative to wild type PR. The chemically related darunavir had similar relative inhibition, except for PR(D30N), where inhibitor 1 was approximately 3-fold less potent. The high resolution (1.11-1.60 Angstrom) crystal structures of PR mutant complexes with inhibitor 1 showed small changes relative to the wild type enzyme. PR(D30N) and PR(V82A) showed compensating interactions with inhibitor 1 relative to those of PR, while reduced hydrophobic contacts were observed with PR(I50V) and PR(I84V). Importantly, inhibitor 1 complexes showed fewer changes relative to wild type enzyme than reported for darunavir complexes. Therefore, inhibitor 1 is a valuable addition to the antiviral inhibitors with high potency against resistant strains of HIV.</p>

<p>Sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) is an essential membrane enzyme, functioning at the central junction of respiration, glycolysis, and phospholipid biosynthesis. Its critical role is indicated by the multitiered regulatory mechanisms that stringently controls its expression and function. Once expressed, GlpD activity is regulated through lipid-enzyme interactions in Escherichia coli. Here, we report seven previously undescribed structures of the fully active E. coli GlpD, up to 1.75 A resolution. In addition to elucidating the structure of the native enzyme, we have determined the structures of GlpD complexed with substrate analogues phosphoenolpyruvate, glyceric acid 2-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and product, dihydroxyacetone phosphate. These structural results reveal conformational states of the enzyme, delineating the residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis at the glycerol-3-phosphate site. Two probable mechanisms for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of glycerol-3-phosphate are envisioned, based on the conformational states of the complexes. To further correlate catalytic dehydrogenation to respiration, we have additionally determined the structures of GlpD bound with ubiquinone analogues menadione and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, identifying a hydrophobic plateau that is likely the ubiquinone-binding site. These structures illuminate probable mechanisms of catalysis and suggest how GlpD shuttles electrons into the respiratory pathway. Glycerol metabolism has been implicated in insulin signaling and perturbations in glycerol uptake and catabolism are linked to obesity in humans. Homologs of GlpD are found in practically all organisms, from prokaryotes to humans, with &gt;45% consensus protein sequences, signifying that these structural results on the prokaryotic enzyme may be readily applied to the eukaryotic GlpD enzymes.</p>

<p>UMP synthase (UMPS) catalyzes the last two steps of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis and is a potential cancer drug target. The C-terminal domain of UMPS is orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPD), a cofactor-less yet extremely efficient enzyme. Studies of OMPDs from micro-organisms led to the proposal of several noncovalent decarboxylation mechanisms via high-energy intermediates. We describe nine crystal structures of human OMPD in complex with substrate, product, and nucleotide inhibitors. Unexpectedly, simple compounds can replace the natural nucleotides and induce a closed conformation of OMPD, defining a tripartite catalytic site. The structures outline the requirements drugs must meet to maximize therapeutic effects and minimize cross-species activity. Chemical mimicry by iodide identified a CO(2) product binding site. Plasticity of catalytic residues and a covalent OMPD-UMP complex prompt a reevaluation of the prevailing decarboxylation mechanism in favor of covalent intermediates. This mechanism can also explain the observed catalytic promiscuity of OMPD.</p>

<p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are critical in the control of gene expression, and dysregulation of their activity has been implicated in a broad range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) employing different zinc chelating functionalities such as hydroxamic acids and benzamides have shown promising results in cancer therapy. Although it has also been suggested that HDACi with increased isozyme selectivity and potency may broaden their clinical utility and minimize side effects, the translation of this idea to the clinic remains to be investigated. Moreover, a detailed understanding of how HDACi with different pharmacological properties affect biological functions in vitro and in vivo is still missing. Here, we show that a panel of benzamide-containing HDACi are slow tight-binding inhibitors with long residence times unlike the hydroxamate-containing HDACi vorinostat and trichostatin-A. Characterization of changes in H2BK5 and H4K14 acetylation following HDACi treatment in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y revealed that the timing and magnitude of histone acetylation mirrored both the association and dissociation kinetic rates of the inhibitors. In contrast, cell viability and microarray gene expression analysis indicated that cell death induction and changes in transcriptional regulation do not correlate with the dissociation kinetic rates of the HDACi. Therefore, our study suggests that determining how the selective and kinetic inhibition properties of HDACi affect cell function will help to evaluate their therapeutic utility. </p>

<p>The meta-cleavage product (MCP) hydrolases utilize a Ser-His-Asp triad to hydrolyze a carbon-carbon bond. Hydrolysis of the MCP substrate has been proposed to proceed via an enol-to-keto tautomerization followed by a nucleophilic mechanism of catalysis. Ketonization involves an intermediate, ES(red), which possesses a remarkable bathochromically shifted absorption spectrum. We investigated the catalytic mechanism of the MCP hydrolases using DxnB2 from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1. Pre-steady-state kinetic and LC ESI/MS evaluation of the DxnB2-mediated hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid to 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid and benzoate support a nucleophilic mechanism catalysis. In DxnB2, the rate of ES(red) decay and product formation showed a solvent kinetic isotope effect of 2.5, indicating that a proton transfer reaction, assigned here to substrate ketonization, limits the rate of acylation. For a series of substituted MCPs, this rate was linearly dependent on MCP pKa2 (βnuc ∼ 1). Structural characterization of DxnB2 S105A:MCP complexes revealed that the catalytic histidine is displaced upon substrate-binding. The results provide evidence for enzyme-catalyzed ketonization in which the catalytic His-Asp pair does not play an essential role. The data further suggest that ES(red) represents a dianionic intermediate that acts as a general base to activate the serine nucleophile. This substrate-assisted mechanism of nucleophilic catalysis distinguishes MCP hydrolases from other serine hydrolases. </p>

<p>Thiolases are CoA-dependent enzymes which catalyze the formation of a carbon-carbon bond in a Claisen condensation step and its reverse reaction via a thiolytic degradation mechanism. Mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thiolase (T2) is important in the pathways for the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies as well as for the degradation of 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA. Human T2 deficiency has been identified in more than 60 patients. A unique property of T2 is its activation by potassium ions. High-resolution human T2 crystal structures are reported for the apo form and the CoA complex, with and without a bound potassium ion. The potassium ion is bound near the CoA binding site and the catalytic site. Binding of the potassium ion at this low-affinity binding site causes the rigidification of a CoA binding loop and an active site loop. Unexpectedly, a high-affinity binding site for a chloride ion has also been identified. The chloride ion is copurified, and its binding site is at the dimer interface, near two catalytic loops. A unique property of T2 is its ability to use 2-methyl-branched acetoacetyl-CoA as a substrate, whereas the other structurally characterized thiolases cannot utilize the 2-methylated compounds. The kinetic measurements show that T2 can degrade acetoacetyl-CoA and 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA with similar catalytic efficiencies. For both substrates, the turnover numbers increase approximately 3-fold when the potassium ion concentration is increased from 0 to 40 mM KCl. The structural analysis of the active site of T2 indicates that the Phe325-Pro326 dipeptide near the catalytic cavity is responsible for the exclusive 2-methyl-branched substrate specificity.</p>

<p>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), due to their good efficacy in the treatment of pain, inflammation, and fever, are among the most prescribed class of medicines in the world. The main drawback of NSAIDs is that they induce gastric complications such as peptic ulceration and injury to the intestine. Four NSAIDs, indomethacin, diclofenac, aspirin, and ibuprofen were selected to induce gastropathy in mouse models. It was found that the addition of C-terminal half of bovine lactoferrin (C-lobe) reversed the NSAID-induced injuries to the extent of 47-70% whereas the coadministration of C-lobe prevented it significantly. The C-lobe was prepared proteolytically using serine proteases. The binding studies of C-lobe with NSAIDs showed that these compounds bind to C-lobe with affinities ranging from 2.6 to 4.8 x 10(-4) M. The complexes of C-lobe were prepared with the above four NSAIDs. All four complexes were crystallized and their detailed three-dimensional structures were determined using x-ray crystallographic method. The structures showed that all the four NSAID molecules bound to C-lobe at the newly identified ligand binding site in C-lobe that is formed involving two alpha-helices, alpha10 and alpha11. The ligand binding site is separated from the well known iron binding site by the longest and the most stable beta-strand, betaj, in the structure. Similar results were also obtained with the full length lactoferrin molecule. This novel, to our knowledge, binding site in C-lobe of lactoferrin shows a good complementarity for the acidic and lipophilic compounds such as NSAIDs. We believe this indicates that C-lobe of lactoferrin can be exploited for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastropathy.</p>

<p>Protein evolvability includes two elements--robustness (or neutrality, mutations having no effect) and innovability (mutations readily inducing new functions). How are these two conflicting demands bridged? Does the ability to bridge them relate to the observation that certain folds, such as TIM barrels, accommodate numerous functions, whereas other folds support only one? Here, we hypothesize that the key to innovability is polarity--an active site composed of flexible, loosely packed loops alongside a well-separated, highly ordered scaffold. We show that highly stabilized variants of TEM-1 β-lactamase exhibit selective rigidification of the enzyme's scaffold while the active-site loops maintained their conformational plasticity. Polarity therefore results in stabilizing, compensatory mutations not trading off, but instead promoting the acquisition of new activities. Indeed, computational analysis indicates that in folds that accommodate only one function throughout evolution, for example, dihydrofolate reductase, ≥ 60% of the active-site residues belong to the scaffold. In contrast, folds associated with multiple functions such as the TIM barrel show high scaffold-active-site polarity (~20% of the active site comprises scaffold residues) and &gt;2-fold higher rates of sequence divergence at active-site positions. Our work suggests structural measures of fold polarity that appear to be correlated with innovability, thereby providing new insights regarding protein evolution, design, and engineering.</p>

<p>Phytochromes are red-light photoreceptors that regulate light responses in plants, fungi, and bacteria by means of reversible photoconversion between red (Pr) and far-red (Pfr) light-absorbing states. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Q188L mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome (PaBphP) photosensory core module, which exhibits altered photoconversion behavior and different crystal packing from wild type. We observe two distinct chromophore conformations in the Q188L crystal structure that we identify with the Pfr and Pr states. The Pr/Pfr compositions, varying from crystal to crystal, seem to correlate with light conditions under which the Q188L crystals are cryoprotected. We also compare all known Pr and Pfr structures. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identify residues that are involved in stabilizing the 15Ea (Pfr) and 15Za (Pr) configurations of the biliverdin chromophore. Specifically, Ser-261 appears to be essential to form a stable Pr state in PaBphP, possibly by means of its interaction with the propionate group of ring C. We propose a "flip-and-rotate" model that summarizes the major conformational differences between the Pr and Pfr states of the chromophore and its binding pocket.</p>

<p>Bisphosphonates (BPs) are a class of compounds that have been used extensively in the treatment of osteoporosis and malignancy-related hypercalcemia. Some of these compounds act through inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), a key enzyme in the synthesis of isoprenoids. Recently, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) used in bone resorption therapy have been shown to be active against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), suggesting that they may be used as anti-trypanosomal agents. The crystal structures of TcFPPS in complex with substrate (isopentenyl diphosphate, IPP) and five N-BP inhibitors show that the C-1 hydroxyl and the nitrogen-containing groups of the inhibitors alter the binding of IPP and the conformation of two TcFPPS residues, Tyr94 and Gln167. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments suggest that binding of the first N-BPs to the homodimeric TcFPPS changes the binding properties of the second site. This mechanism of binding of N-BPs to TcFPPS is different to that reported for the binding of the same compounds to human FPPS. Proteins 2010. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>

<p>Altered inositol metabolism is implicated in a number of diabetic complications. The first committed step in mammalian inositol catabolism is performed by myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), which catalyzes a unique four-electron dioxygen-dependent ring cleavage of myo-inositol to D-glucuronate. Here, we present the crystal structure of human MIOX in complex with myo-inosose-1 bound in a terminal mode to the MIOX diiron cluster site. Furthermore, from biochemical and biophysical results from N-terminal deletion mutagenesis we show that the N terminus is important, through coordination of a set of loops covering the active site, in shielding the active site during catalysis. EPR spectroscopy of the unliganded enzyme displays a two-component spectrum that we can relate to an open and a closed active site conformation. Furthermore, based on site-directed mutagenesis in combination with biochemical and biophysical data, we propose a novel role for Lys(127) in governing access to the diiron cluster.</p>

Binding of the potassium ion at this low-affinity binding site causes the rigidification of a CoA binding loop and an active site loop. Unexpectedly, a high-affinity binding site for a chloride ion has also been identified. The chloride ion is copurified, and its binding site is at the dimer interface, near two catalytic loops. A unique property of T2 is its ability to use 2-methyl-branched acetoacetyl-CoA as a substrate, whereas the other structurally characterized thiolases cannot utilize the 2-methylated compounds. The kinetic measurements show that T2 can degrade acetoacetyl-CoA and 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA with similar catalytic efficiencies. For both substrates, the turnover numbers increase approximately 3-fold when the potassium ion concentration is increased from 0 to 40 mM KCl. The structural analysis of the active site of T2 indicates that the Phe325-Pro326 dipeptide near the catalytic cavity is responsible for the exclusive 2-methyl-branched substrate specificity.</p>

<p>In the sarcomeric M-band, the giant ruler proteins titin and obscurin, its small homologue obscurin-like-1 (obsl1), and the myosin cross-linking protein myomesin form a ternary complex that is crucial for the function of the M-band as a mechanical link. Mutations in the last titin immunoglobulin (Ig) domain M10, which interacts with the N-terminal Ig-domains of obscurin and obsl1, lead to hereditary muscle diseases. The M10 domain is unusual not only in that it is a frequent target of disease-linked mutations, but also in that it is the only currently known muscle Ig-domain that interacts with two ligands--obscurin and obsl1--in different sarcomeric subregions. Using x-ray crystallography, we show the structural basis for titin M10 interaction with obsl1 in a novel antiparallel Ig-Ig architecture and unravel the molecular basis of titin-M10 linked myopathies. The severity of these pathologies correlates with the disruption of the titin-obsl1/obscurin complex. Conserved signature residues at the interface account for differences in affinity that direct the cellular sorting in cardiomyocytes. By engineering the interface signature residues of obsl1 to obscurin, and vice versa, their affinity for titin can be modulated similar to the native proteins. In single-molecule force-spectroscopy experiments, both complexes yield at forces of around 30 pN, much lower than those observed for the mechanically stable Z-disk complex of titin and telethonin, suggesting why even moderate weakening of the obsl1/obscurin-titin links has severe consequences for normal muscle functions.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major infectious disease that accounts for over 1.7 million deaths every year. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, enters the human host by the inhalation of infectious aerosols. Additionally, one third of the world's population is likely to be infected with latent TB. The incidence of TB is on the rise owing in part to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. As a result, there is a growing need to focus on novel M. tuberculosis enzyme targets. M. tuberculosis triosephosphate isomerase (MtTPI) is an essential enzyme for gluconeogenetic pathways, making it a potential target for future therapeutics. In order to determine its structure, the X-ray crystal structure of MtTPI has been determined, as well as that of MtTPI bound with a reaction-intermediate analog. As a result, two forms of the active site were revealed. In conjunction with the kinetic parameters obtained for the MtTPI-facilitated conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (D-GAP), this provides a greater structural and biochemical understanding of this enzyme. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine the binding constant for a reaction-intermediate analog bound to the active site of MtTPI.</p>

<p>In Escherichia coli, the pseudouridine synthase RsuA catalyzes formation of pseudouridine (psi) at position 516 in 16S rRNA during assembly of the 30S ribosomal subunit. We have determined the crystal structure of RsuA bound to uracil at 2.0 A resolution and to uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) at 2.65 A resolution. RsuA consists of an N-terminal domain connected by an extended linker to the central and C-terminal domains. Uracil and UMP bind in a cleft between the central and C-terminal domains near the catalytic residue Asp 102. The N-terminal domain shows structural similarity to the ribosomal protein S4. Despite only 15% amino acid identity, the other two domains are structurally similar to those of the tRNA-specific psi-synthase TruA, including the position of the catalytic Asp. Our results suggest that all four families of pseudouridine synthases share the same fold of their catalytic domain(s) and uracil-binding site.</p>

<p>Photoactive analogs of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) are useful probes in studies of enzymes that employ this molecule as a substrate. Here, we describe the preparation and properties of two new FPP analogs that contain diazotrifluoropropanoyl photophores linked to geranyl diphosphate via amide or ester linkages. The amide-linked analog (3) was synthesized in 32P-labeled form from geraniol in seven steps. Experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein farnesyltransferase (ScPFTase) showed that 3 is an alternative substrate for the enzyme. Photolysis experiments with [(32)P]3 demonstrate that this compound labels the beta-subunits of both farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase (types 1 and 2). However, the amide-linked probe 3 undergoes a rearrangement to a photochemically unreactive isomeric triazolone upon long term storage making it inconvenient to use. To address this stability issue, the ester-linked analog 4 was prepared in six steps from geraniol. Computational analysis and X-ray crystallographic studies suggest that 4 binds to protein farnesyl transferase (PFTase) in a similar fashion as FPP. Compound 4 is also an alternative substrate for PFTase, and a 32P-labeled form selectively photocrosslinks the beta-subunit of ScPFTase as well as E. coli farnesyldiphosphate synthase and a germacrene-producing sesquiterpene synthase from Nostoc sp. strain PCC7120 (a cyanobacterial source). Finally, nearly exclusive labeling of ScPFTase in crude E. coli extract was observed, suggesting that [32P]4 manifests significant selectivity and should hence be useful for identifying novel FPP-utilizing enzymes in crude protein preparations.</p>

<p>For nearly 60 years, the ATP activation and the CTP inhibition of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) has been the textbook example of allosteric regulation. We present kinetic data and five X-ray structures determined in the absence and presence of a Mg(2+) concentration within the physiological range. In the presence of 2 mM divalent cations (Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Zn(2+)), CTP does not significantly inhibit the enzyme, while the allosteric activation by ATP is enhanced. The data suggest that the actual allosteric inhibitor of ATCase in vivo is the combination of CTP, UTP, and a divalent cation, and the actual allosteric activator is a divalent cation with ATP or ATP and GTP. The structural data reveals that two NTPs can bind to each allosteric site with a divalent cation acting as a bridge between the triphosphates. Thus, the regulation of ATCase is far more complex than previously believed and calls many previous studies into question. The X-ray structures reveal that the catalytic chains undergo essentially no alternations; however, several regions of the regulatory chains undergo significant structural changes. Most significant is that the N-terminal region of the regulatory chains exists in different conformations in the allosterically activated and inhibited forms of the enzyme. Here, a new model of allosteric regulation is proposed. </p>

<p>Human pancreatic alpha-amylase (HPA) is a member of the alpha-amylase family involved in the degradation of starch. Some members of this family, including HPA, require chloride for maximal activity. To determine the mechanism of chloride activation, a series of mutants (R195A, R195Q, N298S, R337A, and R337Q) were made in which residues in the chloride ion binding site were replaced. Mutations in this binding site were found to severely affect the ability of HPA to bind chloride ions with no binding detected for the R195 and R337 mutant enzymes. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that these mutations did not result in significant structural changes. However, the introduction of these mutations did alter the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Mutations to residue R195 resulted in a 20-450-fold decrease in the activity of the enzyme toward starch and shifted the pH optimum to a more basic pH. Interestingly, replacement of R337 with a nonbasic amino acid resulted in an alpha-amylase that no longer required chloride for catalysis and has a pH profile similar to that of wild-type HPA. In contrast, a mutation at residue N298 resulted in an enzyme that had much lower binding affinity for chloride but still required chloride for maximal activity. We propose that the chloride is required to increase the pK(a) of the acid/base catalyst, E233, which would otherwise be lower due to the presence of R337, a positively charged residue.</p>

<p>Carbenes are highly reactive chemical compounds that are exploited as ligands in organometallic chemistry and are powerful organic catalysts. They were postulated to occur as transient intermediates in enzymes, yet their existence in a biological system could never be demonstrated directly. We present spectroscopic and structural data of a thiamin enzyme in a noncovalent complex with substrate, which implicate accumulation of a stable carbene as a major resonance contributor to deprotonated thiamin. </p>

<p>Protein phosphatase 1 occurs in all tissues and regulates many pathways, ranging from cell-cycle progression to carbohydrate metabolism. Many naturally occurring, molecular toxins modulate PP1 activity, though the exact mechanism of this differential regulation is not understood. A detailed elucidation of these interactions is crucial for understanding the cellular basis of phosphatase function and signaling pathways but, more importantly, they can serve as the basis for highly specific therapeutics, e.g. against cancer. We report the crystal structures of PP1 in complex with nodularin-R at 1.63 A and tautomycin at 1.70 A resolution. The PP1:nodularin-R complex was used to demonstrate the utility of our improved PP1 production technique, which produces highly active, soluble PP1. Tautomycin is one of the few toxins that reportedly preferentially binds PP1&gt;PP2A. Therefore, the PP1:tautomycin structure is the first complex structure with a toxin with preferred PP1 specificity. Furthermore, since tautomycin is a linear non-peptide-based toxin, our reported structure will aid the design of lead compounds for novel PP1-specific pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>Retroviral integrase (IN) is responsible for two consecutive reactions, which lead to insertion of a viral DNA copy into a host cell chromosome. Initially, the enzyme removes di- or trinucleotides from viral DNA ends to expose 3'-hydroxyls attached to the invariant CA dinucleotides (3'-processing reaction). Second, it inserts the processed 3'-viral DNA ends into host chromosomal DNA (strand transfer). Herein, we report a crystal structure of prototype foamy virus IN bound to viral DNA prior to 3'-processing. Furthermore, taking advantage of its dependence on divalent metal ion cofactors, we were able to freeze trap the viral enzyme in its ground states containing all the components necessary for 3'-processing or strand transfer. Our results shed light on the mechanics of retroviral DNA integration and explain why HIV IN strand transfer inhibitors are ineffective against the 3'-processing step of integration. The ground state structures moreover highlight a striking substrate mimicry utilized by the inhibitors in their binding to the IN active site and suggest ways to improve upon this clinically relevant class of small molecules.</p>

<p>Galactose mutarotase catalyzes the first step in normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of beta-D-galactose to alpha-D-galactose. The structure of the enzyme from Lactococcus lactis was recently solved in this laboratory and shown to be topologically similar to domain 5 of beta-galactosidase. From this initial X-ray analysis, four amino acid residues were demonstrated to be intimately involved in sugar binding to the protein: His 96, His 170, Asp 243, and Glu 304. Here we present a combined X-ray crystallographic and kinetic analysis designed to examine the role of these residues in the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. For this investigation, the following site-directed mutant proteins were prepared: H96N, H170N, D243N, D243A, E304Q, and E304A. All of the structures of these proteins, complexed with either glucose or galactose, were solved to a nominal resolution of 1.95 A or better, and their kinetic parameters were measured against D-galactose, D-glucose, L-arabinose, or D-xylose. From these studies, it can be concluded that Glu 304 and His 170 are critical for catalysis and that His 96 and Asp 243 are important for proper substrate positioning within the active site. Specifically, Glu 304 serves as the active site base to initiate the reaction by removing the proton from the C-1 hydroxyl group of the sugar substrate and His 170 functions as the active site acid to protonate the C-5 ring oxygen.</p>

<p>Protein kinase CK2 (CK2), a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase, is involved in a variety of roles essential to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Elevated levels of CK2 expression results in the dysregulation of key signaling pathways that regulate transcription, and has been implicated in cancer. The adenosine-5'-triphosphate-competitive inhibitor CX-4945 has been reported to show broad spectrum anti-proliferative activity in multiple cancer cell lines. Although the enzymatic IC(50) of CX-4945 has been reported, the thermodynamics and structural basis of binding to CK2α remained elusive. Presented here are the crystal structures of human CK2α in complex with CX-4945 and adenylyl phosphoramidate at 2.7 and 1.3 Å, respectively. Biophysical analysis of CX-4945 binding is also described. This data provides the structural rationale for the design of more potent inhibitors against this emerging cancer target.</p>

<p>Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of malaria, a potentially fatal blood disease affecting half a billion humans worldwide. These blood-feeding insects include in their antihemostatic arsenal a potent thrombin inhibitor, the flexible and cysteine-less anophelin. Here, we present a thorough structure-and-function analysis of thrombin inhibition by anophelin, including the 2.3-Å crystal structure of the human thrombin·anophelin complex. Anophelin residues 32-61 are well-defined by electron density, completely occupying the long cleft between the active site and exosite I. However, in striking contrast to substrates, the D50-R53 anophelin tetrapeptide occupies the active site cleft of the enzyme, whereas the upstream residues A35-P45 shield the regulatory exosite I, defining a unique reverse-binding mode of an inhibitor to the target proteinase. The extensive interactions established, the disruption of thrombin's active site charge-relay system, and the insertion of residue R53 into the proteinase S(1) pocket in an orientation opposed to productive substrates explain anophelin's remarkable specificity and resistance to proteolysis by thrombin. Complementary biophysical and functional characterization of point mutants and truncated versions of anophelin unambiguously establish the molecular mechanism of action of this family of serine proteinase inhibitors (I77). These findings have implications for the design of novel antithrombotics.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Cel44A, which is one of the enzymatic components of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum, was solved at a resolution of 0.96 A. This enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase family (GH family) 44. The structure reveals that Cel44A consists of a TIM-like barrel domain and a beta-sandwich domain. The wild-type and the E186Q mutant structures complexed with substrates suggest that two glutamic acid residues, Glu(186) and Glu(359), are the active residues of the enzyme. Biochemical experiments were performed to confirm this idea. The structural features indicate that GH family 44 belongs to clan GH-A and that the reaction catalyzed by Cel44A is retaining type hydrolysis. The stereochemical course of hydrolysis was confirmed by a (1)H NMR experiment using the reduced cellooligosaccharide as a substrate.</p>

<p>Formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase (FGAR-AT) catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM) from formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) and glutamine in the fourth step of the purine biosynthetic pathway. FGAR-AT is encoded by the purL gene. Two types of PurL have been detected. The first type, found in eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria, consists of a single 140 kDa polypeptide chain and is designated large PurL (lgPurL). The second type, small PurL (smPurL), is found in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria and consists of an 80 kDa polypeptide chain. SmPurL requires two additional gene products, PurQ and PurS, for activity. PurL is a member of a protein superfamily that contains a novel ATP-binding domain. Structures of several members of this superfamily are available in the unliganded form. We determined five different structures of FGAR-AT from Thermotoga maritima in the presence of substrates, a substrate analogue, and a product. These complexes have allowed a detailed description of the novel ATP-binding motif. The availability of a ternary complex enabled mapping of the active site, thus identifying potential residues involved in catalysis. The complexes show a conformational change in the active site compared to the unliganded structure. Surprising discoveries, an ATP molecule in an auxiliary site of the protein and the conformational changes associated with its binding, provoke speculation about the regulatory role of the auxiliary site in formation of the PurLSQ complex as well as the evolutionary relationship of PurLs from different organisms.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) from the eukaryotic parasites Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi provide a first structural view of a eukaryotic form of this enzyme and reveal differences from bacterial homologs. HisRSs in general contain an extra domain inserted between conserved motifs 2 and 3 of the Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase catalytic core. The current structures show that the three-dimensional topology of this domain is very different in bacterial and archaeal/eukaryotic forms of the enzyme. Comparison of apo and histidine-bound trypanosomal structures indicates substantial active-site rearrangement upon histidine binding but relatively little subsequent rearrangement after reaction of histidine with ATP to form the enzyme's first reaction product, histidyladenylate. The specific residues involved in forming the binding pocket for the adenine moiety differ substantially both from the previously characterized binding site in bacterial structures and from the homologous residues in human HisRSs. The essentiality of the single HisRS gene in T. brucei is shown by a severe depression of parasite growth rate that results from even partial suppression of expression by RNA interference.</p>

<p>Mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Superoxide dismutase-1 mutations decrease protein stability and promote aggregation. The mutant monomer is thought to be an intermediate in the pathway from the superoxide dismutase-1 dimer to aggregate. Here we find that the monomeric copper-apo, zinc-holo protein is structurally perturbed and the apo-protein aggregates without reattainment of the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Intervention to stabilize the superoxide dismutase-1 dimer and inhibit aggregation is regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy. We describe protein-ligand interactions for two compounds, Isoproterenol and 5-fluorouridine, highlighted as superoxide dismutase-1 stabilizers. We find both compounds interact with superoxide dismutase-1 at a key region identified at the core of the superoxide dismutase-1 fibrillar aggregates, β-barrel loop II-strand 3, rather than the proposed dimer interface site. This illustrates the need for direct structural observations when developing compounds for protein-targeted therapeutics.</p>

<p>The three-dimensional structure of the N-acyl-l-homoserine lactone hydrolase (AHL lactonase) from Bacillus thuringiensis has been determined, by using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing, to 1.6-angstroms resolution. AHLs are produced by many Gram-negative bacteria as signaling molecules used in quorum-sensing pathways that indirectly sense cell density and regulate communal behavior. Because of their importance in pathogenicity, quorum-sensing pathways have been suggested as potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics. Quorum-sensing can be disrupted by enzymes evolved to degrade these lactones, such as AHL lactonases. These enzymes are members of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily and contain two zinc ions in their active sites. The zinc ions are coordinated to a number of ligands, including a single oxygen of a bridging carboxylate and a bridging water/hydroxide ion, thought to be the nucleophile that hydrolyzes the AHLs to ring-opened products, which can no longer act as quorum signals.</p>

<p>The enzyme aldos-2-ulose dehydratase/isomerase (AUDH) participates in carbohydrate secondary metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of glucosone and 1,5-d-anhydrofructose to the secondary metabolites cortalcerone and microthecin, respectively. AUDH is a homo-dimeric enzyme with subunits of 900 amino acids. The subunit consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller domain, two cupin folds and a C-terminal lectin domain. AUDH contains a structural Zn(2+) and Mg(2+) located in loop regions and two zinc ions at the bottom of two putative active-site clefts in the propeller and the cupin domain, respectively. Catalysis is dependent on these two zinc ions, as their specific removal led to loss of enzymatic activity. The structure of the Zn(2)(+)-depleted enzyme is very similar to that of native AUDH, and structural changes upon metal removal as the cause for the catalytic deficiencies can be excluded. The complex with the reaction intermediate ascopyrone M shows binding of this compound at two different sites, with direct coordination to Zn(2+) in the propeller domain and as second sphere ligand of the metal ion in the cupin domain. These observations suggest that the two reactions of AUDH might be catalyzed in two different active sites, about 60 Å apart. The dehydration reaction most likely follows an elimination mechanism, where Zn(2+) acts as a Lewis acid polarizing the C2 keto group of 1,5-d-anhydrofructose. Abstraction of the proton at the C3 carbon atom and protonation of the leaving group, the C4 hydroxyl moiety, could potentially be catalyzed by the side chain of the suitably positioned residue His155.</p>

<p>Isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) is the third enzyme specific to leucine biosynthesis in microorganisms and plants, and catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of (2R,3S)-3-isopropylmalate to alpha-ketoisocaproate using NAD(+) as an oxidizing agent. In this study, a thia-analogue of the substrate was designed and synthesized as an inhibitor for IPMDH. The analogue showed strong competitive inhibitory activity with K(i)=62nM toward IPMDH derived from Thermus thermophilus. Moreover, the crystal structure of T. thermophilus IPMDH in a ternary complex with NAD(+) and the inhibitor has been determined at 2.8A resolution. The inhibitor exists as a decarboxylated product with an enol/enolate form in the active site. The product interacts with Arg 94, Asn 102, Ser 259, Glu 270, and a water molecule hydrogen-bonding with Arg 132. All interactions between the product and the enzyme were observed in the position associated with keto-enol tautomerization. This result implies that the tautomerization step of the thia-analogue during the IPMDH reaction is involved in the inhibition.</p>

<p>Whereas eubacterial and eukaryotic riboflavin synthases form homotrimers, archaeal riboflavin synthases from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Methanothermobacter thermoautrophicus are homopentamers with sequence similarity to the 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase catalyzing the penultimate step in riboflavin biosynthesis. Recently it could be shown that the complex dismutation reaction catalyzed by the pentameric M. jannaschii riboflavin synthase generates riboflavin with the same regiochemistry as observed for trimeric riboflavin synthases. Here we present crystal structures of the pentameric riboflavin synthase from M. jannaschii and its complex with the substrate analog inhibitor, 6,7-dioxo-8-ribityllumazine. The complex structure shows five active sites located between adjacent monomers of the pentamer. Each active site can accommodate two substrate analog molecules in anti-parallel orientation. The topology of the two bound ligands at the active site is well in line with the known stereochemistry of a pentacyclic adduct of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine that has been shown to serve as a kinetically competent intermediate. The pentacyclic intermediates of trimeric and pentameric riboflavin synthases are diastereomers.</p>

<p>The nucleoside hydrolase of Trypanosoma vivax hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic bond of purine nucleosides. Structural and kinetic studies on this enzyme have suggested a catalytic role for a flexible loop in the vicinity of the active sites. Here we present the analysis of the role of this flexible loop via the combination of a proline scan of the loop, loop deletion mutagenesis, steady state and pre-steady state analysis, and x-ray crystallography. Our analysis reveals that this loop has an important role in leaving group activation and product release. The catalytic role involves the entire loop and could only be perturbed by deletion of the entire loop and not by single site mutagenesis. We present evidence that the loop closes over the active site during catalysis, thereby ordering a water channel that is involved in leaving group activation. Once chemistry has taken place, the loop dynamics determine the rate of product release.</p>

<p>8-Oxopurines (8-oxodG and 8-oxodA) and formamidopyrimidines (FaPydG and FaPydA) are major oxidative DNA lesions involved in cancer development and aging. Their mutagenicity is believed to result from a conformational shift of the N9-C1' glycosidic bonds from anti to syn, which allows the lesions to form noncanonical Hoogsteen-type base pairs with incoming triphosphates during DNA replication. Here we present biochemical data and what are to our knowledge the first crystal structures of carbocyclic FaPydA and FaPydG containing DNA in complex with a high-fidelity polymerase. Crystallographic snapshots show that the cFaPy lesions keep the anti geometry of the glycosidic bond during error-free and error-prone replication. The observed dG·dC→dT·dA transversion mutations are the result of base shifting and tautomerization.</p>

<p>The crystal structures and inhibitor complexes of two industrially important ω-aminotransferase enzymes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Chromobacterium violaceum have been determined in order to understand the differences in their substrate specificity. The two enzymes share 30% sequence identity and use the same amino acceptor, pyruvate; however, the Pseudomonas enzyme shows activity towards the amino donor β-alanine, whilst the Chromobacterium enzyme does not. Both enzymes show activity towards S-α-methylbenzylamine (MBA), with the Chromobacterium enzyme having a broader substrate range. The crystal structure of the P. aeruginosa enzyme has been solved in the holo form and with the inhibitor gabaculine bound. The C. violaceum enzyme has been solved in the apo and holo forms and with gabaculine bound. The structures of the holo forms of both enzymes are quite similar. There is little conformational difference observed between the inhibitor complex and the holoenzyme for the P. aeruginosa aminotransferase. In comparison, the crystal structure of the C. violaceum gabaculine complex shows significant structural rearrangements from the structures of both the apo and holo forms of the enzyme. It appears that the different rigidity of the protein scaffold contributes to the substrate specificity observed for the two ω-aminotransferases.</p>

In comparison, the crystal structure of the C. violaceum gabaculine complex shows significant structural rearrangements from the structures of both the apo and holo forms of the enzyme. It appears that the different rigidity of the protein scaffold contributes to the substrate specificity observed for the two ω-aminotransferases.</p>

<p>The epsilon subunit of the Escherichia coli replicative DNA polymerase III is the proofreading 3'-5' exonuclease. Structures of its catalytic N-terminal domain (epsilon186) were determined at two pH values (5.8 and 8.5) at resolutions of 1.7-1.8 A, in complex with two Mn(II) ions and a nucleotide product of its reaction, thymidine 5'-monophosphate. The protein structure is built around a core five-stranded beta sheet that is a common feature of members of the DnaQ superfamily. The structures were identical, except for differences in the way TMP and water molecules are coordinated to the binuclear metal center in the active site. These data are used to develop a mechanism for epsilon and to produce a plausible model of the complex of epsilon186 with DNA.</p>

<p>Extreme drug resistant mutant of HIV-1 protease (PR) bearing 20 mutations (PR20) has been studied with the clinical inhibitor amprenavir (1) and two potent antiviral investigational inhibitors GRL-02031 (2) and GRL-0519 (3). Clinical inhibitors are &gt;1000-fold less active on PR20 than on wild-type enzyme, which is consistent with dissociation constants (KL) from isothermal titration calorimetry of 40 nM for 3, 178 nM for amprenavir, and 960 nM for 2. High resolution crystal structures of PR20-inhibitor complexes revealed altered interactions compared with the corresponding wild-type PR complexes in agreement with relative inhibition. Amprenavir lacks interactions due to PR20 mutations in the S2/S2' subsites relative to PR. Inhibitors 2 and 3 lose interactions with Arg8' in PR20 relative to the wild-type enzyme because Arg8' shifts to interact with mutated L10F side chain. Overall, inhibitor 3 compares favorably with darunavir in affinity for PR20 and shows promise for further development.</p>

<p>Glutamate 5-kinase (G5K) makes the highly unstable product glutamyl 5-phosphate (G5P) in the initial, controlling step of proline/ornithine synthesis, being feedback-inhibited by proline or ornithine, and causing, when defective, clinical hyperammonaemia. We determined two crystal structures of G5K from Escherichia coli, at 2.9 A and 2.5 A resolution, complexed with glutamate and sulphate, or with G5P, sulphate and the proline analogue 5-oxoproline. E. coli G5K presents a novel tetrameric (dimer of dimers) architecture. Each subunit contains a 257 residue AAK domain, typical of acylphosphate-forming enzymes, with characteristic alpha(3)beta(8)alpha(4) sandwich topology. This domain is responsible for catalysis and proline inhibition, and has a crater on the beta sheet C-edge that hosts the active centre and bound 5-oxoproline. Each subunit contains a 93 residue C-terminal PUA domain, typical of RNA-modifying enzymes, which presents the characteristic beta(5)beta(4) sandwich fold and three alpha helices. The AAK and PUA domains of one subunit associate non-canonically in the dimer with the same domains of the other subunit, leaving a negatively charged hole between them that hosts two Mg ions in one crystal, in line with the G5K requirement for free Mg. The tetramer, formed by two dimers interacting exclusively through their AAK domains, is flat and elongated, and has in each face, pericentrically, two exposed active centres in alternate subunits. This would permit the close apposition of two active centres of bacterial glutamate-5-phosphate reductase (the next enzyme in the proline/ornithine-synthesising route), supporting the postulated channelling of G5P. The structures clarify substrate binding and catalysis, justify the high glutamate specificity, explain the effects of known point mutations, and support the binding of proline near glutamate. Proline binding may trigger the movement of a loop that encircles glutamate, and which participates in a hydrogen bond network connecting active centres, which is possibly involved in the cooperativity for glutamate.</p>

<p>Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation is a post-translational protein modification implicated in the regulation of a range of cellular processes. A family of proteins that catalyse ADP-ribosylation reactions are the poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerases (PARPs). PARPs covalently attach an ADP-ribose nucleotide to target proteins and some PARP family members can subsequently add additional ADP-ribose units to generate a PAR chain. The hydrolysis of PAR chains is catalysed by PAR glycohydrolase (PARG). PARG is unable to cleave the mono(ADP-ribose) unit directly linked to the protein and although the enzymatic activity that catalyses this reaction has been detected in mammalian cell extracts, the protein(s) responsible remain unknown. Here, we report the homozygous mutation of the c6orf130 gene in patients with severe neurodegeneration, and identify C6orf130 as a PARP-interacting protein that removes mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation on glutamate amino acid residues in PARP-modified proteins. X-ray structures and biochemical analysis of C6orf130 suggest a mechanism of catalytic reversal involving a transient C6orf130 lysyl-(ADP-ribose) intermediate. Furthermore, depletion of C6orf130 protein in cells leads to proliferation and DNA repair defects. Collectively, our data suggest that C6orf130 enzymatic activity has a role in the turnover and recycling of protein ADP-ribosylation, and we have implicated the importance of this protein in supporting normal cellular function in humans.</p>

<p>Autoinducer inactivator A (AiiA) is a metal-dependent N-acyl homoserine lactone hydrolase that displays broad substrate specificity but shows a preference for substrates with long N-acyl substitutions. Previously, crystal structures of AiiA in complex with the ring-opened product N-hexanoyl-l-homoserine revealed binding interactions near the metal center but did not identify a binding pocket for the N-acyl chains of longer substrates. Here we report the crystal structure of an AiiA mutant, F107W, determined in the presence and absence of N-decanoyl-l-homoserine. F107 is located in a hydrophobic cavity adjacent to the previously identified ligand binding pocket, and the F107W mutation results in the formation of an unexpected interaction with the ring-opened product. Notably, the structure reveals a previously unidentified hydrophobic binding pocket for the substrate's N-acyl chain. Two aromatic residues, F64 and F68, form a hydrophobic clamp, centered around the seventh carbon in the product-bound structure's decanoyl chain, making an interaction that would also be available for longer substrates, but not for shorter substrates. Steady-state kinetics using substrates of various lengths with AiiA bearing mutations at the hydrophobic clamp, including insertion of a redox-sensitive cysteine pair, confirms the importance of this hydrophobic feature for substrate preference. Identifying the specificity determinants of AiiA will aid the development of more selective quorum-quenching enzymes as tools and as potential therapeutics.</p>

<p>Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) catalyzes the final step of the mevalonate pathway, the Mg(2+)-ATP dependent decarboxylation of mevalonate 5-diphosphate (MVAPP), producing isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Synthesis of IPP, an isoprenoid precursor molecule that is a critical intermediate in peptidoglycan and polyisoprenoid biosynthesis, is essential in Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus spp.), and thus the enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are ideal antimicrobial targets. MDD belongs to the GHMP superfamily of metabolite kinases that have been extensively studied for the past 50 years, yet the crystallization of GHMP kinase ternary complexes has proven to be difficult. To further our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of GHMP kinases with the purpose of developing broad spectrum antimicrobial agents that target the substrate and nucleotide binding sites, we report the crystal structures of wild-type and mutant (S192A and D283A) ternary complexes of Staphylococcus epidermidis MDD. Comparison of apo, MVAPP-bound, and ternary complex wild-type MDD provides structural information about the mode of substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. Structural characterization of ternary complexes of catalytically deficient MDD S192A and D283A (k(cat) decreased 10(3)- and 10(5)-fold, respectively) provides insight into MDD function. The carboxylate side chain of invariant Asp(283) functions as a catalytic base and is essential for the proper orientation of the MVAPP C3-hydroxyl group within the active site funnel. Several MDD amino acids within the conserved phosphate binding loop ("P-loop") provide key interactions, stabilizing the nucleotide triphosphoryl moiety. The crystal structures presented here provide a useful foundation for structure-based drug design.</p>

<p>We have determined the structure of the homotrimeric dUTPase from Escherichia coli, completed with an inhibitor and substrate analogue, dUDP. Three molecules of dUDP are found symmetrically bound per trimer, each in a shallow cleft between adjacent subunits, interacting with evolutionary conserved residues. The interactions of the uracil ring and the deoxypentose with the protein are consistent with the high specificity of the enzyme with respect to these groups. The positions of the two phosphate groups and adjacent water molecules are discussed in relation to the mechanism and kinetics of catalysis. The role that dUTPase plays in DNA metabolism makes the enzyme a potential target for chemotherapeutic drugs: the results presented here will aid in the design and development of inhibitory compounds.</p>

<p>Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) is a promising target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the process of structure based drug design for GP, a group of 15 aromatic aldehyde 4-(β-d-glucopyranosyl)thiosemicarbazones have been synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb) by kinetic studies. These compounds are competitive inhibitors of GPb with respect to α-d-glucose-1-phosphate with IC(50) values ranging from 5.7 to 524.3μM. In order to elucidate the structural basis of their inhibition, the crystal structures of these compounds in complex with GPb at 1.95-2.23Å resolution were determined. The complex structures reveal that the inhibitors are accommodated at the catalytic site with the glucopyranosyl moiety at approximately the same position as α-d-glucose and stabilize the T conformation of the 280s loop. The thiosemicarbazone part of the studied glucosyl thiosemicarbazones possess a moiety derived from substituted benzaldehydes with NO(2), F, Cl, Br, OH, OMe, CF(3), or Me at the ortho-, meta- or para-position of the aromatic ring as well as a moiety derived from 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde. These fit tightly into the β-pocket, a side channel from the catalytic site with no access to the bulk solvent. The differences in their inhibitory potency can be interpreted in terms of variations in the interactions of the aldehyde-derived moiety with protein residues in the β-pocket. In addition, 14 out of the 15 studied inhibitors were found bound at the new allosteric site of the enzyme.</p>

<p>In the search of molecules that could recognize sizeable areas of protein surfaces, a series of ten helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers was synthesized on solid phase. The foldamers comprise three to five monomers carrying various proteinogenic side chains, and exist as racemic mixtures of interconverting right-handed and left-handed helices. Functionalization of the foldamers by a nanomolar ligand of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA) ensured that they would be held in close proximity to the protein surface. Foldamer-protein interactions were screened by circular dichroism (CD). One foldamer displayed intense CD bands indicating that a preferred helix handedness is induced upon interacting with the protein surface. The crystal structure of the complex between this foldamer and HCA could be resolved at 2.1 Å resolution and revealed a number of unanticipated protein-foldamer, foldamer-foldamer, and protein-protein interactions.</p>

<p>F1 is a 33.5 kDa serine peptidase of the alpha/beta-hydrolase family from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum. Subsequent to proteasomal protein degradation, tricorn generates small peptides, which are cleaved by F1 to yield single amino acids. We have solved the crystal structure of F1 with multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing at 1.8 A resolution. In addition to the conserved catalytic domain, the structure reveals a chiefly alpha-helical domain capping the catalytic triad. Thus, the active site is accessible only through a narrow opening from the protein surface. Two structures with molecules bound to the active serine, including the inhibitor phenylalanyl chloromethylketone, elucidate the N-terminal recognition of substrates and the catalytic activation switch mechanism of F1. The cap domain mainly confers the specificity for hydrophobic side chains by a novel cavity system, which, analogously to the tricorn protease, guides substrates to the buried active site and products away from it. Finally, the structure of F1 suggests a possible functional complex with tricorn that allows efficient processive degradation to free amino acids for cellular recycling.</p>

<p>In ClpXP and ClpAP complexes, ClpA and ClpX use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to unfold proteins and translocate them into the self-compartmentalized ClpP protease. ClpP requires the ATPases to degrade folded or unfolded substrates, but binding of acyldepsipeptide antibiotics (ADEPs) to ClpP bypasses this requirement with unfolded proteins. We present the crystal structure of Escherichia coli ClpP bound to ADEP1 and report the structural changes underlying ClpP activation. ADEP1 binds in the hydrophobic groove that serves as the primary docking site for ClpP ATPases. Binding of ADEP1 locks the N-terminal loops of ClpP in a β-hairpin conformation, generating a stable pore through which extended polypeptides can be threaded. This structure serves as a model for ClpP in the holoenzyme ClpAP and ClpXP complexes and provides critical information to further develop this class of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Water is ubiquitously present in any biological system and has therefore to be regarded as an additional binding partner in the protein-ligand binding process. Upon complex formation, a new solvent-exposed surface is generated and water molecules from the first solvation layer will arrange around this newly formed surface. So far, the influence of such water arrangements on the ligand binding properties is unknown. In this study, the binding modes of nine congeneric phosphonamidate-type inhibitors with systematically varied, size-increasing hydrophobic P2 ' substituents (from methyl to phenylethyl) addressing the hydrophobic, solvent-exposed S2 ' pocket of thermolysin were analyzed by high-resolution crystal structures and correlated with their thermodynamic binding profiles as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Overall, ΔΔG spreads over 7.0 kJ mol(-1) , ΔΔH varies by 15.8 kJ mol(-1) , and -TΔΔS by 12.1 kJ mol(-1) . Throughout the series, these changes correlate remarkably well with the geometric differences of water molecules arranged adjacent to the P2 ' substituents. Ligands with medium-sized P2 ' substituents exhibit highest affinities, presumably because of their optimal solvation patterns around these complexes. The addition, removal, or rearrangement of even a single methyl group can result in a strong modulation of the adjacent water network pattern shifting from enthalpy to entropy-driven binding. In conclusion, the quality of a water network assembled around a protein-ligand complex influences the enthalpy/entropy signature and can even modulate affinity to a surprising extent. </p>

<p>Predicting absolute protein-ligand binding affinities remains a frontier challenge in ligand discovery and design. This becomes more difficult when ionic interactions are involved because of the large opposing solvation and electrostatic attraction energies. In a blind test, we examined whether alchemical free-energy calculations could predict binding affinities of 14 charged and 5 neutral compounds previously untested as ligands for a cavity binding site in cytochrome c peroxidase. In this simplified site, polar and cationic ligands compete with solvent to interact with a buried aspartate. Predictions were tested by calorimetry, spectroscopy, and crystallography. Of the 15 compounds predicted to bind, 13 were experimentally confirmed, while 4 compounds were false negative predictions. Predictions had a root-mean-square error of 1.95 kcal/mol to the experimental affinities, and predicted poses had an average RMSD of 1.7Å to the crystallographic poses. This test serves as a benchmark for these thermodynamically rigorous calculations at predicting binding affinities for charged compounds and gives insights into the existing sources of error, which are primarily electrostatic interactions inside proteins. Our experiments also provide a useful set of ionic binding affinities in a simplified system for testing new affinity prediction methods.</p>

<p>Pteridine reductase (PTR1) is a target for drug development against Trypanosoma and Leishmania species, parasites that cause serious tropical diseases and for which therapies are inadequate. We adopted a structure-based approach to the design of novel PTR1 inhibitors based on three molecular scaffolds. A series of compounds, most newly synthesized, were identified as inhibitors with PTR1-species specific properties explained by structural differences between the T. brucei and L. major enzymes. The most potent inhibitors target T. brucei PTR1, and two compounds displayed antiparasite activity against the bloodstream form of the parasite. PTR1 contributes to antifolate drug resistance by providing a molecular bypass of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition. Therefore, combining PTR1 and DHFR inhibitors might improve therapeutic efficacy. We tested two new compounds with known DHFR inhibitors. A synergistic effect was observed for one particular combination highlighting the potential of such an approach for treatment of African sleeping sickness.</p>

<p>The design of efficient ligands remains a key challenge in drug discovery. In the quest for lead-like ligands for the FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), we designed two new classes of bicyclic sulfonamides to probe the contribution of conformational energy in these ligands. The [4.3.1] scaffold had consistently higher affinity compared to the [3.3.1] or monocyclic scaffolds, which could be attributed to better preorganization of two key recognition motifs. Surprisingly, the binding of the rigid [4.3.1] scaffold was enthalpy-driven and entropically disfavored compared to the flexible analogues. Cocrystal structures at atomic resolution revealed that the sulfonamide nitrogen in the bicyclic scaffolds can accept an unusual hydrogen bond from Tyr(113) that mimics the putative FKBP transition state. This resulted in the first lead-like, functionally active ligand for FKBP51. Our work exemplifies how atom-efficient ligands can be achieved by careful conformational control even in very open and thus difficult binding sites such as FKBP51.</p>

<p>Organophosphorus compound-based nerve agents inhibit the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) causing acute toxicity and death. Clinical treatment of nerve-agent poisoning is to use oxime-based antidotes to reactivate the inhibited AChE. However, the nerve agent tabun is resistant to oximes. To design improved oximes, crystal structures of a tabun-conjugated AChE in complex with different oximes are needed to guide the structural modifications of known antidotes. However, this type of structure is extremely challenging to obtain because both deamidation of the tabun conjugate and reactivation of AChE occur during crystallographic experiments. Here we report, for the first time, the crystal structures of Ortho-7 and HLö-7 in complex with AChE that is conjugated to an intact tabun. These structures were determined by our new strategy of combining crystallographic and mass spectrometric analyses of AChE crystals. The results explain the relative reactivation potencies of the two oximes and offer insights into improving known medical antidotes.</p>

<p>Dissemination of Acinetobacter baumannii strains harboring class D β-lactamases producing resistance to carbapenem antibiotics severely limits our ability to treat deadly Acinetobacter infections. Susceptibility determination in the A. baumannii background and kinetic studies with a homogeneous preparation of OXA-23 β-lactamase, the major carbapenemase present in A. baumannii, document the ability of this enzyme to manifest resistance to last-resort carbapenem antibiotics. We also report three X-ray structures of OXA-23: apo OXA-23 at two different pH values, and wild-type OXA-23 in complex with meropenem, a carbapenem substrate. The structures and dynamics simulations reveal an important role for Leu166, whose motion regulates the access of a hydrolytic water molecule to the acyl-enzyme species in imparting carbapenemase activity. </p>

<p>Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a target for hypoxic cancer therapies, and the discovery of CA IX selective ligands is imperative for the development of these agents. Primary sulfonamides are broad specificity inhibitors of CA enzymes, while secondary sulfonamides are generally poor CA inhibitors. However, saccharin, a cyclic secondary sulfonamide, has unusually good inhibition of CA IX (Ki = 103 nM). In this study, we demonstrate that the affinity and selectivity of saccharin for CA IX can be further modulated when linked to hydrophobic or hydrophilic substituents. The hydrophilic glycoconjugate derivative (12) showed improved inhibition of CA IX (Ki = 49.5 nM) and extremely poor inhibition of the predominant off-target CAs (Ki &gt; 50 000 nM) compared to saccharin. This &gt;1000-fold selectivity for CA IX over off-target CAs is unprecedented for classical primary sulfonamide CA inhibitors. Our study highlights the potential of cyclic secondary sulfonamides to be exploited for the discovery of potent, cancer-selective CA inhibitors. </p>

<p>Secretory low molecular weight phospholipase A(2)s (PLA(2)s) are believed to be involved in the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor for the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Therefore, the specific inhibitors of these enzymes may act as potent anti-inflammatory agents. Similarly, the compounds with known anti-inflammatory properties should act as specific inhibitors. Two plant compounds, (a) anisic acid (4-methoxy benzoic acid) and (b) atropine (8-methyl-8-azabicyclo oct-3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate), have been used in various inflammatory disorders. Both compounds (a) and (b) have been found to inhibit PLA(2) activity having binding constants of 4.5 x 10(-5) M and 2.1 x 10(-8) M, respectively. A group IIA PLA(2) was isolated and purified from the venom of Daboia russelli pulchella (DRP) and its complexes were made with anisic acid and atropine. The crystal structures of the two complexes (i) and (ii) of PLA(2) with compounds (a) and (b) have been determined at 1.3 and 1.2 A resolutions, respectively. The high-quality observed electron densities for the two compounds allowed the accurate determinations of their atomic positions. The structures revealed that these compounds bound to the enzyme at the substrate - binding cleft and their positions were stabilized by networks of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The most characteristic interactions involving Asp 49 and His 48 were clearly observed in both complexes, although the residues that formed hydrophobic interactions with these compounds were not identical because their positions did not exactly superimpose in the large substrate-binding hydrophobic channel. Owing to a relatively small size, the structure of anisic acid did not alter upon binding to PLA(2), while that of atropine changed significantly when compared with its native crystal structure. The conformation of the protein also did not show notable changes upon the bindings of these ligands. The mode of binding of anisic acid to the present group II PLA(2) is almost identical to its binding with bovine pancreatic PLA(2) of group I. On the other hand, the binding of atropine to PLA(2) is similar to that of another plant alkaloid aristolochic acid.</p>

<p>Many candidate unnatural DNA base pairs have been developed, but some of the best-replicated pairs adopt intercalated structures in free DNA that are difficult to reconcile with known mechanisms of polymerase recognition. Here we present crystal structures of KlenTaq DNA polymerase at different stages of replication for one such pair, dNaM-d5SICS, and show that efficient replication results from the polymerase itself, inducing the required natural-like structure.</p>

<p>The metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) adopt an alpha/beta protein fold first identified in rat liver arginase. Despite insignificant overall amino acid sequence identity, these enzymes share a strictly conserved metal binding site with divergent metal specificity and stoichiometry. HDAC8, originally thought to be a Zn(2+)-metallohydrolase, exhibits increased activity with Co(2+) and Fe(2+) cofactors based on k(cat)/K(M) (Gantt, S. L., Gattis, S. G., and Fierke, C. A. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 6170-6178). Here, we report the first X-ray crystal structures of metallo-substituted HDAC8, Co(2+)-HDAC8, D101L Co(2+)-HDAC8, D101L Mn(2+)-HDAC8, and D101L Fe(2+)-HDAC8, each complexed with the inhibitor M344. Metal content of protein samples in solution is confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. For the crystalline enzymes, peaks in Bijvoet difference Fourier maps calculated from X-ray diffraction data collected near the respective elemental absorption edges confirm metal substitution. Additional solution studies confirm incorporation of Cu(2+); Fe(3+) and Ni(2+) do not bind under conditions tested. The metal dependence of the substrate K(M) values and the K(i) values of hydroxamate inhibitors that chelate the active site metal are consistent with substrate-metal coordination in the precatalytic Michaelis complex that enhances catalysis. Additionally, although HDAC8 binds Zn(2+) nearly 10(6)-fold more tightly than Fe(2+), the affinities for both metal ions are comparable to the readily exchangeable metal concentrations estimated in living cells, suggesting that HDAC8 could bind either or both Fe(2+) or Zn(2+) in vivo.</p>

<p>Chemical reactions inside single crystals are quite rare because crystallinity is difficult to retain owing to atomic rearrangements. Protein crystals in general have a high solvent content. This allows for some molecular flexibility, which makes it possible to trap reaction intermediates of enzymatic reactions without disrupting the crystal lattice. A similar approach has not yet been fully implemented in the field of inorganic chemistry. Here, we have combined model chemistry and protein X-ray crystallography to study the intramolecular aromatic dihydroxylation by an arene-containing protein-bound iron complex. The bound complex was able to activate dioxygen in the presence of a reductant, leading to the formation of catechol as the sole product. The structure determination of four of the catalytic cycle intermediates and the end product showed that the hydroxylation reaction implicates an iron peroxo, generated by reductive O(2) activation, an intermediate already observed in iron monooxygenases. This strategy also provided unexpected mechanistic details such as the rearrangement of the iron coordination sphere on metal reduction.</p>

<p>Water is ubiquitously present in any biological system and has therefore to be regarded as an additional binding partner in the protein-ligand binding process. Upon complex formation, a new solvent-exposed surface is generated and water molecules from the first solvation layer will arrange around this newly formed surface. So far, the influence of such water arrangements on the ligand binding properties is unknown. In this study, the binding modes of nine congeneric phosphonamidate-type inhibitors with systematically varied, size-increasing hydrophobic P2 ' substituents (from methyl to phenylethyl) addressing the hydrophobic, solvent-exposed S2 ' pocket of thermolysin were analyzed by high-resolution crystal structures and correlated with their thermodynamic binding profiles as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Overall, ΔΔG spreads over 7.0 kJ mol(-1) , ΔΔH varies by 15.8 kJ mol(-1) , and -TΔΔS by 12.1 kJ mol(-1) . Throughout the series, these changes correlate remarkably well with the geometric differences of water molecules arranged adjacent to the P2 ' substituents. Ligands with medium-sized P2 ' substituents exhibit highest affinities, presumably because of their optimal solvation patterns around these complexes. The addition, removal, or rearrangement of even a single methyl group can result in a strong modulation of the adjacent water network pattern shifting from enthalpy to entropy-driven binding. In conclusion, the quality of a water network assembled around a protein-ligand complex influences the enthalpy/entropy signature and can even modulate affinity to a surprising extent. </p>

<p>MbtI is the salicylate synthase that catalyzes the first committed step in the synthesis of the iron chelating compound mycobactin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We previously developed a series of aromatic inhibitors against MbtI based on the reaction intermediate for this enzyme, isochorismate. The most potent of these inhibitors had hydrophobic substituents, ranging in size from a methyl to a phenyl group, appended to the terminal alkene of the enolpyruvyl group. These compounds exhibited low micromolar inhibition constants against MbtI and were at least an order of magnitude more potent than the parental compound for the series, which carries a native enolpyruvyl group. In this study, we sought to understand how the substituted enolpyruvyl group confers greater potency, by determining cocrystal structures of MbtI with six inhibitors from the series. A switch in binding mode at the MbtI active site is observed for inhibitors carrying a substituted enolpyruvyl group, relative to the parental compound. Computational studies suggest that the change in binding mode, and higher potency, is due to the effect of the substituents on the conformational landscape of the core inhibitor structure. The crystal structures and fluorescence-based thermal shift assays indicate that substituents larger than a methyl group are accommodated in the MbtI active site through significant but localized flexibility in the peptide backbone. These findings have implications for the design of improved inhibitors of MbtI, as well as other chorismate-utilizing enzymes from this family.</p>

<p>Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine with tetrahydrofolate serving as the one-carbon carrier. SHMT also catalyzes the folate-independent retroaldol cleavage of allothreonine and 3-phenylserine and the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate to 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Studies of wild-type and site mutants of SHMT have failed to clearly establish the mechanism of this enzyme. The cleavage of 3-hydroxy amino acids to glycine and an aldehyde occurs by a retroaldol mechanism. However, the folate-dependent cleavage of serine can be described by either the same retroaldol mechanism with formaldehyde as an enzyme-bound intermediate or by a nucleophilic displacement mechanism in which N5 of tetrahydrofolate displaces the C3 hydroxyl of serine, forming a covalent intermediate. Glu75 of SHMT is clearly involved in the reaction mechanism; it is within hydrogen bonding distance of the hydroxyl group of serine and the formyl group of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in complexes of these species with SHMT. This residue was changed to Leu and Gln, and the structures, kinetics, and spectral properties of the site mutants were determined. Neither mutation significantly changed the structure of SHMT, the spectral properties of its complexes, or the kinetics of the retroaldol cleavage of allothreonine and 3-phenylserine. However, both mutations blocked the folate-dependent serine-to-glycine reaction and the conversion of methenyltetrahydrofolate to 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. These results clearly indicate that interaction of Glu75 with folate is required for folate-dependent reactions catalyzed by SHMT. Moreover, we can now propose a promising modification to the retroaldol mechanism for serine cleavage. As the first step, N5 of tetrahydrofolate makes a nucleophilic attack on C3 of serine, breaking the C2-C3 bond to form N5-hydroxymethylenetetrahydrofolate and an enzyme-bound glycine anion. The transient formation of formaldehyde as an intermediate is possible, but not required. This mechanism explains the greatly enhanced rate of serine cleavage in the presence of folate, and avoids some serious difficulties presented by the nucleophilic displacement mechanism involving breakage of the C3-OH bond.</p>

<p>Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) is a nonheme iron(II)-dependent oxidase that catalyses the central step in penicillin biosynthesis, conversion of the tripeptide delta-L-alpha-aminoadipoyl-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) to isopenicillin N (IPN). This report describes mechanistic studies using the analogue delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipoyl)-(3S-methyl)-L-cysteine D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleryl ester (A(S)mCOV), designed to intercept the catalytic cycle at an early stage. A(S)mCOV incorporates two modifications from the natural substrate: the second and third residues are joined by an ester, so this analogue lacks the key amide of ACV and cannot form a beta-lactam; and the cysteinyl residue is substituted at its beta-carbon, bearing a (3S)-methyl group. It was anticipated that this methyl group will impinge directly on the site in which the co-substrate dioxygen binds. The novel depsipeptide A(S)mCOV was prepared in 13 steps and crystallised with IPNS anaerobically. The 1.65 A structure of the IPNS-Fe(II)-A(S)mCOV complex reveals that the additional beta-methyl group is not oriented directly into the oxygen binding site, but does increase steric demand in the active site and increases disorder in the position of the isovaleryl side chain. Crystals of IPNS-Fe(II)-A(S)mCOV were incubated with high-pressure oxygen gas, driving substrate turnover to a single product, an ene-thiol/C-hydroxylated depsipeptide. A mechanism is proposed for the reaction of A(S)mCOV with IPNS, linking this result to previous crystallographic studies with related depsipeptides and solution-phase experiments with cysteine-methylated tripeptides. This result demonstrates that a (3S)-methyl group at the substrate cysteinyl beta-carbon is not in itself a block to IPNS activity as previously proposed, and sheds further light on the steric complexities of IPNS catalysis.</p>

<p>Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, an important anaplerotic reaction in mammalian tissues. To effect catalysis, the tethered biotin of PC must gain access to active sites in both the biotin carboxylase domain and the carboxyl transferase domain. Previous studies have demonstrated that a mutation of threonine 882 to alanine in PC from Rhizobium etli renders the carboxyl transferase domain inactive and favors the positioning of biotin in the biotin carboxylase domain. We report the 2.4 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of the Rhizobium etli PC T882A mutant which reveals the first high-resolution description of the domain interaction between the biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain and the biotin carboxylase domain. The overall quaternary arrangement of Rhizobium etli PC remains highly asymmetrical and is independent of the presence of allosteric activator. While biotin is observed in the biotin carboxylase domain, its access to the active site is precluded by the interaction between Arg353 and Glu248, revealing a mechanism for regulating carboxybiotin access to the BC domain active site. The binding location for the biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain demonstrates that tethered biotin cannot bind in the biotin carboxylase domain active site in the same orientation as free biotin, helping to explain the difference in catalysis observed between tethered biotin and free biotin substrates in biotin carboxylase enzymes. Electron density located in the biotin carboxylase domain active site is assigned to phosphonoacetate, offering a probable location for the putative carboxyphosphate intermediate formed during biotin carboxylation. The insights gained from the T882A Rhizobium etli PC crystal structure provide a new series of catalytic snapshots in PC and offer a revised perspective on catalysis in the biotin-dependent enzyme family.</p>

<p>Malarial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is the target of antifolate antimalarial drugs such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, the clinical efficacy of which have been compromised by resistance arising through mutations at various sites on the enzyme. Here, we describe the use of cocrystal structures with inhibitors and substrates, along with efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiling for the design, characterization, and preclinical development of a selective, highly efficacious, and orally available antimalarial drug candidate that potently inhibits both wild-type and clinically relevant mutated forms of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) DHFR. Important structural characteristics of P218 include pyrimidine side-chain flexibility and a carboxylate group that makes charge-mediated hydrogen bonds with conserved Arg122 (PfDHFR-TS amino acid numbering). An analogous interaction of P218 with human DHFR is disfavored because of three species-dependent amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the conserved Arg. Thus, P218 binds to the active site of PfDHFR in a substantially different fashion from the human enzyme, which is the basis for its high selectivity. Unlike pyrimethamine, P218 binds both wild-type and mutant PfDHFR in a slow-on/slow-off tight-binding mode, which prolongs the target residence time. P218, when bound to PfDHFR-TS, resides almost entirely within the envelope mapped out by the dihydrofolate substrate, which may make it less susceptible to resistance mutations. The high in vivo efficacy in a SCID mouse model of P. falciparum malaria, good oral bioavailability, favorable enzyme selectivity, and good safety characteristics of P218 make it a potential candidate for further development.</p>

<p>Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) catalyzes the final step of the mevalonate pathway, the Mg(2+)-ATP dependent decarboxylation of mevalonate 5-diphosphate (MVAPP), producing isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Synthesis of IPP, an isoprenoid precursor molecule that is a critical intermediate in peptidoglycan and polyisoprenoid biosynthesis, is essential in Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus spp.), and thus the enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are ideal antimicrobial targets. MDD belongs to the GHMP superfamily of metabolite kinases that have been extensively studied for the past 50 years, yet the crystallization of GHMP kinase ternary complexes has proven to be difficult. To further our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of GHMP kinases with the purpose of developing broad spectrum antimicrobial agents that target the substrate and nucleotide binding sites, we report the crystal structures of wild-type and mutant (S192A and D283A) ternary complexes of Staphylococcus epidermidis MDD. Comparison of apo, MVAPP-bound, and ternary complex wild-type MDD provides structural information about the mode of substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. Structural characterization of ternary complexes of catalytically deficient MDD S192A and D283A (k(cat) decreased 10(3)- and 10(5)-fold, respectively) provides insight into MDD function. The carboxylate side chain of invariant Asp(283) functions as a catalytic base and is essential for the proper orientation of the MVAPP C3-hydroxyl group within the active site funnel. Several MDD amino acids within the conserved phosphate binding loop ("P-loop") provide key interactions, stabilizing the nucleotide triphosphoryl moiety.

<p>Lecithin:retinol acyltransferase-like proteins, also referred to as HRAS-like tumor suppressors, comprise a vertebrate subfamily of papain-like or NlpC/P60 thiol proteases that function as phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes. HRAS-like tumor suppressor 3, a representative member of this group, plays a key role in regulating triglyceride accumulation and energy expenditure in adipocytes and therefore constitutes a novel pharmacological target for treatment of metabolic disorders causing obesity. Here, we delineate a catalytic mechanism common to lecithin:retinol acyltransferase-like proteins and provide evidence for their alternative robust lipid-dependent acyltransferase enzymatic activity. We also determined high resolution crystal structures of HRAS-like tumor suppressor 2 and 3 to gain insight into their active site architecture. Based on this structural analysis, two conformational states of the catalytic Cys-113 were identified that differ in reactivity and thus could define the catalytic properties of these two proteins. Finally, these structures provide a model for the topology of these enzymes and allow identification of the protein-lipid bilayer interface. This study contributes to the enzymatic and structural understanding of HRAS-like tumor suppressor enzymes.</p>

<p>Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is a rate-limiting enzyme in nucleotide biosynthesis studied as an important therapeutic target and its complex functioning in vivo is still puzzling and debated. Here, we highlight the structural basis for the regulation of IMPDHs by MgATP. Our results demonstrate the essential role of the CBS tandem, conserved among almost all IMPDHs. We found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa IMPDH is an octameric enzyme allosterically regulated by MgATP and showed that this octameric organization is widely conserved in the crystal structures of other IMPDHs. We also demonstrated that human IMPDH1 adopts two types of complementary octamers that can pile up into isolated fibers in the presence of MgATP. The aggregation of such fibers in the autosomal dominant mutant, D226N, could explain the onset of the retinopathy adRP10. Thus, the regulatory CBS modules in IMPDHs are functional and they can either modulate catalysis or macromolecular assembly.</p>

<p>Human carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1) is a drug and endobiotic-processing serine hydrolase that exhibits relatively broad substrate specificity. It has been implicated in a variety of endogenous cholesterol metabolism pathways including the following apparently disparate reactions: cholesterol ester hydrolysis (CEH), fatty acyl Coenzyme A hydrolysis (FACoAH), acyl-Coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransfer (ACAT), and fatty acyl ethyl ester synthesis (FAEES). The structural basis for the ability of hCE1 to perform these catalytic actions involving large substrates and products has remained unclear. Here we present four crystal structures of the hCE1 glycoprotein in complexes with the following endogenous substrates or substrate analogues: Coenzyme A, the fatty acid palmitate, and the bile acids cholate and taurocholate. While the active site of hCE1 was known to be promiscuous and capable of interacting with a variety of chemically distinct ligands, these structures reveal that the enzyme contains two additional ligand-binding sites and that each site also exhibits relatively non-specific ligand-binding properties. Using this multisite promiscuity, hCE1 appears structurally capable of assembling several catalytic events depending, apparently, on the physiological state of the cellular environment. These results expand our understanding of enzyme promiscuity and indicate that, in the case of hCE1, multiple non-specific sites are employed to perform distinct catalytic actions.</p>

<p>Tapes japonica lysozyme (TJL) is classified as a member of the recently established i-type lysozyme family. In this study, we solved the crystal structure of TJL complexed with a trimer of N-acetylglucosamine to 1.6A resolution. Based on structure and mutation analyses, we demonstrated that Glu-18 and Asp-30 are the catalytic residues of TJL. Furthermore, the present findings suggest that the catalytic mechanism of TJL is a retaining mechanism that proceeds through a covalent sugar-enzyme intermediate. On the other hand, the quaternary structure in the crystal revealed a dimer formed by the electrostatic interactions of catalytic residues (Glu-18 and Asp-30) in one molecule with the positive residues at the C terminus in helix 6 of the other molecule. Gel chromatography analysis revealed that the TJL dimer remained intact under low salt conditions but that it dissociated to TJL monomers under high salt conditions. With increasing salt concentrations, the chitinase activity of TJL dramatically increased. Therefore, this study provides novel evidence that the lysozyme activity of TJL is modulated by its quaternary structure.</p>

Solution-phase incubation experiments have shown that IPNS turns over analogues with a diverse range of side chains in the third (valinyl) position of the substrate, but copes less well with changes in the second (cysteinyl) residue. IPNS thus converts the homologated tripeptides δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-valine (AhCV) and δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-allylglycine (AhCaG) into monocyclic hydroxy-lactam products; this suggests that the additional methylene unit in these substrates induces conformational changes that preclude second ring closure after initial lactam formation. To investigate this and solution-phase results with other tripeptides δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-Xaa, we have crystallised AhCV and δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-S-methylcysteine (AhCmC) with IPNS and solved crystal structures for the resulting complexes. The IPNS:Fe(II):AhCV complex shows diffuse electron density for several regions of the substrate, revealing considerable conformational freedom within the active site. The substrate is more clearly resolved in the IPNS:Fe(II):AhCmC complex, by virtue of thioether coordination to iron. AhCmC occupies two distinct conformations, both distorted relative to the natural substrate ACV, in order to accommodate the extra methylene group in the second residue. Attempts to turn these substrates over within crystalline IPNS using hyperbaric oxygenation give rise to product mixtures.</p>

<p>Aerotoxic syndrome is assumed to be caused by exposure to tricresyl phosphate (TCP), an antiwear additive in jet engine lubricants and hydraulic fluid. CBDP (2-(ortho-cresyl)-4H-1,2,3-benzodioxaphosphoran-2-one) is the toxic metabolite of triortho-cresylphosphate, a component of TCP. Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; EC 3.1.1.8) and human acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) are irreversibly inhibited by CBDP. The bimolecular rate constants of inhibition (k(i)), determined under pseudo-first-order conditions, displayed a biphasic time course of inhibition with k(i) of 1.6 × 10(8) M(-1) min(-1) and 2.7 × 10(7) M(-1) min(-1) for E and E' forms of BChE. The inhibition constants for AChE were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude slower than those for BChE. CBDP-phosphorylated cholinesterases are nonreactivatable due to ultra fast aging. Mass spectrometry analysis showed an initial BChE adduct with an added mass of 170 Da from cresylphosphate, followed by dealkylation to a structure with an added mass of 80 Da. Mass spectrometry in (18)O-water showed that (18)O was incorporated only during the final aging step to form phospho-serine as the final aged BChE adduct. The crystal structure of CBDP-inhibited BChE confirmed that the phosphate adduct is the ultimate aging product. CBDP is the first organophosphorus agent that leads to a fully dealkylated phospho-serine BChE adduct.</p>

<p>The final step of the methylerythritol phosphate isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway is catalysed by the iron-sulphur enzyme IspH, producing the universal precursors of terpenes: isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate. Here we report an unforeseen reaction discovered during the investigation of the interaction of IspH with acetylene inhibitors by X-ray crystallography, Mößbauer, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition to its role as a 2H(+)/2e(-) reductase, IspH can hydrate acetylenes to aldehydes and ketones via anti-Markovnikov/Markovnikov addition. The reactions only occur with the oxidised protein and proceed via η(1)-O-enolate intermediates. One of these is characterized crystallographically and contains a C4 ligand oxygen bound to the unique, fourth iron in the 4Fe-4S cluster: this intermediate subsequently hydrolyzes to produce an aldehyde product. This unexpected side to IspH reactivity is of interest in the context of the mechanism of action of other acetylene hydratases, as well as in the design of antiinfectives targeting IspH.</p>

<p>The crystallographic structure of feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus niger has been determined to a resolution of 1.5 A by molecular replacement. The protein has an alpha/beta-hydrolase structure with a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad; the overall fold of the protein is very similar to that of the fungal lipases. The structure of the enzyme-product complex was determined to a resolution of 1.08 A and reveals dual conformations for the serine and histidine residues at the active site.</p>

<p>Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is indispensable during glycolysis for anaerobic glucose degradation and energy generation. Here we present comprehensive structure analysis of two putative PGKs from Bacillus anthracis str. Sterne and Campylobacter jejuni in the context of their structural homologs. They are the first PGKs from pathogenic bacteria reported in the Protein Data Bank. The crystal structure of PGK from Bacillus anthracis str. Sterne (BaPGK) has been determined at 1.68 Å while the structure of PGK from Campylobacter jejuni (CjPGK) has been determined at 2.14 Å resolution. The proteins' monomers are composed of two domains, each containing a Rossmann fold, hinged together by a helix which can be used to adjust the relative position between two domains. It is also shown that apo-forms of both BaPGK and CjPGK adopt open conformations as compared to the substrate and ATP bound forms of PGK from other species.</p>

<p>Natural cellulose exists as a composite of different forms, which have historically been broadly characterized as "crystalline" or "amorphous". The recognition of both of these forms of cellulose by the carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) of microbial glycoside hydrolases is central to natural and efficient biotechnological conversion of plant cell wall biomass. There is increasing evidence that, at least some, individual binding modules target distinct and different regions of non-crystalline "amorphous" cellulose. Competition experiments show that CBM28 modules do not compete with CBM17 modules when binding to non-crystalline cellulose. The structure of the BspCBM28 (http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/) module from the Bacillus sp. 1139 family GH5 endoglucanase, comprising a 191 amino acid protein, has therefore been determined at 1.4A resolution using single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering methods. The structure reveals a "beta-jelly roll" topology, with high degree of similarity to the structure of CBM17 domains. Sequence and structural conservation strongly suggests that these two families of domains have evolved through gene duplication and subsequent divergence. The ligand-binding site "topographies" of CBMs from families 28, 17 and 4 begins to shed light on the differential recognition of non-crystalline cellulose by multi-modular plant cell wall-degrading enzymes.</p>

<p>Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most dreaded pathogens worldwide and emergence of notorious antibiotic resistant strains have further exacerbated the present scenario. The glycolytic enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is one of the cell envelope proteins of the coccus and is involved in biofilm formation. It also plays an instrumental role in adherence and invasion of the bacteria into the host cell. To structurally characterize this important enzyme and analyze it's interaction with different inhibitors, substrate and transition state analogues, the present article describes several crystal structures of SaTIM alone and in complex with different ligands: glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), glycerol-2-phosphate (G2P), 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PG) and 2-phosphoglyceric acid (2PG). Unique conformations of the catalytic loop 6 (L6) has been observed in the different complexes. It is found to be in "almost closed" conformation in both subunits of the structure complexed to G3P. However L6 adopts the open conformation in presence of G2P and 2PG. The preference of the conformation of the catalytic loop can be correlated with the position of the phosphate group in the ligand. Novel modes of binding have been observed for G2P and 3PG for the very first time. The triose moiety is oriented away from the catalytic residues and occupies an entirely different position in some subunits. A completely new binding site for phosphate has also been identified in the complex with 2PG which differs substantially from the conventional phosphate binding site of the ligand in the crystal structures of TIM determined so far.</p>

<p>Tremendous gains and novel methods are often developed when people are challenged to do something new or difficult.

<p>Ferritins are a family of proteins distributed widely in nature. In bacterial, plant, and animal cells, ferritin appears to serve as a soluble, bioavailable, and non-toxic form of iron provider. Ferritins from animal sources are heteropolymers composed of two types of subunit, H and L, which differ mainly by the presence (H) or absence (L) of active ferroxidase centres. We report the crystallographic structures of four human H apoferritin variants at a resolution of up to 1.5 Angstrom. Crystal derivatives using Zn(II) as redox-stable alternative for Fe(II), allows us to characterize the different metal-binding sites. The ferroxidase centre, which is composed of sites A and B, binds metal with a preference for the A site. In addition, distinct Zn(II)-binding sites were found in the 3-fold axes, 4-fold axes and on the cavity surface near the ferroxidase centre. To study the importance of the distance of the two metal atoms in the ferroxidase centre, single and double replacement of glutamate 27 (site A) and glutamate 107 (site B), the two axial ligands, by aspartate residues have been carried out. The consequences for metal binding and the correlation with Fe(II) oxidation rates are discussed.</p>

<p>Serine hydroxymethyltransferase is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of serine and glycine using tetrahydropteroylglutamate as the one-carbon carrier. In all pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, amino acid substrates are bound and released through a transaldimination process, in which an internal aldimine and an external aldimine are interconverted via gem-diamine intermediates. Bioinformatic analyses of serine hydroxymethyltransferase sequences and structures showed the presence of two highly conserved residues, a tyrosine and an arginine, engaged in a cation-pi interaction. In Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltranferase, the hydroxyl group of this conserved tyrosine (Tyr55) is located in a position compatible with a role as hydrogen exchanger in the transaldimination reaction. Because of the location of Tyr55 at the active site, the enhancement of its acidic properties caused by the cation-pi interaction with Arg235, and the hydrogen bonds established by its hydroxyl group, a role of this residue as acid-base catalyst in the transaldimination process was envisaged. The role played by this cation-pi interaction in the E. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase was investigated by crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis using Y55F and three R235 mutant forms. The crystal structure of the Y55F mutant suggests that the presence of Tyr55 is indispensable for a correct positioning of the cofactor and for the maintenance of the structure of several loops involved in substrate and cofactor binding. The kinetic properties of all mutant enzymes are profoundly altered. Substrate binding and rapid kinetic experiments showed that both Y55 and R235 are required for a correct progress of the transaldimination reaction.</p>

<p>The RsmG methyltransferase is responsible for N(7) methylation of G527 of 16S rRNA in bacteria. Here, we report the identification of the Thermus thermophilus rsmG gene, the isolation of rsmG mutants, and the solution of RsmG X-ray crystal structures at up to 1.5 A resolution. Like their counterparts in other species, T. thermophilus rsmG mutants are weakly resistant to the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin. Growth competition experiments indicate a physiological cost to loss of RsmG activity, consistent with the conservation of the modification site in the decoding region of the ribosome. In contrast to Escherichia coli RsmG, which has been reported to recognize only intact 30S subunits, T. thermophilus RsmG shows no in vitro methylation activity against native 30S subunits, only low activity with 30S subunits at low magnesium concentration, and maximum activity with deproteinized 16S rRNA. Cofactor-bound crystal structures of RsmG reveal a positively charged surface area remote from the active site that binds an adenosine monophosphate molecule. We conclude that an early assembly intermediate is the most likely candidate for the biological substrate of RsmG.</p>

<p>alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase (alpha3GalT, EC 2.4.1.151) is a Golgi-resident, type II transmembrane protein that transfers galactose from UDP-alpha-galactose to the terminal N:-acetyllactosamine unit of glycoconjugate glycans, producing the Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc oligosaccharide structure present in most mammalian glycoproteins. Unlike most other mammals, humans and Old World primates do not possess alpha3GalT activity, which is relevant for the hyperacute rejection observed in pig-to-human xenotransplantation. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of substrate-free bovine alpha3GalT, solved and refined to 2.3 A resolution, has a globular shape with an alpha/beta fold containing a narrow cleft on one face, and shares a UDP-binding domain (UBD) with the recently solved inverting glycosyltransferases. The substrate-bound complex, solved and refined to 2.5 A, allows the description of residues interacting directly with UDP-galactose. These structural data suggest that the strictly conserved residue E317 is likely to be the catalytic nucleophile involved in galactose transfer with retention of anomeric configuration as accomplished by this enzyme. Moreover, the alpha3GalT structure helps to identify amino acid residues that determine the specificities of the highly homologous ABO histo-blood group and glycosphingolipid glycosyltransferases.</p>

<p>The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) have been linked to an extraordinarily diversified group of cellular functions making these enzymes compelling targets for the treatment of disease. A large body of evidence has linked PI3Kγ to the modulation of autoimmune and inflammatory processes making it an intriguing target for drug discovery. Our high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign revealed two hits that were nominated for further optimization studies. The in vitro activity of the first HTS hit, designated as the sulfonylpiperazine scaffold, was optimized utilizing structure-based design. However, nonoptimal pharmacokinetic properties precluded this series from further studies. An overlay of the X-ray structures of the sulfonylpiperazine scaffold and the second HTS hit within their complexes with PI3Kγ revealed a high degree of overlap. This feature was utilized to design a series of hybrid analogues including advanced leads such as 31 with desirable potency, selectivity, and oral bioavailability.</p>

<p>Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a vital metabolic enzyme and thus a clinically prominent target in the design of antimetabolites. In this work, we identify 1,4-bis-{[N-(1-imino-1-guanidino-methyl)]sulfanylmethyl}-3,6-dimethyl-benzene (compound 1) as the correct structure of the previously reported DHFR inhibitor 1,4-bis-{(iminothioureidomethyl)aminomethyl}-3,6-dimethyl-benzene (compound 2). The fact that compound 1 has an uncharacteristic structure for DHFR inhibitors, and an affinity (KI of 11.5 nM) comparable to potent inhibitors such as methotrexate and trimethoprim, made this inhibitor of interest for further analysis. We have conducted a characterization of the primary interactions of compound 1 and DHFR using a combination of X-ray structure and SAR analysis. The crystal structure of E. coli DHFR in complex with compound 1 and NADPH reveals that one portion of this inhibitor exploits a unique binding surface, the M20 loop. The importance of this interface was further confirmed by SAR analysis and additional structural characterization.</p>

<p>CDK2 inhibitors containing the related bicyclic heterocycles pyrazolopyrimidines and imidazopyrazines were discovered through high-throughput screening. Crystal structures of inhibitors with these bicyclic cores and two more related ones show that all but one have a common binding mode featuring two hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) to the backbone of the kinase hinge region. Even though ab initio computations indicated that the imidazopyrazine core would bind more tightly to the hinge, pyrazolopyrimidines gain an advantage in potency through participation of N4 in an H-bond network involving two catalytic residues and bridging water molecules. Further insight into inhibitor/CDK2 interactions was gained from analysis of additional crystal structures. Significant gains in potency were obtained by optimizing the fit of hydrophobic substituents to the gatekeeper region of the ATP binding site. The most potent inhibitors have good selectivity.</p>

<p>Hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase (1,2-HQD) catalyzes the ring cleavage of hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene), a central intermediate in the degradation of aromatic compounds including a variety of particularly recalcitrant polychloro- and nitroaromatic pollutants. We report here the primary sequence determination and the analysis of the crystal structure of the 1,2-HQD from Nocardioides simplex 3E solved at 1.75 A resolution using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion of the two catalytic irons (1 Fe/293 amino acids). The catalytic Fe(III) coordination polyhedron composed by the side chains of Tyr164, Tyr197, His221, and His223 resembles that of the other known intradiol-cleaving dioxygenases, but several of the tertiary structure features are notably different. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the present structure is the extensive openings and consequent exposure to solvent of the upper part of the catalytic cavity arranged to favor the binding of hydroxyquinols but not catechols. A co-crystallized benzoate-like molecule is also found bound to the metal center forming a distinctive hydrogen bond network as observed previously also in 4-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Rhodococcus opacus 1CP. This is the first structure of an intradiol dioxygenase specialized in hydroxyquinol ring cleavage to be investigated in detail.</p>

<p>Structures of human cytochrome P450 2B6 and rabbit cytochrome P450 2B4 in complex with two molecules of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The presence of two drug molecules suggests clear substrate access channels in each P450. According to a previously established nomenclature, amlodipine molecules were trapped in access pathway 2f in P450 2B6 and in pathway 2a or 2f in P450 2B4. These pathways overlap for part of the length and then diverge as they extend toward the protein surface. A previously described solvent channel was also found in each enzyme. The results indicate that key residues located on the surface and at the entrance of the substrate access channels in each of these P450s may play a crucial role in guiding substrate entry. In addition, the region of P450 2B6 and 2B4 involving helices B', F, F', and G' and part of helix G is substantially more open in the amlodipine complexes than in the corresponding 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole complexes. The increased active site volume observed results from the major retraction of helices F, F', and B' and the β4 sheet region located close to the binding cavity to accommodate amlodipine. These structures demonstrate novel insight into distinct conformational states not observed with previous P450 2B structures and provide clear evidence of the substrate access channels in two drug-metabolizing P450s. In addition, the structures exhibit the versatility that can be exploited via in silico studies with other P450 2B6 ligands as large as raloxifene and itraconazole.</p>

<p>Chitin is an essential structural component of the fungal cell wall. Chitinases are thought to be important for fungal cell wall remodelling, and inhibition of these enzymes has been proposed as a potential strategy for development of novel anti-fungals. The fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus possesses two distinct multi-gene chitinase families. Here we explore acetazolamide as a chemical scaffold for the inhibition of an A. fumigatus 'plant-type' chitinase. A co-crystal structure of AfChiA1 with acetazolamide was used to guide synthesis and screening of acetazolamide analogues that yielded SAR in agreement with these structural data. Although acetazolamide and its analogues are weak inhibitors of the enzyme, they have a high ligand efficiency and as such are interesting leads for future inhibitor development.</p>

<p>Cytosolic 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN) and mitochondrial 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase (mdN) catalyze the dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates and regulate dTTP formation in cytosol and mitochondria, protecting DNA replication from imbalanced precursor pools. They can also interfere with the phosphorylation-dependent activation of nucleoside analogues used in anticancer and antiviral treatment. To understand the relatively narrow substrate specificity of these two enzymes and their ability to use nucleotide analogues as substrates, we determined the crystal structures of human cdN in complex with deoxyuridine, murine cdN in complex with dUMP and dGMP, and human mdN in complex with the nucleotide analogues AZTMP and BVdUMP. Our results show that the active site residues Leu45 and Tyr65 in cdN form a more favorable binding surface for purine nucleotides than the corresponding Trp75 and Trp76 in mdN, explaining why cdN has higher activity for purine nucleotides than does mdN. The molecular interactions of mdN with AZTMP and BVdUMP indicate why these nucleotide analogues are poorer substrates as compared with the physiological substrate, and they provide a structural rationale for the design of drugs that are less prone to inactivation by the deoxyribonucleotidases. We suggest that introduction of substituents in the 3'-position may result in nucleoside analogues with increased resistance to dephosphorylation.</p>

<p>Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA) are endogenously produced amino acids that inhibit all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). ADMA accumulates in various disease states, including renal failure, diabetes and pulmonary hypertension, and its concentration in plasma is strongly predictive of premature cardiovascular disease and death. Both L-NMMA and ADMA are eliminated largely through active metabolism by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) and thus DDAH dysfunction may be a crucial unifying feature of increased cardiovascular risk. However, despite considerable interest in this pathway and in the role of ADMA as a cardiovascular risk factor, there is little evidence to support a causal role of ADMA in pathophysiology. Here we reveal the structure of human DDAH-1 and probe the function of DDAH-1 both by deleting the DDAH1 gene in mice and by using DDAH-specific inhibitors which, as we demonstrate by crystallography, bind to the active site of human DDAH-1. We show that loss of DDAH-1 activity leads to accumulation of ADMA and reduction in NO signaling. This in turn causes vascular pathophysiology, including endothelial dysfunction, increased systemic vascular resistance and elevated systemic and pulmonary blood pressure. Our results also suggest that DDAH inhibition could be harnessed therapeutically to reduce the vascular collapse associated with sepsis.</p>

<p>A number of human cancers harbor somatic point mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2). These mutations alter residues in the enzyme active sites and confer a gain-of-function in cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation and secretion of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). We developed a small molecule, AGI-6780, that potently and selectively inhibits the tumor-associated mutant IDH2/R140Q. A crystal structure of AGI-6780 complexed with IDH2/R140Q revealed that the inhibitor binds in an allosteric manner at the dimer interface. The results of steady-state enzymology analysis were consistent with allostery and slow-tight binding by AGI-6780. Treatment with AGI-6780 induced differentiation of TF-1 erythroleukemia and primary human acute myelogenous leukemia cells in vitro. These data provide proof-of-concept that inhibitors targeting mutant IDH2/R140Q could have potential applications as a differentiation therapy for cancer.</p>

<p>Thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) is a key flavoenzyme expressed by schistosomes that bridges two detoxification pathways crucial for the parasite survival in the host's organism. In this article we report the crystal structure (at 2.2 A resolution) of TGR from Schistosoma mansoni (SmTGR), deleted in the last two residues. The structure reveals the peculiar architecture of this chimeric enzyme: the small Glutaredoxin (Grx) domain at the N-terminus is joined to the large thioredoxin reductase (TR) one via an extended complementary surface, involving residues not conserved in the Grx superfamily; the TR domain interacts with an identical partner via its C-terminal domain, forming a dimer with a twisted "W" shape. Although lacking the penultimate Selenocysteine residue (Sec), the enzyme is still able to reduce oxidized glutathione. These data update the interpretation of the interdomain communication in TGR enzymes. The possible function of this enzyme in pathogenic parasites is discussed.</p>

<p>The main proteinase (M(pro)) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is a principal target for the design of anticoronaviral compounds. Benzotriazole esters have been reported as potent nonpeptidic inhibitors of the enzyme, but their exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV M(pro), the active-site cysteine of which has been acylated by benzotriazole esters that act as suicide inhibitors. In one of the structures, the thioester product has been hydrolyzed and benzoic acid is observed to bind to the hydrophobic S2 pocket. This structure also features the enzyme with a shortened N-terminal segment ("amputated N finger"). The results further the understanding of the important role of the N finger for catalysis as well as the design of benzotriazole inhibitors with improved specificity.</p>

<p>Seasonal and pandemic flaviviruses continue to be leading global health concerns. With the view to help drug discovery against Dengue virus (DENV), a fragment-based experimental approach was applied to identify small molecule ligands targeting two main components of the flavivirus replication complex: the NS3 helicase (Hel) and the NS5 mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) domains. A library of 500 drug-like fragments was first screened by thermal-shift assay (TSA) leading to the identification of 36 and 32 fragment hits binding Hel and MTase from DENV, respectively. In a second stage, we set up a fragment-based X-ray crystallographic screening (FBS-X) in order to provide both validated fragment hits and structural binding information. No fragment hit was confirmed for DENV Hel. In contrast, a total of seven fragments were identified as DENV MTase binders and structures of MTase-fragment hit complexes were solved at resolution at least 2.0Å or better. All fragment hits identified contain either a five- or six-membered aromatic ring or both, and three novel binding sites were located on the MTase. To further characterize the fragment hits identified by TSA and FBS-X, we performed enzymatic assays to assess their inhibition effect on the N7- and 2'-O-MTase enzymatic activities: five of these fragment hits inhibit at least one of the two activities with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 180μM to 9mM. This work validates the FBS-X strategy for identifying new anti-flaviviral hits targeting MTase, while Hel might not be an amenable target for fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). This approach proved to be a fast and efficient screening method for FBDD target validation and discovery of starting hits for the development of higher affinity molecules that bind to novel allosteric sites.</p>

<p>Acetylcholinesterase plays a crucial role in nerve-impulse transmission at cholinergic synapses. The apparent paradox that it displays high turnover despite its active site being buried raises cogent questions as to how the traffic of substrates and products to and from the active site can occur so rapidly in such circumstances. Here, a kinetic crystallography strategy aimed at structurally addressing the issue of product traffic in acetylcholinesterase is presented, in which UV-laser-induced cleavage of a photolabile precursor of the enzymatic product analogue arsenocholine, 'caged' arsenocholine, is performed in a temperature-controlled X-ray crystallography regime. The 'caged' arsenocholine was shown to bind at both the active and peripheral sites of acetylcholinesterase. UV irradiation of a complex with acetylcholinesterase during a brief temperature excursion from 100 K to room temperature is most likely to have resulted in a decrease in occupancy by the caged compound. Microspectrophotometric experiments showed that the caged compound had indeed been photocleaved. It is proposed that a fraction of the arsenocholine molecules released within the crystal had been expelled from both the active and the peripheral sites. Partial q-weighted difference refinement revealed a relative movement of the two domains in acetylcholinesterase after photolysis and the room-temperature excursion, resulting in an increase in the active-site gorge volume of 30% and 35% in monomers A and B of the asymmetric unit, respectively. Moreover, an alternative route to the active-site gorge of the enzyme appeared to open. This structural characterization of acetylcholinesterase 'at work' is consistent with the idea that choline exits from the enzyme after catalysis either via the gorge or via an alternative 'backdoor' trajectory.</p>

<p>The gene PA0785 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1, which is annotated as a probable acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase (acpD), has been cloned and heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme exhibits activity corresponding to that of azoreductase but not acpD. Each recombinant protein molecule has an estimated molecular mass of 23,050 Da and one non-covalently bound FMN as co-factor. This enzyme, now identified as azoreductase 1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (paAzoR1), is a flavodoxin-like protein with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa as determined by gel-filtration chromatography, indicating that the protein is likely to be tetrameric in solution. The three-dimensional structure of paAzoR1, in complex with the substrate methyl red, was solved at a resolution of 2.18 A by X-ray crystallography. The protein exists as a dimer of dimers in the crystal lattice, with two spatially separated active sites per dimer, and the active site of paAzoR1 was shown to be a well-conserved hydrophobic pocket formed between two monomers. The paAzoR1 enzyme is able to reduce different classes of azo dyes and activate several azo pro-drugs used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During azo reduction, FMN serves as a redox centre in the electron-transferring system by mediating the electron transfer from NAD(P)H to the azo substrate. The spectral properties of paAzoR1 demonstrate the hydrophobic interaction between FMN and the active site in the protein. The structure of the ligand-bound protein also highlights the pi-stacking interactions between FMN and the azo substrate.</p>

<p>Obtaining phase information for the solution of macromolecular structures is still one of the bottlenecks in X-ray crystallography. 5-Amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid (I3C), in which three covalently bound iodines form an equilateral triangle, was incorporated into proteins in order to obtain phases by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD). An improved binding capability compared with simple heavy-metal ions, ready availability, improved recognition of potential heavy-atom sites and low toxicity make I3C particularly suitable for experimental phasing.</p>

<p>Human type II hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/amyloid-beta binding alcohol dehydrogenase (HADH II/ABAD) is an oxidoreductase whose salient features include broad substrate specificity, encompassing 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA derivatives, hydroxysteroids, alcohols and beta-hydroxybutyrate, and the capacity to bind amyloid-beta peptide, leading to propagation of amyloid-induced cell stress. In this study, we examine the structure and enzymatic activity of the homologous rat HADH II/ABAD enzyme. We report the crystal structure of rat HADH II/ABAD as a binary complex with its NADH cofactor to 2.0 A resolution, as a ternary complex with NAD(+) and 3-ketobutyrate (acetoacetate) to 1.4 A resolution, and as a ternary complex with NADH and 17 beta-estradiol to 1.7 A resolution. This first crystal structure of an HADH II confirms these enzymes are closely related to the short-chain hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and differ substantially from the classic, type I 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Binding of the ketobutyrate substrate is accompanied by closure of the active site specificity loop, whereas the steroid substrate does not appear to require closure for binding. Despite the different chemical nature of the two bound substrates, the presentation of chemical groups within the active site of each complex is remarkably similar, allowing a general mechanism for catalytic activity to be proposed. There is a characteristic extension to the active site that is likely to accommodate the CoA moiety of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA substrates. Rat HADH II/ABAD also binds amyloid-beta (1-40) peptide with a K(D) of 21 nM, which is similar to the interaction exhibited between this peptide and human HADH II/ABAD. These studies provide the first structural insights into HADH II/ABAD interaction with its substrates, and indicate the relevance of the rodent enzyme and associated rodent models for analysis of HADH II/ABAD's physiologic and pathophysiologic properties.</p>

<p>Fragment-based design was used to guide derivatization of a lead series of β-lactamase inhibitors that had heretofore resisted optimization for in vivo activity. X-ray structures of fragments overlaid with the lead suggested new, unanticipated functionality and points of attachment. Synthesis of three derivatives improved affinity over 20-fold and improved efficacy in cell culture. Crystal structures were consistent with the fragment-based design, enabling further optimization to a K(i) of 50 pM, a 500-fold improvement that required the synthesis of only six derivatives. One of these, compound 5, was tested in mice. Whereas cefotaxime alone failed to cure mice infected with β-lactamase-expressing Escherichia coli, 65% were cleared of infection when treated with a cefotaxime:5 combination. Fragment complexes offer a path around design hurdles, even for advanced molecules; the series described here may provide leads to overcome β-lactamase-based resistance, a key clinical challenge.</p>

<p>Optimization processes, such as evolution, are constrained by diminishing returns-the closer the optimum, the smaller the benefit per mutation, and by tradeoffs-improvement of one property at the cost of others. However, the magnitude and molecular basis of these parameters, and their effect on evolutionary transitions, remain unknown. Here we pursue a complete functional transition of an enzyme with a &gt;10(9)-fold change in the enzyme's selectivity using laboratory evolution. We observed strong diminishing returns, with the initial mutations conferring &gt;25-fold higher improvements than later ones, and asymmetric tradeoffs whereby the gain/loss ratio of the new/old activity decreased 400-fold from the beginning of the trajectory to its end. We describe the molecular basis for these phenomena and suggest they have an important role in shaping natural proteins. These findings also suggest that the catalytic efficiency and specificity of many natural enzymes may be far from their optimum.</p>

<p>A series of hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives have shown inhibitory activity against carbonic anhydrase (CA).

<p>Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases 1 and 2 (ERAP1 and ERAP2) cooperate to trim antigenic peptide precursors for loading onto MHC class I molecules and help regulate the adaptive immune response. Common coding single nucleotide polymorphisms in ERAP1 and ERAP2 have been linked with predisposition to human diseases ranging from viral and bacterial infections to autoimmunity and cancer. It has been hypothesized that altered Ag processing by these enzymes is a causal link to disease etiology, but the molecular mechanisms are obscure. We report in this article that the common ERAP2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs2549782 that codes for amino acid variation N392K leads to alterations in both the activity and the specificity of the enzyme. Specifically, the 392N allele excises hydrophobic N-terminal residues from epitope precursors up to 165-fold faster compared with the 392K allele, although both alleles are very similar in excising positively charged N-terminal amino acids. These effects are primarily due to changes in the catalytic turnover rate (k(cat)) and not in the affinity for the substrate. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the ERAP2 392K allele suggests that the polymorphism interferes with the stabilization of the N terminus of the peptide both directly and indirectly through interactions with key residues participating in catalysis. This specificity switch allows the 392N allele of ERAP2 to supplement ERAP1 activity for the removal of hydrophobic N-terminal residues. Our results provide mechanistic insight to the association of this ERAP2 polymorphism with disease and support the idea that polymorphic variation in Ag processing enzymes constitutes a component of immune response variability in humans.</p>

<p>(19)F NMR screening of fluorinated fragments with different Local Environment of Fluorine, a.k.a. LEF library, is an experimental methodology which, beyond providing useful starting fragments for fragment-based drug discovery projects, offers, in combination with crystal and computational analysis, an approach for the identification of fluorophilic hot-spots in the proteins of interest. The application of this approach in the identification of fluorinated fragments binding to the serine protease trypsin, and the X-ray structures of the complexes are presented. The specific nature of the observed fluorine-protein interactions is discussed and compared with the interactions detected for other fluorinated ligands reported in the protein data bank. The presence of similar 3D arrangements of protein atoms at the fluorine sub-sites is identified with a newly developed tool. In this approach, protein sub-sites are extracted around each fluorine contained in the protein data bank and compared with the query of interest by using a pharmacophoric description.</p>

<p>Pyrabactin is a synthetic abscisic acid (ABA) agonist that selectively inhibits seed germination. The use of pyrabactin was pivotal in the identification of the PYR1/PYL/RCAR family (PYL) of proteins as the ABA receptor. Although they both act through PYL proteins, pyrabactin and ABA share no apparent chemical or structural similarity. It remains unclear how pyrabactin functions as an ABA agonist. Here, we report the crystal structure of pyrabactin in complex with PYL1 at 2.4 A resolution. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that recognition of pyrabactin by the pocket residues precedes the closure of switch loop CL2. Structural comparison between pyrabactin- and ABA-bound PYL1 reveals a general principle in the arrangements of function groups of the two distinct ligands. The study provides a framework for the development of novel ABA agonists that may have applicable potentials in agriculture.</p>

<p>The mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) harbors disulfide bond-generating enzymes, including Ero1α and peroxiredoxin 4 (Prx4), and nearly 20 members of the protein disulfide isomerase family (PDIs), which together constitute a suitable environment for oxidative protein folding. Here, we clarified the Prx4 preferential recognition of two PDI family proteins, P5 and ERp46, and the mode of interaction between Prx4 and P5 thioredoxin domain. Detailed analyses of oxidative folding catalyzed by the reconstituted Prx4-PDIs pathways demonstrated that, while P5 and ERp46 are dedicated to rapid, but promiscuous, disulfide introduction, PDI is an efficient proofreader of non-native disulfides. Remarkably, the Prx4-dependent formation of native disulfide bonds was accelerated when PDI was combined with ERp46 or P5, suggesting that PDIs work synergistically to increase the rate and fidelity of oxidative protein folding. Thus, the mammalian ER seems to contain highly systematized oxidative networks for the efficient production of large quantities of secretory proteins. </p>

<p>The crystal structures of mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis RecA (MsRecA) involving changes of Gln196 from glutamine to alanine, asparagine and glutamic acid, wild-type MsRecA and several of their nucleotide complexes have been determined using mostly low-temperature and partly room-temperature X-ray data. At both temperatures, nucleotide binding results in a movement of Gln196 towards the bound nucleotide in the wild-type protein. This movement is abolished in the mutants, thus establishing the structural basis for the triggering action of the residue in terms of the size, shape and the chemical nature of the side chain. The 19 crystal structures reported here, together with 11 previously reported MsRecA structures, provide further elaboration of the relation between the pitch of the ;inactive' RecA filament, the orientation of the C-terminal domain with respect to the main domain and the location of the switch residue. The low-temperature structures define one extreme of the range of positions the C-terminal domain can occupy. The movement of the C-terminal domain is correlated with those of the LexA-binding loop and the loop that connects the main and the N-terminal domains. These elements of molecular plasticity are made use of in the transition to the ;active' filament, as evidenced by the recently reported structures of RecA-DNA complexes. The available structures of RecA resulting from X-ray and electron-microscopic studies appear to represent different stages in the trajectory of the allosteric transformations of the RecA filament. The work reported here contributes to the description of the early stages of this trajectory and provides insight into structures relevant to the later stages.</p>

<p>D-serine is an endogenous coagonist for the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and is involved in excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. Mammalian pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent serine racemase, which is localized in the mammalian brain, catalyzes the racemization of L-serine to yield D-serine and vice versa. The enzyme also catalyzes the dehydration of D- and L-serine. Both reactions are enhanced by Mg.ATP in vivo. We have determined the structures of the following three forms of the mammalian enzyme homolog from Schizosaccharomyces pombe: the wild-type enzyme, the wild-type enzyme in the complex with an ATP analog, and the modified enzyme in the complex with serine at 1.7, 1.9, and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. On binding of the substrate, the small domain rotates toward the large domain to close the active site. The ATP binding site was identified at the domain and the subunit interface. Computer graphics models of the wild-type enzyme complexed with L-serine and D-serine provided an insight into the catalytic mechanisms of both reactions. Lys-57 and Ser-82 located on the protein and solvent sides, respectively, with respect to the cofactor plane, are acid-base catalysts that shuttle protons to the substrate. The modified enzyme, which has a unique "lysino-D-alanyl" residue at the active site, also exhibits catalytic activities. The crystal-soaking experiment showed that the substrate serine was actually trapped in the active site of the modified enzyme, suggesting that the lysino-D-alanyl residue acts as a catalytic base in the same manner as inherent Lys-57 of the wild-type enzyme.</p>

<p>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductases (MTHFRs; EC 1.7.99.5) catalyze the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH(2)-H(4)folate) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH(3)-H(4)folate) using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor. The initial X-ray structure of Escherichia coli MTHFR revealed that this 33-kDa polypeptide is a (betaalpha)(8) barrel that aggregates to form an unusual tetramer with only 2-fold symmetry. Structures of reduced enzyme complexed with NADH and of oxidized Glu28Gln enzyme complexed with CH(3)-H(4)folate have now been determined at resolutions of 1.95 and 1.85 A, respectively. The NADH complex reveals a rare mode of dinucleotide binding; NADH adopts a hairpin conformation and is sandwiched between a conserved phenylalanine, Phe223, and the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. The nicotinamide of the bound pyridine nucleotide is stacked against the si face of the flavin ring with C4 adjoining the N5 of FAD, implying that this structure models a complex that is competent for hydride transfer. In the complex with CH(3)-H(4)folate, the pterin ring is also stacked against FAD in an orientation that is favorable for hydride transfer. Thus, the binding sites for the two substrates overlap, as expected for many enzymes that catalyze ping-pong reactions, and several invariant residues interact with both folate and pyridine nucleotide substrates. Comparisons of liganded and substrate-free structures reveal multiple conformations for the loops beta2-alpha2 (L2), beta3-alpha3 (L3), and beta4-alpha4 (L4) and suggest that motions of these loops facilitate the ping-pong reaction. In particular, the L4 loop adopts a "closed" conformation that allows Asp120 to hydrogen bond to the pterin ring in the folate complex but must move to an "open" conformation to allow NADH to bind.</p>

<p>Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a variety of human infections, including life-threatening, systemic conditions. Secreted proteome, including a range of proteases, constitutes the major virulence factor of the bacterium. However, the functions of individual enzymes, in particular SplA protease, remain poorly characterized. Here, we report development of specific inhibitors of SplA protease. The design, synthesis, and activity of a series of α-aminoalkylphosphonate diaryl esters and their peptidyl derivatives are described. Potent inhibitors of SplA are reported, which may facilitate future investigation of physiological function of the protease. The binding modes of the high-affinity compounds Cbz-Phe(P) -(OC6 H4 -4-SO2 CH3 )2 and Suc-Val-Pro-Phe(P) -(OC6 H5 )2 are revealed by high-resolution crystal structures of complexes with the protease. Surprisingly, the binding mode of both compounds deviates from previously characterized canonical interaction of α-aminoalkylphosphonate peptidyl derivatives and family S1 serine proteases. </p>

<p>Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a large family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP and are implicated in various diseases. We describe the high-resolution crystal structures of the catalytic domains of PDE4B, PDE4D, and PDE5A with ten different inhibitors, including the drug candidates cilomilast and roflumilast, for respiratory diseases. These cocrystal structures reveal a common scheme of inhibitor binding to the PDEs: (i) a hydrophobic clamp formed by highly conserved hydrophobic residues that sandwich the inhibitor in the active site; (ii) hydrogen bonding to an invariant glutamine that controls the orientation of inhibitor binding. A scaffold can be readily identified for any given inhibitor based on the formation of these two types of conserved interactions. These structural insights will enable the design of isoform-selective inhibitors with improved binding affinity and should facilitate the discovery of more potent and selective PDE inhibitors for the treatment of a variety of diseases.</p>

<p>The main difficulty in the development of ATP antagonist kinase inhibitors is target specificity, since the ATP-binding motif is present in many proteins. We introduce a strategy that has allowed us to identify compounds from a kinase inhibitor library that block the cyclin-dependent kinases responsible for regulating transcription, i.e., CDK7 and especially CDK9. The screening cascade employs cellular phenotypic assays based on mitotic index and nuclear p53 protein accumulation. This permitted us to classify compounds into transcriptional, cell cycle, and mitotic inhibitor groups. We describe the characterization of the transcriptional inhibitor class in terms of kinase inhibition profile, cellular mode of action, and selectivity for transformed cells. A structural selectivity rationale was used to optimize potency and biopharmaceutical properties and led to the development of a transcriptional inhibitor, 3,4-dimethyl-5-[2-(4-piperazin-1-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-3H-thiazol-2-one, with anticancer activity in animal models.</p>

<p>Co-crystallisation of the imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine derivative 15 (3-chloro-N-(4-morpholinophenyl)-6-(pyridin-3-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine) with Aurora-A provided an insight into the interactions of this class of compound with Aurora kinases. This led to the design and synthesis of potent Aurora-A inhibitors demonstrating up to 70-fold selectivity in cell-based Aurora kinase pharmacodynamic biomarker assays.</p>

<p>The structure of a chromosomal extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) having the ability to hydrolyze cephalosporins including cefuroxime and ceftazidime has been determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.75 A resolution. The species-specific class A beta-lactamase from Proteus vulgaris K1 was crystallized at pH 6.25 and its structure solved by molecular replacement. Refinement of the model resulted in crystallographic R and R(free) of 16.9 % and 19.3 %, respectively. The folding of the K1 enzyme is broadly similar to that of non-ESBL TEM-type beta-lactamases (2 A rmsd for C(alpha)) and differs by only 0.35 A for all atoms of six conserved residues in the catalytic site. Other residues promoting extended-spectrum activity in K1 include the side-chains of atypical residues Ser237 and Lys276. These side-chains are linked by two water molecules, one of which lies in the position normally filled by the guanidinium group of Arg244, present in most non-ESBL enzymes but absent from K1. The ammonium group of Lys276, ca 3.5 A from the virtual Arg244 guanidinium position, may interact with polar R2 substitutents on the dihydrothiazene ring of cephalosporins.</p>

<p>The increasing incidence of inducible chromosomal AmpC β-lactamases within the clinic is a growing concern because these enzymes deactivate a broad range of even the most recently developed β-lactam antibiotics. As a result, new strategies are needed to block the action of this antibiotic resistance enzyme. Presented here is a strategy to combat the action of inducible AmpC by inhibiting the β-glucosaminidase NagZ, which is an enzyme involved in regulating the induction of AmpC expression. A divergent route facilitating the rapid synthesis of a series of N-acyl analogues of 2-acetamido-2-deoxynojirimycin is reported here. Among these compounds are potent NagZ inhibitors that are selective against functionally related human enzymes. These compounds reduce minimum inhibitory concentration values for β-lactams against a clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterium bearing inducible chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The structure of a NagZ-inhibitor complex provides insight into the molecular basis for inhibition by these compounds. </p>

<p>Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis begins with an asymmetric cell division producing two genetically identical cells with different fates. SpoIIE is a membrane protein that localizes to the polar cell division sites where it causes FtsZ to relocate from mid-cell to form polar Z-rings. Following polar septation, SpoIIE establishes compartment-specific gene expression in the smaller forespore cell by dephosphorylating the anti-sigma factor antagonist SpoIIAA, leading to the release of the RNA polymerase sigma factor σ(F) from an inhibitory complex with the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB. SpoIIE therefore couples morphological development to differential gene expression. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the phosphatase domain of SpoIIE to 2.6 Å spacing, revealing a domain-swapped dimer. SEC-MALLS (size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering) analysis however suggested a monomer as the principal form in solution. A model for the monomer was derived from the domain-swapped dimer in which 2 five-stranded β-sheets are packed against one another and flanked by α-helices in an αββα arrangement reminiscent of other PP2C-type phosphatases. A flap region that controls access of substrates to the active site in other PP2C phosphatases is diminished in SpoIIE, and this observation correlates with the presence of a single manganese ion in the active site of SpoIIE in contrast to the two or three metal ions present in other PP2C enzymes. Mapping of a catalogue of mutational data onto the structure shows a clustering of sites whose point mutation interferes with the proper coupling of asymmetric septum formation to sigma factor activation and identifies a surface involved in intramolecular signaling.</p>

<p>A 1.5 Å resolution X-ray structure of the catalytic module of Caldicellulosiruptor bescii family 3 pectate lyase is reported (PDB entry 3t9g). The resulting structure was refined to an R factor of 0.143 and an R(free) of 0.178. Structural analysis shows that this new structure is very similar to the previously solved structure of a family 3 pectate lyase from Bacillus sp. strain KSM-P15 (PDB entry 1ee6), with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.93 Å and a sequence identity of 53%. This structural similarity is significant considering that C. bescii is a hyperthermophile and Bacillus sp. is a mesophile.</p>

<p>Phosphodiesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the intracellular second messenger 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) into the corresponding 5'-nucleotide. Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), the major cAMP-specific PDE in inflammatory and immune cells, is an attractive target for the treatment of asthma and COPD. We have determined crystal structures of the catalytic domain of PDE4B complexed with AMP (2.0 A), 8-Br-AMP (2.13 A) and the potent inhibitor rolipram (2.0 A). All the ligands bind in the same hydrophobic pocket and can interact directly with the active site metal ions. The identity of these metal ions was examined using X-ray anomalous difference data. The structure of the AMP complex confirms the location of the catalytic site and allowed us to speculate about the detailed mechanism of catalysis. The high-resolution structures provided the experimental insight into the nucleotide selectivity of phosphodiesterase. 8-Br-AMP binds in the syn conformation to the enzyme and demonstrates an alternative nucleotide-binding mode. Rolipram occupies much of the AMP-binding site and forms two hydrogen bonds with Gln443 similar to the nucleotides.</p>

<p>CK2 is a very pleiotropic protein kinase whose high constitutive activity is suspected to cooperate to neoplasia. Here, the crystal structure of the complexes between CK2 and three selective tetrabromo-benzimidazole derivatives inhibiting CK2 with Ki values between 40 and 400 nM are presented. The ligands bind to the CK2 active site in a different way with respect to the parent compound TBB. They enter more deeply into the cavity, establishing halogen bonds with the backbone of Glu114 and Val116 in the hinge region. A detailed analysis of the interactions highlights a major role of the hydrophobic effect in establishing the rank of potency within this class of inhibitors and shows that polar interactions are responsible for the different orientation of the molecules in the active site.</p>

<p>The structure of a malonate-bound form of the glycerophosphodiesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes, GpdQ, has been refined at a resolution of 2.2 A to a final R factor of 17.1%. The structure was originally solved to 2.9 A resolution using SAD phases from Zn2+ metal ions introduced into the active site of the apoenzyme [Jackson et al. (2007), J. Mol. Biol. 367, 1047-1062]. However, the 2.9 A resolution was insufficient to discern significant details of the architecture of the binuclear metal centre that constitutes the active site. Furthermore, kinetic analysis revealed that the enzyme lost a significant amount of activity in the presence of Zn2+, suggesting that it is unlikely to be a catalytically relevant metal ion. In this communication, a higher resolution structure of GpdQ is presented in which malonate is visibly coordinated in the active site and analysis of the native metal-ion preference is presented using atomic absorption spectroscopy and anomalous scattering. Catalytic implications of the structure and its Fe2+ metal-ion preference are discussed.</p>

<p>Trehalose synthase (TreS) catalyzes the reversible conversion of maltose into trehalose in mycobacteria as one of three biosynthetic pathways to this nonreducing disaccharide. Given the importance of trehalose to survival of mycobacteria, there has been considerable interest in understanding the enzymes involved in its production; indeed the structures of the key enzymes in the other two pathways have already been determined. Herein, we present the first structure of TreS from Mycobacterium smegmatis, thereby providing insights into the catalytic machinery involved in this intriguing intramolecular reaction. This structure, which is of interest both mechanistically and as a potential pharmaceutical target, reveals a narrow and enclosed active site pocket within which intramolecular substrate rearrangements can occur. We also present the structure of a complex of TreS with acarbose, revealing a hitherto unsuspected oligosaccharide-binding site within the C-terminal domain. This may well provide an anchor point for the association of TreS with glycogen, thereby enhancing its role in glycogen biosynthesis and degradation. </p>

<p>Rhomboids are evolutionarily conserved serine proteases that cleave transmembrane proteins within the membrane. The increasing number of known rhomboid functions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes makes them attractive drug targets. Here, we describe structures of the Escherichia coli rhomboid GlpG in complex with β-lactam inhibitors. The inhibitors form a single bond to the catalytic serine and the carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor faces away from the oxyanion hole. The hydrophobic N-substituent of β-lactam inhibitors points into a cavity within the enzyme, providing a structural explanation for the specificity of β-lactams on rhomboid proteases. This same cavity probably represents the S2' substrate binding site of GlpG. We suggest that the structural changes in β-lactam inhibitor binding reflect the state of the enzyme at an initial stage of substrate binding to the active site. The structural insights from these enzyme-inhibitor complexes provide a starting point for structure-based design for rhomboid inhibitors.</p>

<p>Indanesulfonamides are interesting lead compounds for designing selective inhibitors of the different isoforms of the zinc enzyme Carbonic Anhydrase (CA). Herein, we report for the first time the X-ray crystal structure of two such derivatives, namely indane-5-sulfonamide and indane-2-valproylamido-5-sulfonamide, in complex with the physiologically dominant human isoform II. The structural analysis reveals that, although these two inhibitors have quite similar chemical structures, the arrangement of their indane ring within the enzyme active site is significantly diverse. Thus, our findings suggest that the introduction of bulky substituents on the indane-sulfonamide ring may alter the binding mode of this potent class of CA inhibitors, although retaining good inhibitory properties. Accordingly, the introduction of bulky tail moieties on the indane-sulfonamide scaffold may represent a powerful strategy to induce a desired physicochemical property to an aromatic sulfonamide or to obtain inhibitors with diverse inhibition profiles and selectivity for various mammalian CAs.</p>

<p>We have crystallized Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase and solved the structure of the native enzyme and of its complexes with two potent reversible inhibitors, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-(phenylmethyl)-9-acridinamine and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-(3-iodophenyl-methyl)-9-acridinamine--all three at 2.7 A resolution. The refined structure of D. melanogaster acetylcholinesterase is similar to that of vertebrate acetylcholinesterases, for example, human, mouse, and fish, in its overall fold, charge distribution, and deep active-site gorge, but some of the surface loops deviate by up to 8 A from their position in the vertebrate structures, and the C-terminal helix is shifted substantially. The active-site gorge of the insect enzyme is significantly narrower than that of Torpedo californica AChE, and its trajectory is shifted several angstroms. The volume of the lower part of the gorge of the insect enzyme is approximately 50% of that of the vertebrate enzyme. Upon binding of either of the two inhibitors, nine aromatic side chains within the active-site gorge change their conformation so as to interact with the inhibitors. Some differences in activity and specificity between the insect and vertebrate enzymes can be explained by comparison of their three-dimensional structures.</p>

<p>We used freeze trapping to stabilize the Michaelis complex of wild-type tryptophan synthase and the alpha-subunit substrate indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP) and determined its structure to 1. 8 A resolution. In addition, we determined the 1.4 A resolution structure of the complex with indole-3-propanole phosphate (IPP), a noncleavable IGP analogue. The interaction of the 3'-hydroxyl of IGP with the catalytic alphaGlu49 leads to a twisting of the propane chain and to a repositioning of the indole ring compared to IPP. Concomitantly, the catalytic alphaAsp60 rotates resulting in a translocation of the COMM domain [betaGly102-betaGly189, for definition see Schneider et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 5394-5406] in a direction opposite to the one in the IPP complex. This results in loss of the allosteric sodium ion bound at the beta-subunit and an opening of the beta-active site, thereby making the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) accessible to solvent and thus serine binding. These findings form the structural basis for the information transfer from the alpha- to the beta-subunit and may explain the affinity increase of the beta-active site for serine upon IGP binding.</p>

<p>Replicate it: Structures of KOD and 9°N DNA polymerases, two enzymes that are widely used to replicate DNA with highly modified nucleotides, were solved at high resolution in complex with primer/template duplex. The data elucidate substrate interaction of the two enzymes and pave the way for further optimisation of the enzymes and substrates.</p>

<p>Chemically diverse fragment hits of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were discovered by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) screening of our in-house fragment library. Site specific binding of the primary hits was confirmed in a competition setup using a high-affinity ATP-site inhibitor of FAK. Protein crystallography revealed the binding mode of 41 out of 48 selected fragment hits within the ATP-site. Structural comparison of the fragment binding modes with a DFG-out inhibitor of FAK initiated first synthetic follow-up optimization leading to improved binding affinity. </p>

<p>Quinone reductase 2 (QR2) is one of two members comprising the mammalian quinone reductase family of enzymes responsible for performing FAD mediated reductions of quinone substrates. In contrast to quinone reductase 1 (QR1) which uses NAD(P)H as its co-substrate, QR2 utilizes a rare group of hydride donors, N-methyl or N-ribosyl nicotinamide. Several studies have linked QR2 to the generation of quinone free radicals, several neuronal degenerative diseases, and cancer. QR2 has been also identified as the third melatonin receptor (MT3) through in cellulo and in vitro inhibition of QR2 by traditional MT3 ligands, and through recent X-ray structures of human QR2 (hQR2) in complex with melatonin and 2-iodomelatonin. Several MT3 specific ligands have been developed that exhibit both potent in cellulo inhibition of hQR2 nanomolar, affinity for MT3. The potency of these ligands suggest their use as molecular probes for hQR2. However, no definitive correlation between traditionally obtained MT3 ligand affinity and hQR2 inhibition exists limiting our understanding of how these ligands are accommodated in the hQR2 active site. To obtain a clearer relationship between the structures of developed MT3 ligands and their inhibitory properties, in cellulo and in vitro IC₅₀ values were determined for a representative set of MT3 ligands (MCA-NAT, 2-I-MCANAT, prazosin, S26695, S32797, and S29434). Furthermore, X-ray structures for each of these ligands in complex with hQR2 were determined allowing for a structural evaluation of the binding modes of these ligands in relation to the potency of MT3 ligands.</p>

<p>Tankyrases are poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases that have many cellular functions. They play pharmaceutically important roles, at least in telomere homeostasis and Wnt signaling, by covalently ADP-ribosylating target proteins and consequently regulating their functions. These features make tankyrases potential targets for treatment of cancer. We report here crystal structures of human tankyrase 2 catalytic fragment in complex with a byproduct, nicotinamide, and with selective inhibitors of tankyrases (IWR-1) and PARPs 1 and 2 (olaparib). Binding of these inhibitors to tankyrase 2 induces specific conformational changes. The crystal structures explain the selectivity of the inhibitors, reveal the flexibility of a substrate binding loop, and explain existing structure-activity relationship data. The first crystal structure of a PARP enzyme in complex with a potent inhibitor, IWR-1, that does not bind to the widely utilized nicotinamide-binding site makes the structure valuable for development of PARP inhibitors in general.</p>

<p>Allosteric regulation of protein function is critical for metabolic control. Binding of allosteric effectors elicits a functional change in a remote ligand binding site on a protein by altering the equilibrium between different forms in the protein ensemble. 3-Deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) catalyzes the first step in the shikimate pathway, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids Trp, Phe, and Tyr. Feedback regulation by the aromatic amino acids is important for controlling the cellular levels of the aromatic amino acids, and many organisms have two or more DAH7PS isozymes that show differing sensitivities to aromatic compounds. Mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses a single DAH7PS that is insensitive to the presence of a single amino acid yet shows extraordinary synergistic inhibition by combinations of the pathway end products Trp and Phe. The Trp+Phe-bound structure for M. tuberculosis DAH7PS, showing two separate binding sites occupied by Trp and Phe for each monomer of the tetrameric protein, was obtained by cocrystallization. Comparison of this structure with the ligand-free M. tuberculosis DAH7PS demonstrates that there is no significant change in conformation upon ligand binding, suggesting that contributions from altered dynamic properties of the enzyme may account for the allosteric inhibition. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrate that the inhibitor binding sites are in direct communication. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal different changes in dynamic fluctuations upon single ligand binding compared to dual ligand binding. These changes account for the cross-talk between inhibitor binding sites and the active site, simultaneously potentiating both dual ligand binding and diminution of catalytic function.</p>

<p>The biogenic amine histamine is an important pharmacological mediator involved in pathophysiological processes such as allergies and inflammations. Histamine H(1) receptor (H(1)R) antagonists are very effective drugs alleviating the symptoms of allergic reactions. Here we show the crystal structure of the H(1)R complex with doxepin, a first-generation H(1)R antagonist. Doxepin sits deep in the ligand-binding pocket and directly interacts with Trp 428(6.48), a highly conserved key residue in G-protein-coupled-receptor activation. This well-conserved pocket with mostly hydrophobic nature contributes to the low selectivity of the first-generation compounds. The pocket is associated with an anion-binding region occupied by a phosphate ion. Docking of various second-generation H(1)R antagonists reveals that the unique carboxyl group present in this class of compounds interacts with Lys 191(5.39) and/or Lys 179(ECL2), both of which form part of the anion-binding region. This region is not conserved in other aminergic receptors, demonstrating how minor differences in receptors lead to pronounced selectivity differences with small molecules. Our study sheds light on the molecular basis of H(1)R antagonist specificity against H(1)R.</p>

<p>Mutations that constitutively activate the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, including alterations in PI3K, PTEN, and AKT, are found in a variety of human cancers, implicating the PI3K lipid kinase as an attractive target for the development of therapeutic agents to treat cancer and other related diseases. In this study, we report on the combination of a novel organometallic kinase inhibitor scaffold with structure-based design to develop a PI3K inhibitor, called E5E2, with an IC 50 potency in the mid-low-nanomolar range and selectivity against a panel of protein kinases. We also show that E5E2 inhibits phospho-AKT in human melanoma cells and leads to growth inhibition. Consistent with a role for the PI3K pathway in tumor cell invasion, E5E2 treatment also inhibits the migration of melanoma cells in a 3D spheroid assay. The structure of the PI3Kgamma/E5E2 complex reveals the molecular features that give rise to this potency and selectivity toward lipid kinases with implications for the design of a subsequent generation of PI3K-isoform-specific organometallic inhibitors.</p>

<p>The commonly used anti-cancer drug chlorambucil is the primary treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Chlorambucil has been shown to be detoxified by human glutathione transferase Pi (GST P1-1), an enzyme that is often found over-expressed in cancer tissues. The allelic variants of GST P1-1 are associated with differing susceptibilities to leukaemia and differ markedly in their efficiency in catalysing glutathione (GSH) conjugation reactions. Here, we perform detailed kinetic studies of the allelic variants with the aid of three representative co-substrates. We show that the differing catalytic properties of the variants are highly substrate-dependent. We show also that all variants exhibit the same temperature stability in the range 10 degrees C to 45 degrees C. We have determined the crystal structures of GST P1-1 in complex with chlorambucil and its GSH conjugate for two of these allelic variants that have different residues at positions 104 and 113. Chlorambucil is found to bind in a non-productive mode to the substrate-binding site (H-site) in the absence of GSH. This result suggests that under certain stress conditions where GSH levels are low, GST P1-1 can inactivate the drug by sequestering it from the surrounding medium. However, in the presence of GSH, chlorambucil binds in the H-site in a productive mode and undergoes a conjugation reaction with GSH present in the crystal. The crystal structure of the GSH-chlorambucil complex bound to the *C variant is identical with the *A variant ruling out the hypothesis that primary structure differences between the variants cause structural changes at the active site. Finally, we show that chlorambucil is a very poor inhibitor of the enzyme in contrast to ethacrynic acid, which binds to the enzyme in a similar fashion but can act as both substrate and inhibitor.</p>

<p>The structures of Helicobacter pylori (HPC) and Penicillium vitale (PVC) catalases, each with two subunits in the crystal asymmetric unit, oxidized with peroxoacetic acid are reported at 1.8 and 1.7 A resolution, respectively. Despite the similar oxidation conditions employed, the iron-oxygen coordination length is 1.72 A for PVC, close to what is expected for a Fe=O double bond, and 1.80 and 1.85 A for HPC, suggestive of a Fe-O single bond. The structure and electronic configuration of the oxoferryl heme and immediate protein environment is investigated further by QM/MM density functional theory calculations. Four different active site electronic configurations are considered, Por*+-FeIV=O, Por*+-FeIV=O...HisH+, Por*+-FeIV-OH+ and Por-FeIV-OH (a protein radical is assumed in the latter configuration). The electronic structure of the primary oxidized species, Por*+-FeIV=O, differs qualitatively between HPC and PVC with an A2u-like porphyrin radical delocalized on the porphyrin in HPC and a mixed A1u-like "fluctuating" radical partially delocalized over the essential distal histidine, the porphyrin, and, to a lesser extent, the proximal tyrosine residue. This difference is rationalized in terms of HPC containing heme b and PVC containing heme d. It is concluded that compound I of PVC contains an oxoferryl Por*+-FeIV=O species with partial protonation of the distal histidine and compound I of HPC contains a hydroxoferryl Por-FeIV-OH with the second oxidation equivalent delocalized as a protein radical. The findings support the idea that there is a relation between radical migration to the protein and protonation of the oxoferryl bond in catalase.</p>

<p>Family 18 chitinases play key roles in the life cycles of a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to man. Very recently it has been shown that one of the mammalian chitinases is highly overexpressed in the asthmatic lung and contributes to the pathogenic process through recruitment of inflammatory cells. Although several potent natural product chitinase inhibitors have been identified, their chemotherapeutic potential or their use as cell biological tools is limited due to their size, complex chemistry, and limited availability. We describe a virtual screening-based approach to identification of a novel, purine-based, chitinase inhibitor. This inhibitor acts in the low micromolar (Ki=2.8+/-0.2 microM) range in a competitive mode. Dissection of the binding mode by x-ray crystallography reveals that the compound, which consists of two linked caffeine moieties, binds in the active site through extensive and not previously observed stacking interactions with conserved, solvent exposed tryptophans. Such exposed aromatics are also present in the structures of many other carbohydrate processing enzymes. The compound exhibits favorable chemical properties and is likely to be useful as a general scaffold for development of pan-family 18 chitinase inhibitors.</p>

<p>The external layer of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane is primarily composed of a protective, selectively permeable LPS. The biosynthesis of LPS relies on UDP-3-O-acyl-glucosamine N-acyltransferase (LpxD), which transfers 3-hydroxy-arachidic acid from acyl carrier protein to the 2' amine of UDP-3-O-myristoyl glucosamine in Chlamydia trachomatis. Our crystallographic study reveals that LpxD is a homotrimer, each subunit of which is constructed from a novel combination of an N-terminal uridine-binding domain, a core lipid-binding domain, and a C-terminal helical extension. Highly conserved residues dominate nucleotide binding. Phe-43 and Tyr-49 form pi-stacking interactions with uracil, and Asn-46 and His-284 form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups. These interactions place the glucosamine moiety at the catalytic center formed by two adjacent subunits. Here His-247 and His-284 contribute to a mechanism involving nucleophilic attack by the amine of one substrate on the carbonyl carbon of an acyl carrier protein thioester conjugate. Serendipitously, our study reveals a fatty acid (FA) binding groove near the catalytic center. MS elucidated the presence of a FA mixture binding to LpxD, with palmitic acid the most prevalent. The placement of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and the FA provides details of N-acyltransferase ligand interactions and allows for a description of structure and reactivity at an early stage of LPS assembly.</p>

<p>The quinoprotein aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH) uses a covalently bound tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor to oxidatively deaminate primary aromatic amines. Recent crystal structures have provided insight into the reductive half-reaction. In contrast, no atomic details are available for the oxidative half-reaction. The TTQ O7 hydroxyl group is protonated during reduction, but it is unclear how this proton can be removed during the oxidative half-reaction. Furthermore, compared with the electron transfer from the N-quinol form, electron transfer from the non-physiological O-quinol form to azurin is significantly slower. Here we report crystal structures of the O-quinol, N-quinol, and N-semiquinone forms of AADH. A comparison of oxidized and substrate reduced AADH species reveals changes in the TTQ-containing subunit, extending from residues in the immediate vicinity of the N-quinol to the putative azurin docking site, suggesting a mechanism whereby TTQ redox state influences interprotein electron transfer. In contrast, chemical reduction of the TTQ center has no significant effect on protein conformation. Furthermore, structural reorganization upon substrate reduction places a water molecule near TTQ O7 where it can act as proton acceptor. The structure of the N-semiquinone, however, is essentially similar to oxidized AADH. Surprisingly, in the presence of substrate a covalent N-semiquinone substrate adduct is observed. To our knowledge this is the first detailed insight into a complex, branching mechanism of quinone oxidation where significant structural reorganization upon reduction of the quinone center directly influences formation of the electron transfer complex and nature of the electron transfer process.</p>

<p>Ferritins are a family of proteins distributed widely in nature. In bacterial, plant, and animal cells, ferritin appears to serve as a soluble, bioavailable, and non-toxic form of iron provider. Ferritins from animal sources are heteropolymers composed of two types of subunit, H and L, which differ mainly by the presence (H) or absence (L) of active ferroxidase centres. We report the crystallographic structures of four human H apoferritin variants at a resolution of up to 1.5 Angstrom. Crystal derivatives using Zn(II) as redox-stable alternative for Fe(II), allows us to characterize the different metal-binding sites. The ferroxidase centre, which is composed of sites A and B, binds metal with a preference for the A site. In addition, distinct Zn(II)-binding sites were found in the 3-fold axes, 4-fold axes and on the cavity surface near the ferroxidase centre. To study the importance of the distance of the two metal atoms in the ferroxidase centre, single and double replacement of glutamate 27 (site A) and glutamate 107 (site B), the two axial ligands, by aspartate residues have been carried out. The consequences for metal binding and the correlation with Fe(II) oxidation rates are discussed.</p>

<p>Aminopeptidase N from Escherichia coli is a M1 class aminopeptidase with the active-site region related to that of thermolysin. The enzyme has unusual specificity, cleaving adjacent to the large, nonpolar amino acids Phe and Tyr but also cleaving next to the polar residues Lys and Arg. To try to understand the structural basis for this pattern of hydrolysis, the structure of the enzyme was determined in complex with the amino acids L-arginine, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan, and L-tyrosine. These amino acids all bind with their backbone atoms close to the active-site zinc ion and their side chain occupying the S1 subsite. This subsite is in the form of a cylinder, about 10 A in cross-section and 12 A in length. The bottom of the cylinder includes the zinc ion and a number of polar side chains that make multiple hydrogen-bonding and other interactions with the alpha-amino group and the alpha-carboxylate of the bound amino acid. The walls of the S1 cylinder are hydrophobic and accommodate the nonpolar or largely nonpolar side chains of Phe and Tyr. The top of the cylinder is polar in character and includes bound water molecules. The epsilon-amino group of the bound lysine side chain and the guanidinium group of arginine both make multiple hydrogen bonds to this part of the S1 site. At the same time, the hydrocarbon part of the lysine and arginine side chains is accommodated within the nonpolar walls of the S1 cylinder. This combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic binding surfaces explains the ability of ePepN to cleave Lys, Arg, Phe, and Tyr. Another favored substrate has Ala at the P1 position. The short, nonpolar side chain of this residue can clearly be bound within the hydrophobic part of the S1 cylinder, but the reason for its facile hydrolysis remains uncertain.</p>

<p>Cancer cells exhibit several unique metabolic phenotypes that are critical for cell growth and proliferation. Specifically, they overexpress the M2 isoform of the tightly regulated enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which controls glycolytic flux, and are highly dependent on de novo biosynthesis of serine and glycine. Here we describe a new rheostat-like mechanistic relationship between PKM2 activity and serine biosynthesis. We show that serine can bind to and activate human PKM2, and that PKM2 activity in cells is reduced in response to serine deprivation. This reduction in PKM2 activity shifts cells to a fuel-efficient mode in which more pyruvate is diverted to the mitochondria and more glucose-derived carbon is channelled into serine biosynthesis to support cell proliferation.</p>

<p>The streptogramin class of antibiotics act to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis, and their semisynthetic derivatives, such as dalfopristin-quinupristin (Synercid), are used to treat serious or life-threatening infections due to multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria. Acquired resistance of the nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium to the group A component of natural and semisynthetic streptogramin mixtures is a prerequisite for the streptogramin resistance phenotype and is mediated by a streptogramin acetyltransferase. The crystal structure of Vat(D), a streptogramin acetyltransferase from a human urinary isolate of E. faecium, has been determined as an apoenzyme and in complex with either acetyl-CoA or virginiamycin M1 and CoA. These structures illustrate the location and arrangement of residues at the active site, and point to His 82 as a residue that may function as a general base. The structural similarity of Vat(D) to the xenobiotic acetyltransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicates similarities in the catalytic mechanism for these enzymes as well as several shared and distinctive antibiotic binding interactions between these enzymes and their respective substrates. These results reveal the molecular basis for a reaction by which Gram-positive cocci acquire resistance to a last resort antibiotic.</p>

<p>Virtual and high-throughput screens (HTS) should have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but studies that prospectively and comprehensively compare them are rare. We undertook a parallel docking and HTS screen of 197861 compounds against cruzain, a thiol protease target for Chagas disease, looking for reversible, competitive inhibitors. On workup, 99% of the hits were eliminated as false positives, yielding 146 well-behaved, competitive ligands. These fell into five chemotypes: two were prioritized by scoring among the top 0.1% of the docking-ranked library, two were prioritized by behavior in the HTS and by clustering, and one chemotype was prioritized by both approaches. Determination of an inhibitor/cruzain crystal structure and comparison of the high-scoring docking hits to experiment illuminated the origins of docking false-negatives and false-positives. Prioritizing molecules that are both predicted by docking and are HTS-active yields well-behaved molecules, relatively unobscured by the false-positives to which both techniques are individually prone.</p>

<p>Class I alpha1,2-mannosidases (glycosylhydrolase family 47) are key enzymes in the maturation of N-glycans. This protein family includes two distinct enzymatically active subgroups. Subgroup 1 includes the yeast and human endoplasmic reticulum (ER) alpha1,2-mannosidases that primarily trim Man(9)GlcNAc(2) to Man(8)GlcNAc(2) isomer B whereas subgroup 2 includes mammalian Golgi alpha1,2-mannosidases IA, IB, and IC that trim Man(9)GlcNAc(2) to Man(5)GlcNAc(2) via Man(8)GlcNAc(2) isomers A and C. The structure of the catalytic domain of the subgroup 2 alpha1,2-mannosidase from Penicillium citrinum has been determined by molecular replacement at 2.2-A resolution. The fungal alpha1,2-mannosidase is an (alphaalpha)(7)-helix barrel, very similar to the subgroup 1 yeast (Vallée, F., Lipari, F., Yip, P., Sleno, B., Herscovics, A., and Howell, P. L. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 581-588) and human (Vallée, F., Karaveg, K., Herscovics, A., Moremen, K. W., and Howell, P. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 41287-41298) ER enzymes. The location of the conserved acidic residues of the catalytic site and the binding of the inhibitors, kifunensine and 1-deoxymannojirimycin, to the essential calcium ion are conserved in the fungal enzyme. However, there are major structural differences in the oligosaccharide binding site between the two alpha1,2-mannosidase subgroups. In the subgroup 1 enzymes, an arginine residue plays a critical role in stabilizing the oligosaccharide substrate. In the fungal alpha1,2-mannosidase this arginine is replaced by glycine. This replacement and other sequence variations result in a more spacious carbohydrate binding site. Modeling studies of interactions between the yeast, human and fungal enzymes with different Man(8)GlcNAc(2) isomers indicate that there is a greater degree of freedom to bind the oligosaccharide in the active site of the fungal enzyme than in the yeast and human ER alpha1,2-mannosidases.</p>

<p>Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes the disease cholera, controls virulence factor production and biofilm development in response to two extracellular quorum-sensing molecules, called autoinducers. The strongest autoinducer, called CAI-1 (for cholera autoinducer-1), was previously identified as (S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one. Biosynthesis of CAI-1 requires the enzyme CqsA. Here, we determine the CqsA reaction mechanism, identify the CqsA substrates as (S)-2-aminobutyrate and decanoyl coenzyme A, and demonstrate that the product of the reaction is 3-aminotridecan-4-one, dubbed amino-CAI-1. CqsA produces amino-CAI-1 by a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent acyl-CoA transferase reaction. Amino-CAI-1 is converted to CAI-1 in a subsequent step via a CqsA-independent mechanism. Consistent with this, we find cells release &gt; or =100 times more CAI-1 than amino-CAI-1. Nonetheless, V. cholerae responds to amino-CAI-1 as well as CAI-1, whereas other CAI-1 variants do not elicit a quorum-sensing response. Thus, both CAI-1 and amino-CAI-1 have potential as lead molecules in the development of an anticholera treatment.</p>

<p>Pain associated with inflammation involves prostaglandins synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA) through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways while thromboxane A(2) formed by platelets from AA via cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) mediates thrombosis. COX-1 and COX-2 are both targets of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) including aspirin whereas COX-2 activity is preferentially blocked by COX-2 inhibitors called coxibs. COXs are homodimers composed of identical subunits, but we have shown that only one subunit is active at a time during catalysis; moreover, many nsNSAIDS bind to a single subunit of a COX dimer to inhibit the COX activity of the entire dimer. Here, we report the surprising observation that celecoxib and other coxibs bind tightly to a subunit of COX-1. Although celecoxib binding to one monomer of COX-1 does not affect the normal catalytic processing of AA by the second, partner subunit, celecoxib does interfere with the inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin in vitro. X-ray crystallographic results obtained with a celecoxib/COX-1 complex show how celecoxib can bind to one of the two available COX sites of the COX-1 dimer. Finally, we find that administration of celecoxib to dogs interferes with the ability of a low dose of aspirin to inhibit AA-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation. COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib are widely used for pain relief. Because coxibs exhibit cardiovascular side effects, they are often prescribed in combination with low-dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis. Our studies predict that the cardioprotective effect of low-dose aspirin on COX-1 may be blunted when taken with coxibs.</p>

<p>Arylsulfatases require a maturating enzyme to perform a co- or posttranslational modification to form a catalytically essential formylglycine (FGly) residue. In organisms that live aerobically, molecular oxygen is used enzymatically to oxidize cysteine to FGly. Under anaerobic conditions, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical chemistry is used. Here we present the structures of an anaerobic sulfatase maturating enzyme (anSME), both with and without peptidyl-substrates, at 1.6-1.8 Å resolution. We find that anSMEs differ from their aerobic counterparts in using backbone-based hydrogen-bonding patterns to interact with their peptidyl-substrates, leading to decreased sequence specificity. These anSME structures from Clostridium perfringens are also the first of an AdoMet radical enzyme that performs dehydrogenase chemistry. Together with accompanying mutagenesis data, a mechanistic proposal is put forth for how AdoMet radical chemistry is coopted to perform a dehydrogenation reaction. In the oxidation of cysteine or serine to FGly by anSME, we identify D277 and an auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster as the likely acceptor of the final proton and electron, respectively. D277 and both auxiliary clusters are housed in a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain, termed SPASM domain, that contains homology to ~1,400 other unique AdoMet radical enzymes proposed to use [4Fe-4S] clusters to ligate peptidyl-substrates for subsequent modification. In contrast to this proposal, we find that neither auxiliary cluster in anSME bind substrate, and both are fully ligated by cysteine residues. Instead, our structural data suggest that the placement of these auxiliary clusters creates a conduit for electrons to travel from the buried substrate to the protein surface.</p>

<p>Protein-protein interactions based on linear motif (LM) recognition play roles in many cell regulatory processes. The E. coli sliding clamp is a protein mediator of replisome formation, which uses a common surface pocket composed of two subsites (I and II) to interact with LMs in multiple binding partners. A structural and thermodynamic dissection of sliding clamp-LM recognition has been performed, providing support for a sequential binding model. According to the model, a hydrophobic C-terminal LM dipeptide submotif acts as an anchor to establish initial contacts within subsite I, and this is followed by formation of a stabilizing hydrogen-bonding network between the flanking LM residues and subsite II. Differential solvation/desolvation during positioning of the submotifs is proposed as a driver for the sequential binding. Our model provides general insights into linear motif recognition and should guide the design of small-molecule inhibitors of the E. coli sliding clamp, an emerging antibacterial target. </p>

<p>Endonuclease VIII (Nei) of Escherichia coli is a DNA repair enzyme that excises oxidized pyrimidines from DNA. Nei shares with formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) sequence homology and a similar mechanism of action: the latter involves removal of the damaged base followed by two sequential beta-elimination steps. However, Nei differs significantly from Fpg in substrate specificity. We determined the structure of Nei covalently crosslinked to a 13mer oligodeoxynucleotide duplex at 1.25 A resolution. The crosslink is derived from a Schiff base intermediate that precedes beta-elimination and is stabilized by reduction with NaBH(4). Nei consists of two domains connected by a hinge region, creating a DNA binding cleft between domains. DNA in the complex is sharply kinked, the deoxyribitol moiety is bound covalently to Pro1 and everted from the duplex into the active site. Amino acids involved in substrate binding and catalysis are identified. Molecular modeling and analysis of amino acid conservation suggest a site for recognition of the damaged base. Based on structural features of the complex and site-directed mutagenesis studies, we propose a catalytic mechanism for Nei.</p>

<p>Carbonic anhydrase has been well studied structurally and functionally owing to its importance in respiration. A large number of X-ray crystallographic structures of carbonic anhydrase and its inhibitor complexes have been determined, some at atomic resolution. Structure determination of a sulfonamide-containing inhibitor complex has been carried out and the structure was refined at 0.9 A resolution with anisotropic atomic displacement parameters to an R value of 0.141. The structure is similar to those of other carbonic anhydrase complexes, with the inhibitor providing a fourth nonprotein ligand to the active-site zinc. Comparison of this structure with 13 other atomic resolution (higher than 1.25 A) isomorphous carbonic anhydrase structures provides a view of the structural similarity and variability in a series of crystal structures. At the center of the protein the structures superpose very well. The metal complexes superpose (with only two exceptions) with standard deviations of 0.01 A in some zinc-protein and zinc-ligand bond lengths. In contrast, regions of structural variability are found on the protein surface, possibly owing to flexibility and disorder in the individual structures, differences in the chemical and crystalline environments or the different approaches used by different investigators to model weak or complicated electron-density maps. These findings suggest that care must be taken in interpreting structural details on protein surfaces on the basis of individual X-ray structures, even if atomic resolution data are available.</p>

<p>A beta-1,3-glucanase gene, encoding a protein of 1,793 amino acids, was cloned from a strain of Paenibacillus sp. in this study. This large protein, designated as LamA, consists of many putative functional units, which include, from N to C terminus, a leader peptide, three repeats of the S-layer homologous module, a catalytic module of glycoside hydrolase family 16, four repeats of the carbohydrate-binding module of family CBM_4_9, and an analogue of coagulation factor Fa5/8C. Several truncated proteins, composed of the catalytic module with various organizations of the appended modules, were successfully expressed and characterized in this study. Data indicated that the catalytic module specifically hydrolyze beta-1,3- and beta-1,3-1,4-glucans. Also, laminaritriose was the major product upon endolytic hydrolysis of laminarin. The CBM repeats and Fa5/8C analogue substantially enhanced the hydrolyzing activity of the catalytic module, particularly toward insoluble complex substrates, suggesting their modulating functions in the enzymatic activity of LamA. Carbohydrate-binding assay confirmed the binding capabilities of the CBM repeats and Fa5/8C analogue to beta-1,3-, beta-1,3-1,4-, and even beta-1,4-glucans. These appended modules also enhanced the inhibition effect of the catalytic module on the growth of Candida albicans and Rhizoctonia solani.</p>

This combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic binding surfaces explains the ability of ePepN to cleave Lys, Arg, Phe, and Tyr. Another favored substrate has Ala at the P1 position. The short, nonpolar side chain of this residue can clearly be bound within the hydrophobic part of the S1 cylinder, but the reason for its facile hydrolysis remains uncertain.</p>

<p>The incidence of tuberculosis is increasing due to the appearance of new drug-resistant variants. A thorough understanding of the disease organism is essential in order to create more effective drugs. In an attempt to understand better the poorly studied lipid metabolism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), we identified and characterized its fatty acid β-oxidation complex (trifunctional enzyme (TFE)). TFE is an α(2)β(2) complex consisting of two types of polypeptides catalyzing three of the four reactions of the β-oxidation of fatty acids. The kinetic constants (k(cat) and K(m)) show that the complexed α chain is more active than the individual α chain. Crystal structures of Mtb TFE (mtTFE) reveal that the quaternary assembly is strikingly different from the already known Pseudomonas fragi TFE (pfTFE) assembly due to the presence of a helical insertion (LA5) in the mtTFE-β subunit. This helical insertion prevents the pfTFE mode of assembly, as it would clash with helix H9A of the TFE-α chain. The mtTFE assembly appears to be more rigid and results in a different substrate channeling path between the α and the β subunits. Structural comparisons suggest that the mtTFE active sites can accommodate bulkier fatty acyl chains than in pfTFE. Although another thiolase (FadA2), more closely related to human TFE-β/thiolase, is present in the Mtb genome, it does not form a complex with mtTFE-α. Extensive phylogenetic analyses show that there are at least four TFE subfamilies. Our studies highlight the molecular properties of mtTFE, significantly extending the structural knowledge on this type of very interesting multifunctional enzymes.</p>

<p>Two high-resolution structures of a double mutant of bacterial cholesterol oxidase in the presence or absence of a ligand, glycerol, are presented, showing the trajectory of glycerol as it binds in a Michaelis complex-like position in the active site. A group of three aromatic residues forces the oxidized isoalloxazine moiety to bend along the N5-N10 axis as a response to the binding of glycerol in the active site. Movement of these aromatic residues is only observed in the glycerol-bound structure, indicating that some tuning of the FAD redox potential is caused by the formation of the Michaelis complex during regular catalysis. This structural study suggests a possible mechanism of substrate-assisted flavin activation, improves our understanding of the interplay between the enzyme, its flavin cofactor and its substrate, and is of use to the future design of effective cholesterol oxidase inhibitors.</p>

<p>Determination of the crystal structure of human MetAP1 makes it possible, for the first time, to compare the structures of a Type I and a Type II methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) from the same organism. Comparison of the Type I enzyme with the previously reported complex of ovalicin with Type II MetAP shows that the active site of the former is reduced in size and would incur steric clashes with the bound inhibitor. This explains why ovalicin and related anti-angiogenesis inhibitors target Type II human MetAP but not Type I. The differences in both size and shape of the active sites between MetAP1 and MetAP2 also help to explain their different substrate specificity. In the presence of excess Co(2+), a third cobalt ion binds in the active site region, explaining why metal ions in excess can be inhibitory. Also, the N-terminal region of the protein contains three distinct Pro-x-x-Pro motifs, supporting the prior suggestion that this region of the protein may participate in binding to the ribosome.</p>

<p>Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) controls a key metabolic step in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. This step is the NAD-dependent oxidation of inosine 5' monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine 5' monophosphate, the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the guanine nucleotides. Two isoforms of IMPDH have been identified, one of which (type II) is significantly up- regulated in neoplastic and differentiating cells. As such, it has been identified as a major target in antitumor and immunosuppressive drug design. We present here the 2.9-A structure of a ternary complex of the human type II isoform of IMPDH. The complex contains the substrate analogue 6-chloropurine riboside 5'-monophosphate (6-Cl-IMP) and the NAD analogue selenazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide, the selenium derivative of the active metabolite of the antitumor drug tiazofurin. The enzyme forms a homotetramer, with the dinucleotide binding at the monomer-monomer interface. The 6 chloro-substituted purine base is dehalogenated, forming a covalent adduct at C6 with Cys-331. The dinucleotide selenazole base is stacked against the 6-Cl-IMP purine ring in an orientation consistent with the B-side stereochemistry of hydride transfer seen with NAD. The adenosine end of the ligand interacts with residues not conserved between the type I and type II isoforms, suggesting strategies for the design of isoform-specific agents.</p>

<p>Nucleoside hydrolases are key enzymes in the purine salvage pathway of Trypanosomatidae and are considered as targets for drug design. We previously reported the first x-ray structure of an inosine-adenosine-guanosine preferring nucleoside hydrolase (IAG-NH) from Trypanosoma vivax (). Here we report the 2.0-A crystal structure of the slow D10A mutant in complex with the inhibitor 3-deaza-adenosine and the 1.6-A crystal structure of the same enzyme in complex with a genuine substrate inosine. The enzyme-substrate complex shows the substrate bound to the enzyme in a different conformation from 3-deaza-adenosine and provides a snapshot along the reaction coordinate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The chemical groups on the substrate important for binding and catalysis are mapped. The 2'-OH, 3'-OH, and 5'-OH contribute 4.6, 7.5, and 5.4 kcal/mol to k(cat)/K(m), respectively. Specific interactions with the exocyclic groups on the purine ring are not required for catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that the purine specificity of the IAG-NHs is imposed by a parallel aromatic stacking interaction involving Trp(83) and Trp(260). The pH profiles of k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) indicate the existence of one or more proton donors, possibly involved in leaving group activation. However, mutagenesis of the active site residues around the nucleoside base and an alanine scan of a flexible loop near the active site fail to identify this general acid. The parallel aromatic stacking seems to provide the most likely alternative mechanism for leaving group activation.</p>

<p>IL-2-inducible tyrosine kinase (Itk) plays a key role in antigen receptor signaling in T cells and is considered an important target for anti-inflammatory drug discovery. In order to generate inhibitors with the necessary potency and selectivity, a compound that targeted cysteine 442 in the ATP binding pocket and with an envisaged irreversible mode of action was designed. We incorporated a high degree of molecular recognition and specific design features making the compound suitable for inhaled delivery. This study confirms the irreversible covalent binding of the inhibitor to the kinase by x-ray crystallography and enzymology while demonstrating potency, selectivity, and prolonged duration of action in in vitro biological assays. The biosynthetic turnover of the kinase was also examined as a critical factor when designing irreversible inhibitors for extended duration of action. The exemplified Itk inhibitor demonstrated inhibition of both TH1 and TH2 cytokines, was additive with fluticasone propionate, and inhibited cytokine release from human lung fragments. Finally, we describe an in vivo pharmacodynamic assay that allows rapid preclinical development without animal efficacy models. </p>

<p>The carbonic anhydrase II mutant His64Cys was prepared and applied to tethered alkyne/azide cycloaddition reactions. The azide component could be tethered to the enzyme surface through a disulfide bridge, while the alkyne component was reversibly coordinated through a sulfonamide anchor to the zinc ion in the original catalytic center of the enzyme. The incipient orientation of the reactants in the binding site and of the formed triazole product were characterized by crystallography. The reaction progression could be monitored by HPLC-MS analysis.</p>

<p>Angiogenesis inhibitors have gained much public attention recently as anti-cancer agents and several are currently in clinical trials, including angiostatin (Phase I, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA). We report here the bowl-shaped structure of angiostatin kringles 1-3, the first multi-kringle structure to be determined. All three kringle lysine-binding sites contain a bound bicine molecule of crystallization while the former of kringle 2 and kringle 3 are cofacial. Moreover, the separation of the kringle 2 and kringle 3 lysiner binding sites is sufficient to accommodate the alpha-helix of the 30 residue peptide VEK-30 found in the kringle 2/VEK-30 complex. Together the three kringles produce a central cavity suggestive of a unique domain where they may function in concert.</p>

<p>Azoreductases are well known for azo pro-drug activation by gut flora. We show that azoreductases have a wider role in drug metabolism than previously thought as they can also reduce and hence activate nitrofurazone. Nitrofurazone, a nitroaromatic drug, is a broad spectrum antibiotic which has until now been considered as activated in bacteria by nitroreductases. The structure of the azoreductase with nitrofurazone bound was solved at 2.08 Å and shows nitrofurazone in an active conformation. Based on the structural information, the kinetics and stoichiometry of nitrofurazone reduction by azoreductase from P. aeruginosa, we propose a mechanism of activation which accounts for the ability of azoreductases to reduce both azo and nitroaromatic drugs. This mode of activation can explain the cytotoxic side-effects of nitrofurazone through human azoreductase homologues.</p>

<p>The biological activity of catechol neurotransmitters such as dopamine in the synapse is modulated by transporters and enzymes. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; EC 2.1.1.6) inactivates neurotransmitters by catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to catechols in the presence of Mg²⁺. This pathway also inactivates L-DOPA, the standard therapeutic for Parkinson's disease. Depletion of catechol neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex has been linked to schizophrenia. The inhibition of COMT therefore promises improvements in the treatment of these diseases. The concept of bisubstrate inhibitors for COMT has been described previously. Here, ribose-modified bisubstrate inhibitors were studied. Three high-resolution crystal structures of COMT in complex with novel ribose-modified bisubstrate inhibitors confirmed the predicted binding mode but displayed subtle alterations at the ribose-binding site. The high affinity of the inhibitors can be convincingly rationalized from the structures, which document the possibility of removing and/or replacing the ribose 3'-hydroxyl group and provide a framework for further inhibitor design.</p>

<p>Cytochrome P450(SPα) (CYP152B1) isolated from Sphingomonas paucimobilis is the first P450 to be classified as a H(2)O(2)-dependent P450. P450(SPα) hydroxylates fatty acids with high α-regioselectivity. Herein we report the crystal structure of P450(SPα) with palmitic acid as a substrate at a resolution of 1.65 Å. The structure revealed that the C(α) of the bound palmitic acid in one of the alternative conformations is 4.5 Å from the heme iron. This conformation explains the highly selective α-hydroxylation of fatty acid observed in P450(SPα). Mutations at the active site and the F-G loop of P450(SPα) did not impair its regioselectivity. The crystal structures of mutants (L78F and F288G) revealed that the location of the bound palmitic acid was essentially the same as that in the WT, although amino acids at the active site were replaced with the corresponding amino acids of cytochrome P450(BSβ) (CYP152A1), which shows β-regioselectivity. This implies that the high regioselectivity of P450(SPα) is caused by the orientation of the hydrophobic channel, which is more perpendicular to the heme plane than that of P450(BSβ).</p>

<p>The crystal structure of wild-type endo-β-D-1,4-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) from the ascomycete Chrysonilia sitophila (CsMan5) has been solved at 1.40 Å resolution. The enzyme isolated directly from the source shows mixed activity as both an endo-glucanase and an endo-mannanase. CsMan5 adopts the (β/α)(8)-barrel fold that is well conserved within the GH5 family and has highest sequence and structural homology to the GH5 endo-mannanases. Superimposition with proteins of this family shows a unique structural arrangement of three surface loops of CsMan5 that stretch over the active centre, promoting an altered topography of the binding cleft. The most relevant feature results from the repositioning of a long loop at the extremity of the binding cleft, resulting in a shortened glycone-binding region with two subsites. The other two extended loops flanking the binding groove produce a narrower cleft compared with the wide architecture observed in GH5 homologues. Two aglycone subsites (+1 and +2) are identified and a nonconserved tryptophan (Trp271) at the +1 subsite may offer steric hindrance. Taken together, these findings suggest that the discrimination of mannan substrates is achieved through modified loop length and structure.</p>

<p>Humans host an intestinal population of microbes--collectively referred to as the gut microbiome--which encode the carbohydrate active enzymes, or CAZymes, that are absent from the human genome. These CAZymes help to extract energy from recalcitrant polysaccharides. The question then arises as to if and how the microbiome adapts to new carbohydrate sources when modern humans change eating habits. Recent metagenome analysis of microbiomes from healthy American, Japanese, and Spanish populations identified putative CAZymes obtained by horizontal gene transfer from marine bacteria, which suggested that human gut bacteria evolved to degrade algal carbohydrates-for example, consumed in form of sushi. We approached this hypothesis by studying such a polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) obtained by horizontal gene transfer by the gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. Transcriptomic and growth experiments revealed that the PUL responds to the polysaccharide porphyran from red algae, enabling growth on this carbohydrate but not related substrates like agarose and carrageenan. The X-ray crystallographic and biochemical analysis of two proteins encoded by this PUL, BACPLE_01689 and BACPLE_01693, showed that they are β-porphyranases belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 16 and 86, respectively. The product complex of the GH86 at 1.3 Å resolution highlights the molecular details of porphyran hydrolysis by this new porphyranase. Combined, these data establish experimental support for the argument that CAZymes and associated genes obtained from extrinsic microbes add new catabolic functions to the human gut microbiome.</p>

<p>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to the movement of substances across the membrane; conformational changes clearly play an important role in the transporter mechanism. Previously, we have shown that a dimer of MalK, the ATPase subunit of the maltose transporter from Escherichia coli, undergoes a tweezers-like motion in a transport cycle. The MalK monomer consists of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The two nucleotide-binding domains in a dimer are either open or closed, depending on whether ATP is present, while the regulatory domains maintain contacts to hold the dimer together. In this work, the structure of MalK in a posthydrolysis state is presented, obtained by cocrystallizing MalK with ATP-Mg(2+). ATP was hydrolyzed in the crystallization drop, and ADP-Mg(2+) was found in the resulting crystal structure. In contrast to the ATP-bound form where two ATP molecules are buried in a closed interface between the nucleotide-binding domains, the two nucleotide-binding domains of the ADP-bound form are open, indicating that ADP, unlike ATP, cannot stabilize the closed form. This conclusion is further supported by oligomerization studies of MalK in solution. At low protein concentrations, ATP promotes dimerization of MalK, whereas ADP does not. The structures of dimeric MalK in the nucleotide-free, ATP-bound, and ADP-bound forms provide a framework for understanding the nature of the conformational changes that occur in an ATP-binding cassette transporter hydrolysis cycle, as well as how conformational changes in MalK are coupled to solute transport.</p>

<p>Glutathione transferases (GSTs) from the tau class (GSTU) are unique to plants and have important roles in stress tolerance and the detoxification of herbicides in crops and weeds. A fluorodifen-induced GST isoezyme (GmGSTU4-4) belonging to the tau class was purified from Glycine max by affinity chromatography. This isoenzyme was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its structural and catalytic properties were investigated. The structure of GmGSTU4-4 was determined at 1.75 A resolution in complex with S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-glutathione (Nb-GSH). The enzyme adopts the canonical GST fold but with a number of functionally important differences. Compared with other plant GSTs, the three-dimensional structure of GmGSTU4-4 primarily shows structural differences in the hydrophobic substrate binding site, the linker segment and the C-terminal region. The X-ray structure identifies key amino acid residues in the hydrophobic binding site (H-site) and provides insights into the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. The isoenzyme was highly active in conjugating the diphenylether herbicide fluorodifen. A possible reaction pathway involving the conjugation of glutathione with fluorodifen is described based on site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies. A serine residue (Ser13) is present in the active site, at a position that would allow it to stabilise the thiolate anion of glutathione and enhance its nucleophilicity. Tyr107 and Arg111 present in the active site are important structural moieties that modulate the catalytic efficiency and specificity of the enzyme, and participate in k(cat) regulation by affecting the rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction. A hitherto undescribed ligand-binding site (L-site) located in a surface pocket of the enzyme was also found. This site is formed by conserved residues, suggesting it may have an important functional role in the transfer and delivery of bound ligands, presumably to specific protein receptors.</p>

<p>An understanding of the physiological and toxicological properties of borate and the utilization of boronic acids in drug development require a basic understanding of borate-enzyme chemistry. We report here the extension of our recent NMR studies indicating the formation of a ternary borate-alcohol-trypsin complex. Crystallographic and solution state NMR studies of porcine trypsin were performed in the presence of borate and either of three alcohols designed to bind to the S1 affinity subsite: 4-aminobutanol, guanidine-3-propanol, and 4-hydroxymethylbenzamidine. Quaternary complexes of trypsin, borate, S1-binding alcohol, and ethylene glycol (a cryoprotectant), as well as a ternary trypsin, borate, and ethylene glycol complex have been observed in the crystalline state. Borate forms ester bonds to Ser195, ethylene glycol (two bonds), and the S1-binding alcohol (if present). Spectra from (1)H and (11)B NMR studies confirm that these complexes also exist in solution and also provide evidence for the formation of ternary trypsin, borate, and S1-subsite alcohol complexes which are not observed in the crystals using our experimental protocols. Analysis of eight crystal structures indicates that formation of an active site borate complex is in all cases accompanied by a significant (approximately 4%) increase in the b-axis dimension of the unit cell. Presumably, our inability to observe the ternary complexes in the crystalline state arises from the lower stability of these complexes and consequent inability to overcome the constraints imposed by the lattice contacts. A mechanism for the coupling of the lattice contacts with the active site that involves a conformational rearrangement of Gln192 is suggested. The structures presented here represent the first crystallographic demonstration of covalent binding of an enzyme by borate.</p>

<p>A series of [(2-pyrimidinylthio)acetyl]benzenesulfonamides were designed and synthesized. Their binding affinities as inhibitors of several recombinant human carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thermal shift assay (TSA). A group of compounds containing a chlorine atom in the benzenesulfonamide ring were found to exhibit higher selectivity but lower binding affinity toward tested CAs. The crystal structures of selected compounds in complex with CA II were determined to atomic resolution. Docking studies were performed to compare the binding modes of experimentally determined crystallographic structures with computational prediction of the pyrimidine derivative binding to CA II. Several compounds bound to select CAs with single-digit nanomolar affinities and could be used as leads for inhibitor development toward a select CA isozyme.</p>

<p>The homologous human ABO(H) A and B blood group glycosyltransferases GTA and GTB have two mobile polypeptide loops surrounding their active sites that serve to allow substrate access and product egress and to recognize and sequester substrates for catalysis. Previous studies have established that these enzymes can move from the "open" state to the "semi-closed" then "closed" states in response to addition of a substrate. The contribution of electrostatic interactions to these conformational changes has now been demonstrated by the determination at various pH of the structures of GTA, GTB and the chimeric enzyme ABBA. At near-neutral pH, GTA displays the closed state in which both mobile loops order around the active site, whereas ABBA and GTB display the open state. At low pH, the apparent protonation of the DXD motif in GTA leads to the expulsion of the donor analog to yield the open state, whereas at high pH, both ABBA and GTB form the semi-closed state in which the first mobile loop becomes an ordered α-helix. Step-wise deprotonation of GTB in increments of 0.5 between pH 6.5 and 10.0 shows that helix ordering is gradual, which indicates that the formation of the semi-closed state is dependent on electrostatic forces consistent with the binding of substrate. Spectropolarimetric studies of the corresponding stand-alone peptide in solution reveal no tendency toward helix formation from pH 7.0 to 10.0, which shows that pH-dependent stability is a product of the larger protein environment and underlines the importance of substrate in active site ordering. </p>

<p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) catalyzes the bioactivation of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate, GTN) in blood vessels, resulting in vasodilation by nitric oxide (NO) or a related species. Because the mechanism of this reaction is still unclear we determined the three-dimensional structures of wild-type (WT) ALDH2 and of a triple mutant of the protein that exhibits low denitration activity (E268Q/C301S/C303S) in complex with GTN. The structure of the triple mutant showed that GTN binds to the active site via polar contacts to the oxyanion hole and to residues 268 and 301 as well as by van der Waals interactions to hydrophobic residues of the catalytic pocket. The structure of the GTN-soaked wild-type protein revealed a thionitrate adduct to Cys-302 as the first reaction intermediate, which was also found by mass spectrometry (MS) experiments. In addition, the MS data identified sulfinic acid as the irreversibly inactivated enzyme species. Assuming that the structures of the triple mutant and wild-type ALDH2 reflect binding of GTN to the catalytic site and the first reaction step, respectively, superposition of the two structures indicates that denitration of GTN is initiated by nucleophilic attack of Cys-302 at one of the terminal nitrate groups, resulting in formation of the observed thionitrate intermediate and release of 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate. Our results shed light on the molecular mechanism of the GTN denitration reaction and provide useful information on the structural requirements for high affinity binding of organic nitrates to the catalytic site of ALDH2.</p>

<p>L-threonine aldolases (L-TAs) represent a family of homologous pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes found in bacteria and fungi, and catalyse the reversible cleavage of several L-3-hydroxy-α-amino acids. L-TAs have great biotechnological potential, as they catalyse the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, and therefore may be exploited for the bioorganic synthesis of L-3-hydroxyamino acids that are biologically active or constitute building blocks for pharmaceutical molecules. Many L-TAs, showing different stereospecificity towards the Cβ configuration, have been isolated. Because of their potential to carry out diastereoselective syntheses, L-TAs have been subjected to structural, functional and mechanistic studies. Nevertheless, their catalytic mechanism and the structural bases of their stereospecificity have not been elucidated. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of low-specificity L-TA from Escherichia coli at 2.2-Å resolution, in the unliganded form and cocrystallized with L-serine and L-threonine. Furthermore, several active site mutants have been functionally characterized in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the molecular bases of stereospecificity. No active site catalytic residue was revealed, and a structural water molecule was assumed to act as the catalytic base in the retro-aldol cleavage reaction. Interestingly, the very large active site opening of E. coli L-TA suggests that much larger molecules than L-threonine isomers may be easily accommodated, and L-TAs may actually have diverse physiological functions in different organisms. Substrate recognition and reaction specificity seem to be guided by the overall microenvironment that surrounds the substrate at the enzyme active site, rather than by one ore more specific residues.</p>

<p>Species of the fungal genus Aspergillus are significant human and agricultural pathogens that are often refractory to existing antifungal treatments. Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase), a critical enzyme in eukaryotes, is an attractive potential target for antifungal drug discovery. We report high-resolution structures of A. fumigatus FTase (AfFTase) in complex with substrates and inhibitors. Comparison of structures with farnesyldiphosphate (FPP) bound in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, corresponding to successive steps in ordered substrate binding, revealed that the second substrate-binding step is accompanied by motions of a loop in the catalytic site. Re-examination of other FTase structures showed that this motion is conserved. The substrate- and product-binding clefts in the AfFTase active site are wider than in human FTase (hFTase). Widening is a consequence of small shifts in the α-helices that comprise the majority of the FTase structure, which in turn arise from sequence variation in the hydrophobic core of the protein. These structural effects are key features that distinguish fungal FTases from hFTase. Their variation results in differences in steady-state enzyme kinetics and inhibitor interactions and presents opportunities for developing selective anti-fungal drugs by exploiting size differences in the active sites. We illustrate the latter by comparing the interaction of ED5 and Tipifarnib with hFTase and AfFTase. In AfFTase, the wider groove enables ED5 to bind in the presence of FPP, whereas in hFTase it binds only in the absence of substrate. Tipifarnib binds similarly to both enzymes but makes less extensive contacts in AfFTase with consequently weaker binding. </p>

<p>Formylmethanofuran:tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase is an essential enzyme in the one-carbon metabolism of methanogenic and sulfate-reducing archaea and of methylotrophic bacteria. The enzyme, which is devoid of a prosthetic group, catalyzes the reversible formyl transfer between the two substrates coenzyme methanofuran and coenzyme tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) in a ternary complex catalytic mechanism. The structure of the formyltransferase without its coenzymes has been determined earlier. We report here the structure of the enzyme in complex with both coenzymes at a resolution of 2.0 A. Methanofuran, characterized for the first time in an enzyme structure, is embedded in an elongated cleft at the homodimer interface and fixed by multiple hydrophobic interactions. In contrast, tetrahydromethanopterin is only weakly bound in a shallow and wide cleft that provides two binding sites. It is assumed that the binding of the bulky coenzymes induces conformational changes of the polypeptide in the range of 3A that close the H4MPT binding cleft and position the reactive groups of both substrates optimally for the reaction. The key residue for substrate binding and catalysis is the strictly conserved Glu245. Glu245, embedded in a hydrophobic region and completely buried upon tetrahydromethanopterin binding, is presumably protonated prior to the reaction and is thus able to stabilize the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate generated by the nucleophilic attack of the N5 atom of tetrahydromethanopterin onto the formyl carbon atom of formylmethanofuran.</p>

<p>Two new crystal structures of Bacillus stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) afford evidence that a closed interdomain hinge angle requires a covalent bond between AMP and an occupant of either pyrophosphate or tryptophan subsite. They also are within experimental error of a cluster of structures observed in a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation showing partial active-site assembly. Further, the highest energy structure in a minimum action pathway computed by using elastic network models for Open and Pretransition state (PreTS) conformations for the fully liganded TrpRS monomer is intermediate between that simulated structure and a partially disassembled structure from a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics trajectory for the unliganded PreTS. These mutual consistencies provide unexpected validation of inferences drawn from molecular simulations.</p>

<p>Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases (ENGases) are dual specificity enzymes with an ability to catalyze hydrolysis and transglycosylation reactions. Recently, these enzymes have become the focus of intense research because of their potential for synthesis of glycopeptides. We have determined the 3D structures of an ENGase from Arthrobacter protophormiae (Endo-A) in 3 forms, one in native form, one in complex with Man(3)GlcNAc-thiazoline and another in complex with GlcNAc-Asn. The carbohydrate moiety sits above the TIM-barrel in a cleft region surrounded by aromatic residues. The conserved essential catalytic residues - E173, N171 and Y205 are within hydrogen bonding distance of the substrate. W216 and W244 regulate access to the active site during transglycosylation by serving as "gate-keepers". Interestingly, Y299F mutation resulted in a 3 fold increase in the transglycosylation activity. The structure provides insights into the catalytic mechanism of GH85 family of glycoside hydrolases at molecular level and could assist rational engineering of ENGases.</p>

<p>The rise of inhibitor-resistant and other β-lactamase variants is generating an interest in developing new β-lactamase inhibitors to complement currently available antibiotics. To gain insight into the chemistry of inhibitor recognition, we determined the crystal structure of the inhibitor preacylation complex of sulbactam, a clinical β-lactamase inhibitor, bound in the active site of the S70C variant of SHV-1 β-lactamase, a resistance enzyme that is normally present in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The S70C mutation was designed to affect the reactivity of that catalytic residue to allow for capture of the preacylation complex. Unexpectedly, the 1.45 Å resolution inhibitor complex structure revealed that residue C70 is involved in a sulfenamide bond with K73. Such a covalent bond is not present in the wild-type SHV-1 or in an apo S70C structure also determined in this study. This bond likely contributed significantly to obtaining the preacylation complex with sulbactam due to further decreased reactivity toward substrates. The intact sulbactam is positioned in the active site such that its carboxyl moiety interacts with R244, S130, and T235 and its carbonyl moiety is situated in the oxyanion hole. To our knowledge, in addition to being the first preacylation inhibitor β-lactamase complex, this is also the first observation of a sulfenamide bond between a cysteine and lysine in an active site. Not only could our results aid, therefore, structure-based inhibitor design efforts in class A β-lactamases, but the sulfenamide-bond forming approach to yield preacylation complexes could also be applied to other classes of β-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins with the SXXK motif.</p>

<p>Both in-house human genetic and literature data have converged on the identification of leukotriene 4 hydrolase (LTA(4)H) as a key target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. We combined fragment-based crystallography screening with an iterative medicinal chemistry effort to optimize inhibitors of LTA(4)H. Ligand efficiency was followed throughout our structure-activity studies. As applied within the context of LTA(4)H inhibitor design, the chemistry team was able to design a potent compound 20 (DG-051) (K(d) = 26 nM) with high aqueous solubility (&gt;30 mg/mL) and high oral bioavailability (&gt;80% across species) that is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of myocardial infarction and stroke. The structural biology-chemistry interaction described in this paper provides a sound alternative to conventional screening techniques. This is the first example of a gene-to-clinic paradigm enabled by a fragment-based drug discovery effort.</p>

<p>The thioredoxin system exists ubiquitously and participates in essential antioxidant and redox-regulation processes via a pair of conserved cysteine residues. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which lacks a genuine glutathione system, the thioredoxin system provides reducing equivalents inside the cell. The three-dimensional structure of thioredoxin reductase from M. tuberculosis has been determined at 3 A resolution. TLS refinement reveals a large libration axis, showing that NADPH-binding domain has large anisotropic disorder. The relative rotation of the NADPH domain with respect to the FAD domain is necessary for the thioredoxin reduction cycle, as it brings the spatially distant reacting sites close together. Normal-mode analysis carried out based on the elastic network model shows that the motion required to bring about the functional conformational change can be accounted for by motion along one single mode. TLS refinement and normal-mode analysis thus enhance our understanding of the associated conformational changes.</p>

<p>Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis is a thermophilic eubacterium that has a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) of 22 proteins. The general PTS proteins, enzyme I and HPr, and the transporters for N-acetylglucosamine (EIICB(GlcNAc)) and fructose (EIIBC(Fru)) have thermal unfolding transitions at ∼90 °C and a temperature optimum for in vitro sugar phosphotransferase activity of 65 °C. The phosphocysteine of a EIICB(GlcNAc) mutant is unusually stable at room temperature with a t(1/2) of 60 h. The PEP binding C-terminal domain of enzyme I (EIC) forms a metastable covalent adduct with PEP at 65 °C. Crystallization of this adduct afforded the 1.68 Å resolution structure of EIC with a molecule of pyruvate in the active site. We also report the 1.83 Å crystal structure of the EIC-PEP complex. The comparison of the two structures with the apo form and with full-length EI shows differences between the active site side chain conformations of the PEP and pyruvate states but not between the pyruvate and apo states. In the presence of PEP, Arg465 forms a salt bridge with the phosphate moiety while Glu504 forms salt bridges with Arg186 and Arg195 of the N-terminal domain of enzyme I (EIN), which stabilizes a conformation appropriate for the in-line transfer of the phosphoryl moiety from PEP to His191. After transfer, Arg465 swings 4.8 Å away to form an alternative salt bridge with the carboxylate of Glu504. Glu504 loses the grip of Arg186 and Arg195, and the EIN domain can swing away to hand on the phosphoryl group to the phosphoryl carrier protein HPr.</p>

<p>Prostaglandin H(2) (PGH(2)) formed from arachidonic acid is an unstable intermediate and is efficiently converted into more stable arachidonate metabolites (PGD(2), PGE(2), and PGF(2)) by the action of three groups of enzymes. Prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS) was first purified from bovine lung and catalyzes the formation of 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF(2) from PGD(2) and PGF(2)(alpha) from PGH(2) in the presence of NADPH. Human PGFS is 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD) type II and has PGFS activity and 3 alpha-HSD activity. Human lung PGFS has been crystallized with the cofactor NADP(+) and the substrate PGD(2), and with the cofactor NADPH and the inhibitor rutin. These complex structures have been determined at 1.69 A resolution. PGFS has an (alpha/beta)(8) barrel structure. The cofactor and substrate or inhibitor bind in a cavity at the C-terminal end of the barrel. The cofactor binds deeply in the cavity and has extensive interactions with PGFS through hydrogen bonds, whereas the substrate (PGD(2)) is located above the bound cofactor and has little interaction with PGFS. Despite being largely structurally different from PGD(2), rutin is located at the same site of PGD(2), and its catechol and rhamnose moieties are involved in hydrogen bonds with PGFS. The catalytic site of PGFS contains the conserved Y55 and H117 residues. The carbonyl O(11) of PGD(2) and the hydroxyl O(13) of rutin are involved in hydrogen bonds with Y55 and H117. The cyclopentane ring of PGD(2) and the phenyl ring of rutin face the re-side of the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor. On the basis of the catalytic geometry, a direct hydride transfer from NADPH to PGD(2) would be a reasonable catalytic mechanism. The hydride transfer is facilitated by protonation of carbonyl O(11) of PGD(2) from either H117 (at low pH) or Y55 (at high pH). Since the substrate binding cavity of PGFS is relatively large in comparison with those of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, PGFS (AKR1C3) could catalyze the reduction and/or oxidation reactions of various compounds over a relatively wide pH range.</p>

<p>The hydrophobic effect, the free-energetically favorable association of nonpolar solutes in water, makes a dominant contribution to binding of many systems of ligands and proteins. The objective of this study was to examine the hydrophobic effect in biomolecular recognition using two chemically different but structurally similar hydrophobic groups, aliphatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic fluorocarbons, and to determine whether the hydrophobicity of the two groups could be distinguished by thermodynamic and biostructural analysis. This paper uses isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to examine the thermodynamics of binding of benzenesulfonamides substituted in the para position with alkyl and fluoroalkyl chains (H(2)NSO(2)C(6)H(4)-CONHCH(2)(CX(2))(n)CX(3), n = 0-4, X = H, F) to human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II). Both alkyl and fluoroalkyl substituents contribute favorably to the enthalpy and the entropy of binding; these contributions increase as the length of chain of the hydrophobic substituent increases. Crystallography of the protein-ligand complexes indicates that the benzenesulfonamide groups of all ligands examined bind with similar geometry, that the tail groups associate with the hydrophobic wall of HCA II (which is made up of the side chains of residues Phe131, Val135, Pro202, and Leu204), and that the structure of the protein is indistinguishable for all but one of the complexes (the longest member of the fluoroalkyl series). Analysis of the thermodynamics of binding as a function of structure is compatible with the hypothesis that hydrophobic binding of both alkyl and fluoroalkyl chains to hydrophobic surface of carbonic anhydrase is due primarily to the release of nonoptimally hydrogen-bonded water molecules that hydrate the binding cavity (including the hydrophobic wall) of HCA II and to the release of water molecules that surround the hydrophobic chain of the ligands. This study defines the balance of enthalpic and entropic contributions to the hydrophobic effect in this representative system of protein and ligand: hydrophobic interactions, here, seem to comprise approximately equal contributions from enthalpy (plausibly from strengthening networks of hydrogen bonds among molecules of water) and entropy (from release of water from configurationally restricted positions).</p>

<p>Copper amine oxidases (CAOs) catalyze the oxidative deamination of primary amines to their corresponding aldehydes, with the concomitant reduction of O(2) to H(2)O(2). Catalysis requires two cofactors: a mononuclear copper center and the cofactor 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ). TPQ is synthesized through the post-translational modification of an endogenous tyrosine residue and requires only oxygen and copper to proceed. TPQ biogenesis in CAO can be supported by alternate metals, albeit at decreased rates. A variety of factors are thought to contribute to the degree to which a metal can support TPQ biogenesis, including Lewis acidity, redox potential and electrostatic stabilization capability. The crystal structure has been solved of one of two characterized CAOs from the yeast Hansenula polymorpha (HPAO-1) in its metal-free (apo) form, which contains an unmodified precursor tyrosine residue instead of fully processed TPQ (HPAO-1 was denoted HPAO in the literature prior to 2010). Structures of apoHPAO-1 in complex with Cu(I) and Co(II) have also been solved, providing structural insight into metal binding prior to biogenesis.</p>

<p>The human ABO(H) A and B blood group glycosyltransferases GTA and GTB differ by only four amino acids, yet this small dissimilarity is responsible for significant differences in biosynthesis, kinetics and structure. Like other glycosyltransferases, these two enzymes have been shown to recognize substrates through dramatic conformational changes in mobile polypeptide loops surrounding the active site. Structures of GTA, GTB and several chimeras determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction demonstrate a range of susceptibility to the choice of cryoprotectant, in which the mobile polypeptide loops can be induced by glycerol to form the ordered closed conformation associated with substrate recognition and by MPD [hexylene glycol, (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol] to hinder binding of substrate in the active site owing to chelation of the Mn²⁺ cofactor and thereby adopt the disordered open state. Glycerol is often avoided as a cryoprotectant when determining the structures of carbohydrate-active enzymes as it may act as a competitive inhibitor for monosaccharide ligands. Here, it is shown that the use of glycerol as a cryoprotectant can additionally induce significant changes in secondary structure, a phenomenon that could apply to any class of protein.</p>

<p>Design, synthesis, and SAR of 7-oxopyrrolopyridine-derived DPP4 inhibitors are described. The preferred stereochemistry of these atropisomeric biaryl analogs has been identified as Sa. Compound (+)-3t, with a K(i) against DPP4, DPP8, and DPP9 of 0.37 nM, 2.2, and 5.7 μM, respectively, showed a significant improvement in insulin response after single doses of 3 and 10 μmol/kg in ob/ob mice.</p>

<p>D-Xylose isomerase (XI) and triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) catalyze the aldose-ketose isomerization reactions of D-xylose and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (DGAP), respectively. D-Glyceraldehyde (DGA) is the triose fragment common to the substrates for XI and TIM. The XI-catalyzed isomerization of DGA to give dihydroxyacetone (DHA) in D(2)O was monitored by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and a k(cat)/K(m) of 0.034 M(-1) s(-1) was determined for this isomerization at pD 7.0. This is similar to the k(cat)/K(m) of 0.017 M(-1) s(-1) for the TIM-catalyzed carbon deprotonation reaction of DGA in D(2)O at pD 7.0 [Amyes, T. L., O'Donoghue, A. C., and Richard, J. P. (2001) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123, 11325-11326]. The much larger activation barrier for XI-catalyzed isomerization of D-xylose (k(cat)/K(m) = 490 M(-1) s(-1)) versus that for the TIM-catalyzed isomerization of DGAP (k(cat)/K(m) = 9.6 × 10(6) M(-1) s(-1)) is due to (i) the barrier to conversion of cyclic d-xylose to the reactive linear sugar (5.4 kcal/mol) being larger than that for conversion of DGAP hydrate to the free aldehyde (1.7 kcal/mol) and (ii) the intrinsic binding energy [Jencks, W. P. (1975) Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 43, 219-410] of the terminal ethylene glycol fragment of D-xylose (9.3 kcal/mol) being smaller than that of the phosphodianion group of DGAP (~12 kcal/mol). The XI-catalyzed isomerization of DGA in D(2)O at pD 7.0 gives a 90% yield of [1-(1)H]DHA and a 10% yield of [1-(2)H]DHA, the product of isomerization with incorporation of deuterium from solvent D(2)O. By comparison, the transfer of (3)H from the labeled hexose substrate to solvent is observed only once in every 10(9) turnovers for the XI-catalyzed isomerization of [2-(3)H]glucose in H(2)O [Allen, K. N., Lavie, A., Farber, G. K., Glasfeld, A., Petsko, G. A., and Ringe, D. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 1481-1487]. We propose that truncation of the terminal ethylene glycol fragment of d-xylose to give DGA results in a large decrease in the rate of XI-catalyzed isomerization with hydride transfer compared with that for proton transfer. An ultra-high-resolution (0.97 Å) X-ray crystal structure was determined for the complex obtained by soaking crystals of XI with 50 mM DGA. The triose binds to XI as the unreactive hydrate, but ligand binding induces metal cofactor movement and conformational changes in active site residues similar to those observed for XI·sugar complexes.</p>

<p>The β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases form a large family of ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze oxidation of various β-hydroxy acid substrates to corresponding semialdehydes. Several known enzymes include β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, 2-(hydroxymethyl)glutarate dehydrogenase, and phenylserine dehydrogenase, but the vast majority of β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases remain uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that the predicted β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase PA0743 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa catalyzes an NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of l-serine and methyl-l-serine but exhibits low activity against β-hydroxyisobutyrate. Two crystal structures of PA0743 were solved at 2.2-2.3-Å resolution and revealed an N-terminal Rossmann fold domain connected by a long α-helix to the C-terminal all-α domain. The PA0743 apostructure showed the presence of additional density modeled as HEPES bound in the interdomain cleft close to the predicted catalytic Lys-171, revealing the molecular details of the PA0743 substrate-binding site. The structure of the PA0743-NAD(+) complex demonstrated that the opposite side of the enzyme active site accommodates the cofactor, which is also bound near Lys-171. Site-directed mutagenesis of PA0743 emphasized the critical role of four amino acid residues in catalysis including the primary catalytic residue Lys-171. Our results provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and activity of β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases.</p>

<p>Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well validated target in cancer chemotherapy. Here, a new crystal form of the R163K variant of human TS (hTS) with five subunits per asymmetric part of the unit cell, all with loop 181-197 in the active conformation, is reported. This form allows binding studies by soaking crystals in artificial mother liquors containing ligands that bind in the active site. Using this approach, crystal structures of hTS complexes with FdUMP and dUMP were obtained, indicating that this form should facilitate high-throughput analysis of hTS complexes with drug candidates. Crystal soaking experiments using oxidized glutathione revealed that hTS binds this ligand. Interestingly, the two types of binding observed are both asymmetric. In one subunit of the physiological dimer covalent modification of the catalytic nucleophile Cys195 takes place, while in another dimer a noncovalent adduct with reduced glutathione is formed in one of the active sites.</p>

<p>In order to identify a rice gibberellin ester β-D-glucosidase, gibberellin A4 β-D-glucosyl ester (GA4-GE) was synthesized and used to screen rice β-glucosidases. Os3BGlu6 was found to have the highest hydrolysis activity to GA4-GE among five recombinantly expressed rice glycoside hydrolase family GH1 enzymes from different phylogenic clusters. The kinetic parameters of Os3BGlu6 and its mutants E178Q, E178A, E394D, E394Q and M251N for hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPGlc) and GA4-GE confirmed the roles of the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile for hydrolysis of both substrates and suggested M251 contributes to binding hydrophobic aglycones. The activities of the Os3BGlu6 E178Q and E178A acid/base mutants were rescued by azide, which they transglucosylate to produce β-D-glucopyranosyl azide, in a pH-dependent manner, while acetate also rescued Os3BGlu6 E178A at low pH. High concentrations of sodium azide (200-400 mM) inhibited Os3BGlu6 E178Q but not Os3BGlu6 E178A. The structures of Os3BGlu6 E178Q crystallized with either GA4-GE or pNPGlc had a native α-D-glucosyl moiety covalently linked to the catalytic nucleophile, E394, which showed the hydrogen bonding to the 2-hydroxyl in the covalent intermediate. These data suggest that a GH1 β-glucosidase uses the same retaining catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze 1-O-acyl glucose ester and glucoside.</p>

<p>Purine nucleoside phosphorylases catalyze the phosphorolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond of purine (2'-deoxy)nucleosides, generating the corresponding free base and (2'-deoxy)-ribose 1-phosphate. Two classes of PNPs have been identified: homotrimers specific for 6-oxopurines and homohexamers that accept both 6-oxopurines and 6-aminopurines. Bacillus cereus adenosine phosphorylase (AdoP) is a hexameric PNP; however, it is highly specific for 6-aminopurines. To investigate the structural basis for the unique substrate specificity of AdoP, the active-site mutant D204N was prepared and kinetically characterized and the structures of the wild-type protein and the D204N mutant complexed with adenosine and sulfate or with inosine and sulfate were determined at high resolution (1.2-1.4 Å). AdoP interacts directly with the preferred substrate through a hydrogen-bond donation from the catalytically important residue Asp204 to N7 of the purine base. Comparison with Escherichia coli PNP revealed a more optimal orientation of Asp204 towards N7 of adenosine and a more closed active site. When inosine is bound, two water molecules are interposed between Asp204 and the N7 and O6 atoms of the nucleoside, thus allowing the enzyme to find alternative but less efficient ways to stabilize the transition state. The mutation of Asp204 to asparagine led to a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency for adenosine without affecting the efficiency of inosine cleavage.</p>

<p>Structures of human cytochrome P450 2B6 and rabbit cytochrome P450 2B4 in complex with two molecules of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The presence of two drug molecules suggests clear substrate access channels in each P450. According to a previously established nomenclature, amlodipine molecules were trapped in access pathway 2f in P450 2B6 and in pathway 2a or 2f in P450 2B4. These pathways overlap for part of the length and then diverge as they extend toward the protein surface. A previously described solvent channel was also found in each enzyme. The results indicate that key residues located on the surface and at the entrance of the substrate access channels in each of these P450s may play a crucial role in guiding substrate entry. In addition, the region of P450 2B6 and 2B4 involving helices B', F, F', and G' and part of helix G is substantially more open in the amlodipine complexes than in the corresponding 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole complexes. The increased active site volume observed results from the major retraction of helices F, F', and B' and the β4 sheet region located close to the binding cavity to accommodate amlodipine. These structures demonstrate novel insight into distinct conformational states not observed with previous P450 2B structures and provide clear evidence of the substrate access channels in two drug-metabolizing P450s. In addition, the structures exhibit the versatility that can be exploited via in silico studies with other P450 2B6 ligands as large as raloxifene and itraconazole.</p>

<p>Purine nucleoside phosphorylases catalyze the phosphorolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond of purine (2'-deoxy)nucleosides, generating the corresponding free base and (2'-deoxy)-ribose 1-phosphate. Two classes of PNPs have been identified: homotrimers specific for 6-oxopurines and homohexamers that accept both 6-oxopurines and 6-aminopurines. Bacillus cereus adenosine phosphorylase (AdoP) is a hexameric PNP; however, it is highly specific for 6-aminopurines. To investigate the structural basis for the unique substrate specificity of AdoP, the active-site mutant D204N was prepared and kinetically characterized and the structures of the wild-type protein and the D204N mutant complexed with adenosine and sulfate or with inosine and sulfate were determined at high resolution (1.2-1.4 Å). AdoP interacts directly with the preferred substrate through a hydrogen-bond donation from the catalytically important residue Asp204 to N7 of the purine base. Comparison with Escherichia coli PNP revealed a more optimal orientation of Asp204 towards N7 of adenosine and a more closed active site. When inosine is bound, two water molecules are interposed between Asp204 and the N7 and O6 atoms of the nucleoside, thus allowing the enzyme to find alternative but less efficient ways to stabilize the transition state. The mutation of Asp204 to asparagine led to a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency for adenosine without affecting the efficiency of inosine cleavage.</p>

<p>ADP-dependent kinases are used in the modified Embden-Meyerhoff pathway of certain archaea. Our previous study has revealed a mechanism for ADP-dependent phosphoryl transfer by Thermococcus litoralis glucokinase (tlGK), and its evolutionary relationship with ATP-dependent ribokinases and adenosine kinases (PFKB carbohydrate kinase family members). Here, we report the crystal structure of glucokinase from Pyrococcus furiosus (pfGK) in a closed conformation complexed with glucose and AMP at 1.9A resolution. In comparison with the tlGK structure, the pfGK structure shows significant conformational changes in the small domain and a region around the hinge, suggesting glucose-induced domain closing. A part of the large domain next to the hinge is also shifted accompanied with domain closing. In the pfGK structure, glucose binds in a groove between the large and small domains, and the electron density of O1 atoms for both the alpha and beta-anomer configurations was observed. The structural details of the sugar-binding site of ADP-dependent glucokinase were firstly clarified and then site-directed mutagenesis analysis clarified the catalytic residues for ADP-dependent kinase, such as Arg205 and Asp451 of tlGK. Homology search and multiple alignment of amino acid sequences using the information obtained from the structures reveals that eucaryotic hypothetical proteins homologous to ADP-dependent kinases retain the residues for the recognition of a glucose substrate.</p>

<p>Heparin is a polysaccharide-based natural product that is used clinically as an anticoagulant drug. Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST) is an enzyme that transfers a sulfo group to the 3-OH position of a glucosamine unit. 3-OST is present in multiple isoforms, and the polysaccharides modified by these different isoforms perform distinct biological functions. 3-OST isoform 1 (3-OST-1) is the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of anticoagulant heparin. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of 3-OST-1, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate, and a heptasaccharide substrate. Comparisons to previously determined structures of 3-OST-3 reveal unique binding modes used by the different isoforms of 3-OST for distinguishing the fine structures of saccharide substrates. Our data demonstrate that the saccharide substrates display distinct conformations when interacting with the different 3-OST isoforms. Site-directed mutagenesis data suggest that several key amino residues, including Lys259, Thr256, and Trp283 in 3-OST-3 and Arg268 in 3-OST-1, play important roles in substrate binding and specificity between isoforms. These results deepen our understanding of the biosynthetic mechanism of heparan sulfate and provide structural information for engineering enzymes for an enhanced biosynthetic approach to heparin production.</p>

<p>The crystal structures of two human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) ternary complexes, each with bound NADPH cofactor and a lipophilic antifolate inhibitor, have been determined at atomic resolution. The potent inhibitors 6-([5-quinolylamino]methyl)-2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (SRI-9439) and (Z)-6-(2-[2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethen-1-yl)-2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (SRI-9662) were developed at Southern Research Institute against Toxoplasma gondii DHFR-thymidylate synthase. The 5-deazapteridine ring of each inhibitor adopts an unusual puckered conformation that enables the formation of identical contacts in the active site. Conversely, the quinoline and dimethoxybenzene moieties exhibit distinct binding characteristics that account for the differences in inhibitory activity. In both structures, a salt-bridge is formed between Arg70 in the active site and Glu44 from a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal lattice that mimics the binding of methotrexate to DHFR.</p>

<p>The diuretic drug ethacrynic acid (EA), both an inhibitor and substrate of pi class glutathione S-transferase (GST P1-1), has been tested in clinical trials as an adjuvant in chemotherapy. We recently studied the role of the active site residue Tyr-108 in binding EA to the enzyme and found that the analysis was complicated by covalent binding of this drug to the highly reactive Cys-47. Previous attempts to eliminate this binding by chemical modification yielded ambiguous results and therefore we decided here to produce a double mutant C47S/Y108V by site directed mutagenesis and further expression in Escherichia coli and the interaction of EA and its GSH conjugate (EASG) examined by calorimetric studies and X-ray diffraction. Surprisingly, in the absence of Cys-47, Cys-101 (located at the dimer interface) becomes a target for modification by EA, albeit at a lower conjugation rate than Cys-47. The Cys-47 → Ser mutation in the double mutant enzyme induces a positive cooperativity between the two subunits when ligands with affinity to G-site bind to enzyme. However, this mutation does not seem to affect the thermodynamic properties of ligand binding to the electrophilic binding site (H-site) and the thermal or chemical stability of this double mutant does not significantly affect the unfolding mechanism in either the absence or presence of ligand. Crystal structures of apo and an EASG complex are essentially identical with a few exceptions in the H-site and in the water network at the dimer interface.</p>

<p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cytochrome P450 gene CYP121 is shown to be essential for viability of the bacterium in vitro by gene knock-out with complementation. Production of CYP121 protein in Mtb cells is demonstrated. Minimum inhibitory concentration values for azole drugs against Mtb H37Rv were determined, the rank order of which correlated well with Kd values for their binding to CYP121. Solution-state spectroscopic, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies and crystal structure determination for a series of CYP121 active site mutants provide further insights into structure and biophysical features of the enzyme. Pro346 was shown to control heme cofactor conformation, whereas Arg386 is a critical determinant of heme potential, with an unprecedented 280-mV increase in heme iron redox potential in a R386L mutant. A homologous Mtb redox partner system was reconstituted and transported electrons faster to CYP121 R386L than to wild type CYP121. Heme potential was not perturbed in a F338H mutant, suggesting that a proposed P450 superfamily-wide role for the phylogenetically conserved phenylalanine in heme thermodynamic regulation is unlikely. Collectively, data point to an important cellular role for CYP121 and highlight its potential as a novel Mtb drug target.</p>

<p>Leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase (L/F-transferase) is an N-end rule pathway enzyme, which catalyzes the transfer of Leu and Phe from aminoacyl-tRNAs to exposed N-terminal Arg or Lys residues of acceptor proteins. Here, we report the 1.6 A resolution crystal structure of L/F-transferase (JW0868) from Escherichia coli, the first three-dimensional structure of an L/F-transferase. The L/F-transferase adopts a monomeric structure consisting of two domains that form a bilobate molecule. The N-terminal domain forms a small lobe with a novel fold. The large C-terminal domain has a highly conserved fold, which is observed in the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family. Most of the conserved residues of L/F-transferase reside in the central cavity, which exists at the interface between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. A comparison of the structures of L/F-transferase and the bacterial peptidoglycan synthase FemX, indicated a structural homology in the C-terminal domain, and a similar domain interface region. Although the peptidyltransferase function is shared between the two proteins, the enzymatic mechanism would differ. The conserved residues in the central cavity of L/F-transferase suggest that this region is important for the enzyme catalysis.</p>

<p>Glycogen/starch synthase elongates glucan chains and is the key enzyme in the synthesis of glycogen in bacteria and starch in plants. Cocrystallization of Escherichia coli wild-type glycogen synthase (GS) with substrate ADPGlc and the glucan acceptor mimic HEPPSO produced a closed form of GS and suggests that domain-domain closure accompanies glycogen synthesis. Cocrystallization of the inactive GS mutant E377A with substrate ADPGlc and oligosaccharide results in the first oligosaccharide-bound glycogen synthase structure. Four bound oligosaccharides are observed, one in the interdomain cleft (G6a) and three on the N-terminal domain surface (G6b, G6c, and G6d). Extending from the center of the enzyme to the interdomain cleft opening, G6a mostly interacts with the highly conserved N-terminal domain residues lining the cleft of GS. The surface-bound oligosaccharides G6c and G6d have less interaction with enzyme and exhibit a more curled, helixlike structural arrangement. The observation that oligosaccharides bind only to the N-terminal domain of GS suggests that glycogen in vivo probably binds to only one side of the enzyme to ensure unencumbered interdomain movement, which is required for efficient, continuous glucan-chain synthesis.</p>

<p>The 1.8 A resolution de novo structure of nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.6) from Trypanosoma brucei (TbNDRT) has been determined by SADa phasing in an unliganded state and several ligand-bound states. This enzyme is important in the salvage pathway of nucleoside recycling. To identify novel lead compounds, we exploited "fragment cocktail soaks". Out of 304 compounds tried in 31 cocktails, four compounds could be identified crystallographically in the active site. In addition, we demonstrated that very short soaks of approximately 10 s are sufficient even for rather hydrophobic ligands to bind in the active site groove, which is promising for the application of similar soaking experiments to less robust crystals of other proteins.</p>

<p>High-throughput screening of the P&amp;GP corporate repository against several protein tyrosine phosphatases identified the sulfamic acid moiety as potential phosphotyrosine mimetic. Incorporation of the sulfamic acid onto a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffold provided a promising starting point for PTP1B inhibitor design.</p>

<p>Despite the success of genomics in identifying new essential bacterial genes, there is a lack of sustainable leads in antibacterial drug discovery to address increasing multidrug resistance. Type IIA topoisomerases cleave and religate DNA to regulate DNA topology and are a major class of antibacterial and anticancer drug targets, yet there is no well developed structural basis for understanding drug action. Here we report the 2.1 A crystal structure of a potent, new class, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent in complex with Staphylococcus aureus DNA gyrase and DNA, showing a new mode of inhibition that circumvents fluoroquinolone resistance in this clinically important drug target. The inhibitor 'bridges' the DNA and a transient non-catalytic pocket on the two-fold axis at the GyrA dimer interface, and is close to the active sites and fluoroquinolone binding sites. In the inhibitor complex the active site seems poised to cleave the DNA, with a single metal ion observed between the TOPRIM (topoisomerase/primase) domain and the scissile phosphate. This work provides new insights into the mechanism of topoisomerase action and a platform for structure-based drug design of a new class of antibacterial agents against a clinically proven, but conformationally flexible, enzyme class.</p>

<p>Phosphotransacetylase (Pta) [EC 2.3.1.8] plays a major role in acetate metabolism by catalyzing the reversible transfer of the acetyl group between coenzyme A (CoA) and orthophosphate: CH(3)COSCoA+HPO(4)(2-)&lt;--&gt;CH(3)COOPO(3)(2-) +CoASH. In this study, we report the crystal structures of Pta from Bacillus subtilis at 2.75 A resolution and its complex with acetyl phosphate, one of its substrates, at 2.85 A resolution. In addition, the Pta activity of the enzyme has been assayed. The enzyme folds into an alpha/beta architecture with two domains separated by a prominent cleft, very similar to two other known Pta structures. The enzyme-acetyl phosphate complex structure reveals a few potential substrate binding sites. Two of them are located in the middle of the interdomain cleft: each one is surrounded by a region of strictly and highly conserved residues. High structural similarities are found with 4-hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (PdxA), and isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases, all of which utilize NADP+ as their cofactor, which binds in the interdomain cleft. Their substrate binding sites are close to the acetyl phosphate binding sites of Pta in the cleft as well. These results suggest that the CoA is likely to bind to the interdomain cleft of Pta in a similar way as NADP+ binds to the other three enzymes.</p>

<p>Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5'-monophosphates and participates in the regulation of purine nucleotide pools within the cell. It interferes with the phosphorylation-dependent activation of nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of cancer and viral diseases. It is allosterically activated by a number of phosphate-containing cellular metabolites such as ATP, diadenosine polyphosphates, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which couple its activity with the metabolic state of the cell. We present seven high-resolution structures of human cN-II, including a ligand-free form and complexes with various substrates and effectors. These structures reveal the structural basis for the allosteric activation of cN-II, uncovering a mechanism where an effector-induced disorder-to-order transition generates rearrangements within the catalytic site and the subsequent coordination of the catalytically essential magnesium. Central to the activation is the large transition of the catalytically essential Asp356. This study also provides the structural basis for the substrate specificity of cN-II, where Arg202, Asp206, and Phe157 seem to be important residues for purine/pyrimidine selectivity. These structures provide a comprehensive structural basis for the design of cN-II inhibitors. They also contribute to the understanding of how the nucleotide salvage pathway is regulated at a molecular level.</p>

<p>The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulphate, an area currently generating great interest in microbiology, is accomplished by consortia of methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulphate-reducing bacteria. The enzyme activating methane in methanotrophic archaea has tentatively been identified as a homologue of methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) that catalyses the methane-forming step in methanogenic archaea. Here we report an X-ray structure of the 280 kDa heterohexameric ANME-1 MCR complex. It was crystallized uniquely from a protein ensemble purified from consortia of microorganisms collected with a submersible from a Black Sea mat catalysing AOM with sulphate. Crystals grown from the heterogeneous sample diffract to 2.1 Å resolution and consist of a single ANME-1 MCR population, demonstrating the strong selective power of crystallization. The structure revealed ANME-1 MCR in complex with coenzyme M and coenzyme B, indicating the same substrates for MCR from methanotrophic and methanogenic archaea. Differences between the highly similar structures of ANME-1 MCR and methanogenic MCR include a F(430) modification, a cysteine-rich patch and an altered post-translational amino acid modification pattern, which may tune the enzymes for their functions in different biological contexts.</p>

<p>Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors such as trimethoprim (TMP) have long played a significant role in the treatment of bacterial infections. Not surprisingly, after decades of use there is now bacterial resistance to TMP and therefore a need to develop novel antibacterial agents with expanded spectrum including these resistant strains. In this study, we investigated the optimization of 2,4-diamnoquinazolines for antibacterial potency and selectivity. Using structure-based drug design, several 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazolines were discovered that have excellent sub-100 picomolar potency against bacterial DHFR. These compounds have good antibacterial activity especially on gram-positive pathogens including TMP-resistant strains.</p>

<p>The quorum sensor and signalling molecule pyocyanin (PYO) contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Comparison to phenothiazine drugs suggests that the antimalarial compound methylene blue (MB) can be regarded as a sulfur analog of PYO. This working hypothesis would explain why the synthetic drug MB behaves as a compound shaped in biological evolution. Here we report on redox-associated biological and biochemical properties of PYO in direct comparison to its synthetic analog MB. We quantitatively describe the reactivity of both compounds toward cellular reductants, the reactivity of their reduced leuco-forms towards O2, and their interactions with FAD-containing disulfide reductases. Furthermore, the interaction of PYO with human glutathione reductase was studied in structural detail by x-ray crystallography, showing that a single PYO molecule binds to the intersubunit cavity of the enzyme. Like MB, also PYO was also found to be active against blood schizonts of the malaria parasite P. falciparum in vitro. Furthermore, both compounds were active against the disease transmitting gametocyte forms of the parasites, which was systematically studied in vitro. As shown for mice, PYO is too toxic to be used as a drug. It may, however, have antimalarial activity in numerous human patients with concomitant Pseudomonas infections. MB, in contrast to PYO, is well tolerated and represents a promising agent for MB-based combination therapies against malaria. Current and future clinical studies can be guided by the comparisons between MB and PYO reported here. Additionally, it is of interest to study if and to what extent the protection from malaria in patients with cystic fibrosis or with severe wound infections is based on PYO produced by Pseudomonas species.</p>

<p>The accessibility of large substrates to buried enzymatic active sites is dependent upon the utilization of proteinaceous channels. The necessity of these channels in the case of small substrates is questionable because diffusion through the protein matrix is often assumed. Copper amine oxidases contain a buried protein-derived quinone cofactor and a mononuclear copper center that catalyze the conversion of two substrates, primary amines and molecular oxygen, to aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The nature of molecular oxygen migration to the active site in the enzyme from Hansenula polymorpha is explored using a combination of kinetic, x-ray crystallographic, and computational approaches. A crystal structure of H. polymorpha amine oxidase in complex with xenon gas, which serves as an experimental probe for molecular oxygen binding sites, reveals buried regions of the enzyme suitable for transient molecular oxygen occupation. Calculated O(2) free energy maps using copper amine oxidase crystal structures in the absence of xenon correspond well with later experimentally observed xenon sites in these systems, and allow the visualization of O(2) migration routes of differing probabilities within the protein matrix. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to block individual routes has little effect on overall k(cat)/K(m) (O(2)), supporting multiple dynamic pathways for molecular oxygen to reach the active site.</p>

<p>Sortases anchor surface proteins to the cell wall of Gram-positive pathogens through recognition of specific motif sequences. Loss of sortase leads to large reductions in virulence, which identifies sortase as a target for the development of antibacterials. By screening 135,625 small molecules for inhibition, we report here that aryl (beta-amino)ethyl ketones inhibit sortase enzymes from staphylococci and bacilli. Inhibition of sortases occurs through an irreversible, covalent modification of their active site cysteine. Sortases specifically activate this class of molecules via beta-elimination, generating a reactive olefin intermediate that covalently modifies the cysteine thiol. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of Bacillus anthracis sortase B with and without inhibitor provides insights into the mechanism of inhibition and reveals binding pockets that can be exploited for drug discovery.</p>

<p>The activity of class D β-lactamases is dependent on Lys70 carboxylation in the active site. Structural, kinetic and affinity studies show that this post-translational modification can be affected by the presence of a poor substrate such as moxalactam but also by the V117T substitution. Val117 is a strictly conserved hydrophobic residue located in the active site. In addition, inhibition of class D β-lactamases by chloride ions is due to a competition between the side chain carboxylate of the modified Lys70 and chloride ions. Determination of the individual kinetic constants shows that the deacylation of the acyl-enzyme is the rate-limiting step for the wild-type OXA-10 β-lactamase.</p>

<p>Organophosphate compounds (OP) are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) and can cause lethal poisoning in humans. Inhibition of AChEs by the OP soman involves phosphonylation of the catalytic serine, and subsequent dealkylation produces a form known as the "aged" enzyme. The nonaged form can be reactivated to a certain extent by nucleophiles, such as pralidoxime (2-PAM), whereas aged forms of OP-inhibited AChEs are totally resistant to reactivation. Here, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of AChE from Torpedo californica (TcAChE) conjugated with soman before and after aging. The absolute configuration of the soman stereoisomer adduct in the nonaged conjugate is P(S)C(R). A structural reorientation of the catalytic His440 side chain was observed during the aging process. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the ternary complex of the aged conjugate with 2-PAM revealed that the orientation of the oxime function does not permit nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom, thus providing a plausible explanation for its failure to reactivate the aged soman/AChE conjugate. Together, these three crystal structures provide an experimental basis for the design of new reactivators.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress is a widespread challenge for living organisms, and especially so for parasitic ones, given the fact that their hosts can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a mechanism of defense. Thus, long lived parasites, such as the flatworm Schistosomes, have evolved refined enzymatic systems capable of detoxifying ROS. Among these, glutathione peroxidases (Gpx) are a family of sulfur or selenium-dependent isozymes sharing the ability to reduce peroxides using the reducing equivalents provided by glutathione or possibly small proteins such as thioredoxin. As for other frontline antioxidant enzymatic systems, Gpxs are localized in the tegument of the Schistosomes, the outermost defense layer. In this article, we present the first crystal structure at 1.0 and 1.7 A resolution of two recombinant SmGpxs, carrying the active site mutations Sec43Cys and Sec43Ser, respectively. The structures confirm that this enzyme belongs to the monomeric class 4 (phospholipid hydroperoxide) Gpx. In the case of the Sec to Cys mutant, the catalytic Cys residue is oxidized to sulfonic acid. By combining static crystallography with molecular dynamics simulations, we obtained insight into the substrate binding sites and the conformational changes relevant to catalysis, proposing a role for the unusual reactivity of the catalytic residue.</p>

<p>Mycobacteria have a unique cell wall consisting of mycolic acids, very-long-chain lipids that provide protection and allow the bacteria to persist within human macrophages. Inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis is fatal for the organism and a starting point for the discovery and development of novel antibiotics. We determined the crystal structures of KasA, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids, in its apo-form and bound to the natural product inhibitor thiolactomycin. Detailed insights into the interaction of the inhibitor with KasA and the identification of a polyethylene glycol molecule that mimics a fatty acid substrate of approximately 40 carbon atoms length, represent the first atomic view of a mycobacterial enzyme involved in the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and provide a robust platform for the development of novel thiolactomycin analogs with high affinity for KasA.</p>

The absolute configuration of the soman stereoisomer adduct in the nonaged conjugate is P(S)C(R). A structural reorientation of the catalytic His440 side chain was observed during the aging process. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the ternary complex of the aged conjugate with 2-PAM revealed that the orientation of the oxime function does not permit nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom, thus providing a plausible explanation for its failure to reactivate the aged soman/AChE conjugate. Together, these three crystal structures provide an experimental basis for the design of new reactivators.</p>

<p>Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well validated target in cancer chemotherapy. Here, a new crystal form of the R163K variant of human TS (hTS) with five subunits per asymmetric part of the unit cell, all with loop 181-197 in the active conformation, is reported. This form allows binding studies by soaking crystals in artificial mother liquors containing ligands that bind in the active site. Using this approach, crystal structures of hTS complexes with FdUMP and dUMP were obtained, indicating that this form should facilitate high-throughput analysis of hTS complexes with drug candidates. Crystal soaking experiments using oxidized glutathione revealed that hTS binds this ligand. Interestingly, the two types of binding observed are both asymmetric. In one subunit of the physiological dimer covalent modification of the catalytic nucleophile Cys195 takes place, while in another dimer a noncovalent adduct with reduced glutathione is formed in one of the active sites.</p>

<p>The carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a family of mostly zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate and a proton. Recently, there has been industrial interest in utilizing CAs as biocatalysts for carbon sequestration and biofuel production. The conditions used in these processes, however, result in high temperatures and acidic pH. This unfavorable environment results in rapid destabilization and loss of catalytic activity in CAs, ultimately resulting in cost-inefficient high-maintenance operation of the system. In order to negate these detrimental industrial conditions, cysteines at residues 23 (Ala23Cys) and 203 (Leu203Cys) were engineered into a wild-type variant of human CA II (HCAII) containing the mutation Cys206Ser. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the disulfide-containing HCAII (dsHCAII) was solved to 1.77 Å resolution and revealed that successful oxidation of the cysteine bond was achieved while also retaining desirable active-site geometry. Kinetic studies utilizing the measurement of (18)O-labeled CO2 by mass spectrometry revealed that dsHCAII retained high catalytic efficiency, and differential scanning calorimetry showed acid stability and thermal stability that was enhanced by up to 14 K compared with native HCAII. Together, these studies have shown that dsHCAII has properties that could be used in an industrial setting to help to lower costs and improve the overall reaction efficiency. </p>

<p>The flagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the pathogenic agent of Chagas disease (also called American trypanosomiasis), which causes approximately 50,000 deaths annually. The disease is endemic in South and Central America. The parasite is usually transmitted by a blood-feeding insect vector, but can also be transmitted via blood transfusion. In the chronic form, Chagas disease causes severe damage to the heart and other organs. There is no satisfactory treatment for chronic Chagas disease and no vaccine is available. There is an urgent need for the development of chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of T. cruzi infection and therefore for the identification of potential drug targets. The dihydrofolate reductase activity of T. cruzi, which is expressed as part of a bifunctional enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS), is a potential target for drug development. In order to gain a detailed understanding of the structure-function relationship of T. cruzi DHFR, the three-dimensional structure of this protein in complex with various ligands is being studied. Here, the crystal structures of T. cruzi DHFR-TS with three different compositions of the DHFR domain are reported: the folate-free state, the complex with the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate (TMQ) and the complex with the classical antifolate methotrexate (MTX). These structures reveal that the enzyme is a homodimer with substantial interactions between the two TS domains of neighboring subunits. In contrast to the enzymes from Cryptosporidium hominis and Plasmodium falciparum, the DHFR and TS active sites of T. cruzi lie on the same side of the monomer. As in other parasitic DHFR-TS proteins, the N-terminal extension of the T. cruzi enzyme is involved in extensive interactions between the two domains. The DHFR active site of the T. cruzi enzyme shows subtle differences compared with its human counterpart. These differences may be exploited for the development of antifolate-based therapeutic agents for the treatment of T. cruzi infection.</p>

<p>Oestradiol is a well-characterized sex hormone that stimulates breast cancer and other oestrogen-related diseases. 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-HSD1) catalyses the last step in the synthesis of oestradiol and androstenediol in breast tumour tissue. The enzyme's high expression and activity after simultaneous blockade of oestrogen receptors and inhibition of aromatase in the tumour shows the necessity for its inhibition as a requirement for breast cancer therapy. In the present paper, we report structures of the binary and ternary complexes of 17beta-HSD1 with a new inhibitor E2B {3-[3',17'beta-dihydroxyestra-1',3',5'(10')-trien-16'beta-methyl]benzamide}, and the enzyme inhibition by the later. The IC50 value for E2B was determined to be 42 nM in T47D cells. Multiple interactions between E2B and the enzyme include hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as pi-pi interactions. A kinetic study demonstrated that E2B inhibits the enzyme's reduction forming oestradiol from oestrone, with a Ki of 0.9+/-0.15 nM. Such strong inhibition is in agreement with its extensive interaction with the enzyme, suggesting its potential as a lead compound for breast cancer therapy. In fact, this possibility is enhanced by its capacity for cell penetration similar to natural steroids. Such inhibitors that block oestrogen synthesis to suppress the sulfatase pathway producing oestradiol can be used in adjuvant therapies with oestrogen receptor blockade, opening a new orientation of breast cancer treatment.</p>

<p>We have used chemical protein synthesis and advanced physical methods to probe dynamics-function correlations for the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme that has received considerable attention as a target for the treatment of AIDS. Chemical synthesis was used to prepare a series of unique analogues of the HIV-1 protease in which the flexibility of the "flap" structures (residues 37-61 in each monomer of the homodimeric protein molecule) was systematically varied. These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations. We show that conformational isomerization in the flaps is correlated with structural reorganization of residues in the active site, and that it is preorganization of the active site that is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis.</p>

<p>The structures of F(1)-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria inhibited with the dietary phytopolyphenol, resveratrol, and with the related polyphenols quercetin and piceatannol have been determined at 2.3-, 2.4- and 2.7-A resolution, respectively. The inhibitors bind to a common site in the inside surface of an annulus made from loops in the three alpha- and three beta-subunits beneath the "crown" of beta-strands in their N-terminal domains. This region of F(1)-ATPase forms a bearing to allow the rotation of the tip of the gamma-subunit inside the annulus during catalysis. The binding site is a hydrophobic pocket between the C-terminal tip of the gamma-subunit and the beta(TP) subunit, and the inhibitors are bound via H-bonds mostly to their hydroxyl moieties mediated by bound water molecules and by hydrophobic interactions. There are no equivalent sites between the gamma-subunit and either the beta(DP) or the beta(E) subunit. The inhibitors probably prevent both the synthetic and hydrolytic activities of the enzyme by blocking both senses of rotation of the gamma-subunit. The beneficial effects of dietary resveratrol may derive in part by preventing mitochondrial ATP synthesis in tumor cells, thereby inducing apoptosis.</p>

<p>The RIO kinases are essential protein factors required for the synthesis of new ribosomes in eukaryotes. Conserved in archaeal organisms as well, RIO kinases are among the most ancient of protein kinases. Their exact molecular mechanisms are under investigation and progress of this research would be significantly improved with the availability of suitable molecular probes that selectively block RIO kinases. RIO kinases contain a canonical eukaryotic protein kinase fold, but also display several unusual structural features that potentially create opportunity for the design of selective inhibitors. In an attempt to identify structural leads to target the RIO kinases, a series of pyridine caffeic acid benzyl amides (CABA) were tested for their ability to inhibit the autophosphorylation activity of Archeaoglobus fulgidus Rio1 (AfRio1). Screening of a small library of CABA molecules resulted in the identification of four compounds that measurably inhibited AfRio1 activity. Additional biochemical characterization of binding and inhibition activity of these compounds demonstrated an ATP competitive inhibition mode, and allowed identification of the functional groups that result in the highest binding affinity. In addition, docking of the compound to the structure of Rio1 and determination of the X-ray crystal structure of a model compound (WP1086) containing the desired functional groups allowed detailed analysis of the interactions between these compounds and the enzyme. Furthermore, the X-ray crystal structure demonstrated that these compounds stabilize an inactive form of the enzyme. Taken together, these results provide an important step in identification of a scaffold for the design of selective molecular probes to study molecular mechanisms of Rio1 kinases in vitro and in vivo. In addition, it provides a rationale for the future design of potent inhibitors with drug-like properties targeting an inactive form of the enzyme.

<p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large family of zinc-dependent endoproteases that catalyze cleavage of extracellular matrix and nonmatrix proteins. MMPs play a role in tissue remodeling, and their uncontrolled activity is associated with number of diseases, including tumor metastasis. Thus, there is a need to develop methods to monitor MMP activity, and number of probes has been previously described. The key problem many probes encounter is the issue of selectivity, since 23 human MMPs, despite playing different physiological roles, have structurally similar active sites. Here, we introduce the halogen bonding concept into the probe design and show that the probe containing iodine exhibits an unprecedented selectivity for MMP-9. We provide structure-based explanation for the selectivity, confirming that it is due to formation of the halogen bond that supports catalysis, and we highlight the value of exploring halogen bonding in the context of selective probe design. </p>

<p>Rice Os7BGlu26 is a GH1 family glycoside hydrolase with a threefold higher kcat/Km value for 4-nitrophenyl β-D-mannoside (4NPMan) compared with 4-nitrophenyl β-D-glucoside (4NPGlc). To investigate its selectivity for β-D-mannoside and β-D-glucoside substrates, the structures of apo Os7BGlu26 at a resolution of 2.20 Å and of Os7BGlu26 with mannose at a resolution of 2.45 Å were elucidated from isomorphous crystals in space group P212121. The (β/α)8-barrel structure is similar to other GH1 family structures, but with a narrower active-site cleft. The Os7BGlu26 structure with D-mannose corresponds to a product complex, with β-D-mannose in the (1)S5 skew-boat conformation. Docking of the (1)S3, (1)S5, (2)SO and (3)S1 pyranose-ring conformations of 4NPMan and 4NPGlc substrates into the active site of Os7BGlu26 indicated that the lowest energies were in the (1)S5 and (1)S3 skew-boat conformations. Comparison of these docked conformers with other rice GH1 structures revealed differences in the residues interacting with the catalytic acid/base between enzymes with and without β-D-mannosidase activity. The mutation of Tyr134 to Trp in Os7BGlu26 resulted in similar kcat/Km values for 4NPMan and 4NPGlc, while mutation of Tyr134 to Phe resulted in a 37-fold higher kcat/Km for 4NPMan than 4NPGlc. Mutation of Cys182 to Thr decreased both the activity and the selectivity for β-D-mannoside. It was concluded that interactions with the catalytic acid/base play a significant role in glycon selection. </p>

<p>Despite more than five decades of extensive studies of thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) enzymes, there remain many uncertainties as to how these enzymes achieve their rate enhancements. Here, we present a clear picture of catalysis for the simple nonoxidative decarboxylase, oxalyl-coenzyme A (CoA) decarboxylase, based on crystallographic snapshots along the catalytic cycle and kinetic data on active site mutants. First, we provide crystallographic evidence that, upon binding of oxalyl-CoA, the C-terminal 13 residues fold over the substrate, aligning the substrate alpha-carbon for attack by the ThDP-C2 atom. The second structure presented shows a covalent reaction intermediate after decarboxylation, interpreted as being nonplanar. Finally, the structure of a product complex is presented. In accordance with mutagenesis data, no side chains of the enzyme are implied to directly participate in proton transfer except the glutamic acid (Glu-56), which promotes formation of the 1',4'-iminopyrimidine tautomer of ThDP needed for activation.</p>

<p>Molecular docking computationally screens thousands to millions of organic molecules against protein structures, looking for those with complementary fits. Many approximations are made, often resulting in low "hit rates." A strategy to overcome these approximations is to rescore top-ranked docked molecules using a better but slower method. One such is afforded by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) techniques. These more physically realistic methods have improved models for solvation and electrostatic interactions and conformational change compared to most docking programs. To investigate MM-GBSA rescoring, we re-ranked docking hit lists in three small buried sites: a hydrophobic cavity that binds apolar ligands, a slightly polar cavity that binds aryl and hydrogen-bonding ligands, and an anionic cavity that binds cationic ligands. These sites are simple; consequently, incorrect predictions can be attributed to particular errors in the method, and many likely ligands may actually be tested. In retrospective calculations, MM-GBSA techniques with binding-site minimization better distinguished the known ligands for each cavity from the known decoys compared to the docking calculation alone. This encouraged us to test rescoring prospectively on molecules that ranked poorly by docking but that ranked well when rescored by MM-GBSA. A total of 33 molecules highly ranked by MM-GBSA for the three cavities were tested experimentally. Of these, 23 were observed to bind--these are docking false negatives rescued by rescoring. The 10 remaining molecules are true negatives by docking and false positives by MM-GBSA. X-ray crystal structures were determined for 21 of these 23 molecules. In many cases, the geometry prediction by MM-GBSA improved the initial docking pose and more closely resembled the crystallographic result; yet in several cases, the rescored geometry failed to capture large conformational changes in the protein. Intriguingly, rescoring not only rescued docking false positives, but also introduced several new false positives into the top-ranking molecules. We consider the origins of the successes and failures in MM-GBSA rescoring in these model cavity sites and the prospects for rescoring in biologically relevant targets.</p>

<p>DOPA decarboxylase, the dimeric enzyme responsible for the synthesis of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, is involved in severe neurological diseases such as Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and depression. Binding of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor to the apoenzyme is thought to represent a central mechanism for the regulation of its activity. We solved the structure of the human apoenzyme and found it exists in an unexpected open conformation: compared to the pig kidney holoenzyme, the dimer subunits move 20 Å apart and the two active sites become solvent exposed. Moreover, by tuning the PLP concentration in the crystals, we obtained two more structures with different conformations of the active site. Analysis of three-dimensional data coupled to a kinetic study allows to identify the structural determinants of the open/close conformational change occurring upon PLP binding and thereby propose a model for the preferential degradation of the apoenzymes of Group II decarboxylases.</p>

<p>An analogue of isoleucyl-adenylate (Ile-AMS) potently inhibits the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRSs) from the three primary kingdoms, whereas the antibiotic mupirocin inhibits only the eubacterial and archaeal IleRSs, but not the eukaryotic enzymes, and therefore is clinically used against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We determined the crystal structures of the IleRS from the thermophilic eubacterium, Thermus thermophilus, in complexes with Ile-AMS and mupirocin at 3.0- and 2.5-A resolutions, respectively. A structural comparison of the IleRS.Ile-AMS complex with the adenylate complexes of other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases revealed the common recognition mode of aminoacyl-adenylate by the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The Ile-AMS and mupirocin, which have significantly different chemical structures, are recognized by many of the same amino acid residues of the IleRS, suggesting that the antibiotic inhibits the enzymatic activity by blocking the binding site of the high energy intermediate, Ile-AMP. In contrast, the two amino acid residues that concomitantly recognize Ile-AMS and mupirocin are different between the eubacterial/archaeal IleRSs and the eukaryotic IleRSs. Mutagenic analyses revealed that the replacement of the two residues significantly changed the sensitivity to mupirocin.</p>

<p>Urease, a nickel-dependent metalloenzyme, is synthesized by plants, some bacteria, and fungi. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. Although the amino acid sequences of plant and bacterial ureases are closely related, some biological activities differ significantly. Plant ureases but not bacterial ureases possess insecticidal properties independent of its ureolytic activity. To date, the structural information is available only for bacterial ureases although the jack bean urease (Canavalia ensiformis; JBU), the best-studied plant urease, was the first enzyme to be crystallized in 1926. To better understand the biological properties of plant ureases including the mechanism of insecticidal activity, we initiated the structural studies on some of them. Here, we report the crystal structure of JBU, the first plant urease structure, at 2.05 A resolution. The active-site architecture of JBU is similar to that of bacterial ureases containing a bi-nickel center. JBU has a bound phosphate and covalently modified residue (Cys592) by beta-mercaptoethanol at its active site, and the concomitant binding of multiple inhibitors (phosphate and beta-mercaptoethanol) is not observed so far in bacterial ureases. By correlating the structural information of JBU with the available biophysical and biochemical data on insecticidal properties of plant ureases, we hypothesize that the amphipathic beta-hairpin located in the entomotoxic peptide region of plant ureases might form a membrane insertion beta-barrel as found in beta-pore-forming toxins.</p>

<p>AV411 (ibudilast; 3-isobutyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo-[1,5-a]pyridine) is an antiinflammatory drug that was initially developed for the treatment of bronchial asthma but which also has been used for cerebrovascular and ocular indications. It is a nonselective inhibitor of various phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and has varied antiinflammatory activity. More recently, AV411 has been studied as a possible therapeutic for the treatment of neuropathic pain and opioid withdrawal through its actions on glial cells. As described herein, the PDE inhibitor AV411 and its PDE-inhibition-compromised analog AV1013 inhibit the catalytic and chemotactic functions of the proinflammatory protein, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Enzymatic analysis indicates that these compounds are noncompetitive inhibitors of the p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) tautomerase activity of MIF and an allosteric binding site of AV411 and AV1013 is detected by NMR. The allosteric inhibition mechanism is further elucidated by X-ray crystallography based on the MIF/AV1013 binary and MIF/AV1013/HPP ternary complexes. In addition, our antibody experiments directed against MIF receptors indicate that CXCR2 is the major receptor for MIF-mediated chemotaxis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>

<p>Azole and triazole drugs are cytochrome P450 inhibitors widely used as fungal antibiotics and possessing potent antimycobacterial activity. We present here the crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cytochrome P450 CYP121 in complex with the triazole drug fluconazole, revealing a new azole heme ligation mode. In contrast to other structurally characterized cytochrome P450 azole complexes, where the azole nitrogen directly coordinates the heme iron, in CYP121 fluconazole does not displace the aqua sixth heme ligand but occupies a position that allows formation of a direct hydrogen bond to the aqua sixth heme ligand. Direct ligation of fluconazole to the heme iron is observed in a minority of CYP121 molecules, albeit with severe deviations from ideal geometry due to close contacts with active site residues. Analysis of both ligand-on and -off structures reveals the relative position of active site residues derived from the I-helix is a key determinant in the relative ratio of on and off states. Regardless, both ligand-bound states lead to P450 inactivation by active site occlusion. This previously unrecognized means of P450 inactivation is consistent with spectroscopic analyses in both solution and in the crystalline form and raises important questions relating to interaction of azoles with both pathogen and human P450s.</p>

<p>In many vertebrate tissues CD39-like ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) act in concert with ecto-5'-nucleotidase (e5NT, CD73) to convert extracellular ATP to adenosine. Extracellular ATP is a cytotoxic, pro-inflammatory signalling molecule whereas its product adenosine constitutes a universal and potent immune suppressor. Interference with these ectonucleotidases by use of small molecule inhibitors or inhibitory antibodies appears to be an effective strategy to enhance anti-tumour immunity and suppress neoangiogenesis. Here we present the first crystal structures of an NTPDase catalytic ectodomain in complex with the Reactive Blue 2 (RB2)-derived inhibitor PSB-071. In both of the two crystal forms presented the inhibitor binds as a sandwich of two molecules at the nucleoside binding site. One of the molecules is well defined in its orientation. Specific hydrogen bonds are formed between the sulfonyl group and the nucleoside binding loop. The methylphenyl side chain functionality that improved NTPDase2-specificity is sandwiched between R245 and R394, the latter of which is exclusively found in NTPDase2. The second molecule exhibits great in-plane rotational freedom and could not be modelled in a specific orientation. In addition to this structural insight into NTPDase inhibition, the observation of the putative membrane interaction loop (MIL) in two different conformations related by a 10° rotation identifies the MIL as a dynamic section of NTPDases that is potentially involved in regulation of catalysis. </p>

<p>The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a central piece in the replication machinery of RNA viruses. In picornaviruses this essential RdRp activity also uridylates the VPg peptide, which then serves as a primer for RNA synthesis. Previous genetic, binding, and biochemical data have identified a VPg binding site on poliovirus RdRp and have shown that is was implicated in VPg uridylation. More recent structural studies have identified a topologically distinct site on the closely related foot-and-mouth disease virus RdRp supposed to be the actual VPg-primer-binding site. Here, we report the crystal structure at 2.5-A resolution of active coxsackievirus B3 RdRp (also named 3D(pol)) in a complex with VPg and a pyrophosphate. The pyrophosphate is situated in the active-site cavity, occupying a putative binding site either for the coproduct of the reaction or an incoming NTP. VPg is bound at the base of the thumb subdomain, providing first structural evidence for the VPg binding site previously identified by genetic and biochemical methods. The binding mode of VPg to CVB3 3D(pol) at this site excludes its uridylation by the carrier 3D(pol). We suggest that VPg at this position is either uridylated by another 3D(pol) molecule or that it plays a stabilizing role within the uridylation complex. The CVB3 3D(pol)/VPg complex structure is expected to contribute to the understanding of the multicomponent VPg-uridylation complex essential for the initiation of genome replication of picornaviruses.</p>

<p>The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus grows optimally above 80 degrees C and utilizes an unusual, promiscuous, non-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway to metabolize both glucose and galactose. The first enzyme in this pathway, glucose dehydrogenase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconate, but has been shown to have activity with a broad range of sugar substrates, including glucose, galactose, xylose, and L-arabinose, with a requirement for the glucose stereo configuration at the C2 and C3 positions. Here we report the crystal structure of the apo form of glucose dehydrogenase to a resolution of 1.8 A and a complex with its required cofactor, NADP+, to a resolution of 2.3 A. A T41A mutation was engineered to enable the trapping of substrate in the crystal. Complexes of the enzyme with D-glucose and D-xylose are presented to resolutions of 1.6 and 1.5 A, respectively, that provide evidence of selectivity for the beta-anomeric, pyranose form of the substrate, and indicate that this is the productive substrate form. The nature of the promiscuity of glucose dehydrogenase is also elucidated, and a physiological role for this enzyme in xylose metabolism is suggested. Finally, the structure suggests that the mechanism of sugar oxidation by this enzyme may be similar to that described for human sorbitol dehydrogenase.</p>

<p>The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a central piece in the replication machinery of RNA viruses. In picornaviruses this essential RdRp activity also uridylates the VPg peptide, which then serves as a primer for RNA synthesis. Previous genetic, binding, and biochemical data have identified a VPg binding site on poliovirus RdRp and have shown that is was implicated in VPg uridylation. More recent structural studies have identified a topologically distinct site on the closely related foot-and-mouth disease virus RdRp supposed to be the actual VPg-primer-binding site.

<p>Asp kinase catalyzes the first step of the Asp-derived essential amino acid pathway in plants and microorganisms. Depending on the source organism, this enzyme contains up to four regulatory ACT domains and exhibits several isoforms under the control of a great variety of allosteric effectors. We report here the dimeric structure of a Lys and S-adenosylmethionine-sensitive Asp kinase isoform from Arabidopsis thaliana in complex with its two inhibitors. This work reveals the structure of an Asp kinase and an enzyme containing two ACT domains cocrystallized with its effectors. Only one ACT domain (ACT1) is implicated in effector binding. A loop involved in the binding of Lys and S-adenosylmethionine provides an explanation for the synergistic inhibition by these effectors. The presence of S-adenosylmethionine in the regulatory domain indicates that ACT domains are also able to bind nucleotides. The organization of ACT domains in the present structure is different from that observed in Thr deaminase and in the regulatory subunit of acetohydroxyacid synthase III.</p>

<p>Zinc RING finger 3 (ZNRF3) and its homolog RING finger 43 (RNF43) antagonize Wnt signaling in adult stem cells by ubiquitinating Frizzled receptors (FZD), which leads to endocytosis of the Wnt receptor. Conversely, binding of ZNRF3/RNF43 to LGR4-6 - R-spondin blocks Frizzled ubiquitination and enhances Wnt signaling. Here, we present crystal structures of the ZNRF3 ectodomain and its complex with R-spondin 1 (RSPO1). ZNRF3 binds RSPO1 and LGR5-RSPO1 with micromolar affinity via RSPO1 furin-like 1 (Fu1) domain. Anonychia-related mutations in RSPO4 support the importance of the observed interface. The ZNRF3-RSPO1 structure resembles that of LGR5-RSPO1-RNF43, though Fu2 of RSPO1 is variably oriented. The ZNRF3-binding site overlaps with trans-interactions observed in 2:2 LGR5-RSPO1 complexes, thus binding of ZNRF3/RNF43 would disrupt such an arrangement. Sequence conservation suggests a single ligand-binding site on ZNRF3, consistent with the proposed competing binding role of ZNRF3/RNF43 in Wnt signaling. </p>

<p>In many vertebrate tissues CD39-like ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) act in concert with ecto-5'-nucleotidase (e5NT, CD73) to convert extracellular ATP to adenosine. Extracellular ATP is a cytotoxic, pro-inflammatory signalling molecule whereas its product adenosine constitutes a universal and potent immune suppressor. Interference with these ectonucleotidases by use of small molecule inhibitors or inhibitory antibodies appears to be an effective strategy to enhance anti-tumour immunity and suppress neoangiogenesis. Here we present the first crystal structures of an NTPDase catalytic ectodomain in complex with the Reactive Blue 2 (RB2)-derived inhibitor PSB-071. In both of the two crystal forms presented the inhibitor binds as a sandwich of two molecules at the nucleoside binding site. One of the molecules is well defined in its orientation. Specific hydrogen bonds are formed between the sulfonyl group and the nucleoside binding loop. The methylphenyl side chain functionality that improved NTPDase2-specificity is sandwiched between R245 and R394, the latter of which is exclusively found in NTPDase2. The second molecule exhibits great in-plane rotational freedom and could not be modelled in a specific orientation. In addition to this structural insight into NTPDase inhibition, the observation of the putative membrane interaction loop (MIL) in two different conformations related by a 10° rotation identifies the MIL as a dynamic section of NTPDases that is potentially involved in regulation of catalysis. </p>

<p>Burkholderia cepacia complex and Burkholderia pseudomallei are opportunistic human pathogens. Resistance to β-lactams among Burkholderia spp. is attributable to expression of β-lactamases (e.g. PenA in B. cepacia complex and PenI in B. pseudomallei). Phylogenetic comparisons reveal that PenA and PenI are highly related. However, the analyses presented here reveal that PenA is an inhibitor-resistant carbapenemase, most similar to KPC-2 (the most clinically significant serine carbapenemase), whereas PenI is an extended spectrum β-lactamase. PenA hydrolyzes β-lactams with k(cat) values ranging from 0.38 ± 0.04 to 460 ± 46 s(-1) and possesses high k(cat)/k(inact) values of 2000, 1500, and 75 for β-lactamase inhibitors. PenI demonstrates the highest kcat value for cefotaxime of 9.0 ± 0.9 s(-1). Crystal structure determination of PenA and PenI reveals important differences that aid in understanding their contrasting phenotypes. Changes in the positioning of conserved catalytic residues (e.g. Lys-73, Ser-130, and Tyr-105) as well as altered anchoring and decreased occupancy of the deacylation water explain the lower k(cat) values of PenI. The crystal structure of PenA with imipenem docked into the active site suggests why this carbapenem is hydrolyzed and the important role of Arg-220, which was functionally confirmed by mutagenesis and biochemical characterization. Conversely, the conformation of Tyr-105 hindered docking of imipenem into the active site of PenI. The structural and biochemical analyses of PenA and PenI provide key insights into the hydrolytic mechanisms of β-lactamases, which can lead to the rational design of novel agents against these pathogens.</p>

<p>Haloacid dehalogenases have potential applications in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry as well as in the remediation of contaminated land. The L: -2-haloacid dehalogenase from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii has been cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli and successfully purified to homogeneity. Here we report the structure of the recombinant dehalogenase solved by molecular replacement in two different crystal forms. The enzyme is a homodimer with each monomer being composed of a core-domain of a beta-sheet bundle surrounded by alpha-helices and an alpha-helical sub-domain. This fold is similar to previously solved mesophilic L: -haloacid dehalogenase structures. The monoclinic crystal form contains a putative inhibitor L: -lactate in the active site. The enzyme displays haloacid dehalogenase activity towards carboxylic acids with the halide attached at the C2 position with the highest activity towards chloropropionic acid. The enzyme is thermostable with maximum activity at 60 degrees C and a half-life of over 1 h at 70 degrees C. The enzyme is relatively stable to solvents with 25% activity lost when incubated for 1 h in 20% v/v DMSO.</p>

<p>The structure of human cytosolic thymidine kinase in complex with its feedback inhibitor 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-triphosphate was determined. This structure is the first representative of the type II thymidine kinases found in several pathogens. The structure deviates strongly from the known structures of type I thymidine kinases such as the Herpes simplex enzyme. It contains a zinc-binding domain with four cysteines complexing a structural zinc ion. Interestingly, the backbone atoms of the type II enzyme bind thymine via hydrogen-bonds, in contrast to type I, where side chains are involved. This results in a specificity difference exploited for antiviral therapy. The presented structure will foster the development of new drugs and prodrugs for numerous therapeutic applications.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis remains a serious global health threat, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains highlighting the urgent need for novel antituberculosis drugs. The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) catalyzes the first step of the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds. This pathway has been shown to be essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen responsible for tuberculosis. DAH7PS catalyzes a condensation reaction between P-enolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate to give 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate. The enzyme reaction mechanism is proposed to include a tetrahedral intermediate, which is formed by attack of an active site water on the central carbon of P-enolpyruvate during the course of the reaction. Molecular modeling of this intermediate into the active site reported in this study shows a configurational preference consistent with water attack from the re face of P-enolpyruvate. Based on this model, we designed and synthesized an inhibitor of DAH7PS that mimics this reaction intermediate. Both enantiomers of this intermediate mimic were potent inhibitors of M. tuberculosis DAH7PS, with inhibitory constants in the nanomolar range. The crystal structure of the DAH7PS-inhibitor complex was solved to 2.35 Å. Both the position of the inhibitor and the conformational changes of active site residues observed in this structure correspond closely to the predictions from the intermediate modeling. This structure also identifies a water molecule that is located in the appropriate position to attack the re face of P-enolpyruvate during the course of the reaction, allowing the catalytic mechanism for this enzyme to be clearly defined.</p>

<p>The relationship between the structures of protein-ligand complexes existing in the crystal and in solution, essential in the case of fragment-based screening by X-ray crystallography (FBS-X), has been often an object of controversy. To address this question, simultaneous co-crystallization and soaking of two inhibitors with different ratios, Fidarestat (FID; K(d) = 6.5 nM) and IDD594 (594; K(d) = 61 nM), which bind to h-aldose reductase (AR), have been performed. The subatomic resolution of the crystal structures allows the differentiation of both inhibitors, even when the structures are almost superposed. We have determined the occupation ratio in solution by mass spectrometry (MS) Occ(FID)/Occ(594) = 2.7 and by X-ray crystallography Occ(FID)/Occ(594) = 0.6. The occupancies in the crystal and in solution differ 4.6 times, implying that ligand binding potency is influenced by crystal contacts. A structural analysis shows that the Loop A (residues 122-130), which is exposed to the solvent, is flexible in solution, and is involved in packing contacts within the crystal. Furthermore, inhibitor 594 contacts the base of Loop A, stabilizing it, while inhibitor FID does not. This is shown by the difference in B-factors of the Loop A between the AR-594 and AR-FID complexes. A stable loop diminishes the entropic energy barrier to binding, favoring 594 versus FID. Therefore, the effect of the crystal environment should be taken into consideration in the X-ray diffraction analysis of ligand binding to proteins. This conclusion highlights the need for additional methodologies in the case of FBS-X to validate this powerful screening technique, which is widely used.</p>

<p>Microbial enzymes produced in the gastrointestinal tract are primarily responsible for the release and biochemical transformation of absorbable bioactive monophenols.

<p>The incorporation of dNMPs into DNA by polymerases involves a phosphoryl transfer reaction hypothesized to require two divalent metal ions. Here we investigate this hypothesis using as a model human DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda), an enzyme suggested to be activated in vivo by manganese. We report the crystal structures of four complexes of human Pol lambda. In a 1.9 A structure of Pol lambda containing a 3'-OH and the non-hydrolyzable analog dUpnpp, a non-catalytic Na+ ion occupies the site for metal A and the ribose of the primer-terminal nucleotide is found in a conformation that positions the acceptor 3'-OH out of line with the alpha-phosphate and the bridging oxygen of the pyrophosphate leaving group. Soaking this crystal in MnCl2 yielded a 2.0 A structure with Mn2+ occupying the site for metal A. In the presence of Mn2+, the conformation of the ribose is C3'-endo and the 3'-oxygen is in line with the leaving oxygen, at a distance from the phosphorus atom of the alpha-phosphate (3.69 A) consistent with and supporting a catalytic mechanism involving two divalent metal ions. Finally, soaking with MnCl2 converted a pre-catalytic Pol lambda/Na+ complex with unreacted dCTP in the active site into a product complex via catalysis in the crystal. These data provide pre- and post-transition state information and outline in a single crystal the pathway for the phosphoryl transfer reaction carried out by DNA polymerases.</p>

<p>Hereditary deficiency of factor IXa (fIXa), a key enzyme in blood coagulation, causes hemophilia B, a severe X chromosome-linked bleeding disorder afflicting 1 in 30,000 males; clinical studies have identified nearly 500 deleterious variants. The x-ray structure of porcine fIXa described here shows the atomic origins of the disease, while the spatial distribution of mutation sites suggests a structural model for factor X activation by phospholipid-bound fIXa and cofactor VIIIa. The 3.0-A-resolution diffraction data clearly show the structures of the serine proteinase module and the two preceding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules; the N-terminal Gla module is partially disordered. The catalytic module, with covalent inhibitor D-Phe-1I-Pro-2I-Arg-3I chloromethyl ketone, most closely resembles fXa but differs significantly at several positions. Particularly noteworthy is the strained conformation of Glu-388, a residue strictly conserved in known fIXa sequences but conserved as Gly among other trypsin-like serine proteinases. Flexibility apparent in electron density together with modeling studies suggests that this may cause incomplete active site formation, even after zymogen, and hence the low catalytic activity of fIXa. The principal axes of the oblong EGF-like domains define an angle of 110 degrees, stabilized by a strictly conserved and fIX-specific interdomain salt bridge. The disorder of the Gla module, whose hydrophobic helix is apparent in electron density, can be attributed to the absence of calcium in the crystals; we have modeled the Gla module in its calcium form by using prothrombin fragment 1. The arched module arrangement agrees with fluorescence energy transfer experiments. Most hemophilic mutation sites of surface fIX residues occur on the concave surface of the bent molecule and suggest a plausible model for the membrane-bound ternary fIXa-FVIIIa-fX complex structure: fIXa and an equivalently arranged fX arch across an underlying fVIIIa subdomain from opposite sides; the stabilizing fVIIIa interactions force the catalytic modules together, completing fIXa active site formation and catalytic enhancement.</p>

<p>hGAPDS (human sperm-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is a glycolytic enzyme essential for the survival of spermatozoa, and constitutes a potential target for non-hormonal contraception. However, enzyme characterization of GAPDS has been hampered by the difficulty in producing soluble recombinant protein. In the present study, we have overexpressed in Escherichia coli a highly soluble form of hGAPDS truncated at the N-terminus (hGAPDSΔN), and crystallized the homotetrameric enzyme in two ligand complexes. The hGAPDSΔN-NAD+-phosphate structure maps the two anion-recognition sites within the catalytic pocket that correspond to the conserved Ps site and the newly recognized Pi site identified in other organisms. The hGAPDSΔN-NAD+-glycerol structure shows serendipitous binding of glycerol at the Ps and new Pi sites, demonstrating the propensity of these anion-recognition sites to bind non-physiologically relevant ligands. A comparison of kinetic profiles between hGAPDSΔN and its somatic equivalent reveals a 3-fold increase in catalytic efficiency for hGAPDSΔN. This may be attributable to subtle amino acid substitutions peripheral to the active centre that influence the charge properties and protonation states of catalytic residues. Our data therefore elucidate structural and kinetic features of hGAPDS that might provide insightful information towards inhibitor development.</p>

<p>Sirtuin enzymes comprise a unique class of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases. Although structures of many sirtuin complexes have been determined, structural resolution of intermediate chemical steps are needed to understand the deacetylation mechanism. We report crystal structures of the bacterial sirtuin, Sir2Tm, in complex with an S-alkylamidate intermediate, analogous to the naturally occurring O-alkylamidate intermediate, and a Sir2Tm ternary complex containing a dissociated NAD(+) analog and acetylated peptide. The structures and biochemical studies reveal critical roles for the invariant active site histidine in positioning the reaction intermediate, and for a conserved phenylalanine residue in shielding reaction intermediates from base exchange with nicotinamide. The new structural and biochemical studies provide key mechanistic insight into intermediate steps of the Sir2 deacetylation reaction.</p>

<p>A site-directed mutagenesis, D244E, of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase) changes drastically the nature of the protein, especially the NAD(+) binding affinity. The mutant enzyme contained NADH rather than NAD(+) (Gomi, T., Takata, Y., Date, T., Fujioka, M., Aksamit, R. R., Backlund, P. S., and Cantoni, G. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16102-16107). In contrast to the site-directed mutagenesis study, the crystal structures of human and rat AdoHcyase recently determined have shown that the carboxyl group of Asp-244 points in a direction opposite to the bound NAD molecule and does not participate in any hydrogen bonds with the NAD molecule. To explain the discrepancy between the mutagenesis study and the x-ray studies, we have determined the crystal structure of the recombinant rat-liver D244E mutant enzyme to 2.8-A resolution. The D244E mutation changes the enzyme structure from the open to the closed conformation by means of a approximately 17 degrees rotation of the individual catalytic domains around the molecular hinge sections. The D244E mutation shifts the catalytic reaction from a reversible to an irreversible fashion. The large affinity difference between NAD(+) and NADH is mainly due to the enzyme conformation, but not to the binding-site geometry; an NAD(+) in the open conformation is readily released from the enzyme, whereas an NADH in the closed conformation is trapped and cannot leave the enzyme. A catalytic mechanism of AdoHcyase has been proposed on the basis of the crystal structures of the wild-type and D244E enzymes.</p>

<p>The homotrimeric fusion protein nucleocapsid (NC)-dUTPase combines domains that participate in RNA/DNA folding, reverse transcription, and DNA repair in Mason-Pfizer monkey betaretrovirus infected cells. The structural organization of the fusion protein remained obscured by the N- and C-terminal flexible segments of dUTPase and the linker region connecting the two domains that are invisible in electron density maps. Small-angle X-ray scattering reveals that upon oligonucleotide binding the NC domains adopt the trimeric symmetry of dUTPase. High-resolution X-ray structures together with molecular modeling indicate that fusion with NC domains dramatically alters the conformation of the flexible C-terminus by perturbing the orientation of a critical beta-strand. Consequently, the C-terminal segment is capable of double backing upon the active site of its own monomer and stabilized by non-covalent interactions formed with the N-terminal segment. This co-folding of the dUTPase terminal segments, not observable in other homologous enzymes, is due to the presence of the fused NC domain. Structural and genomic advantages of fusing the NC domain to a shortened dUTPase in betaretroviruses and the possible physiological consequences are envisaged.</p>

<p>The two front-line drugs for chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infections are limited by adverse side-effects and declining efficacy.

<p>Influenza antiviral agents play important roles in modulating disease severity and in controlling pandemics while vaccines are prepared, but the development of resistance to agents like the commonly used neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir may limit their future utility. We report here on a new class of specific, mechanism-based anti-influenza drugs that function through the formation of a stabilized covalent intermediate in the influenza neuraminidase enzyme, and we confirm this mode of action with structural and mechanistic studies. These compounds function in cell-based assays and in animal models, with efficacies comparable to that of the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir and with broad-spectrum activity against drug-resistant strains in vitro. The similarity of their structure to that of the natural substrate and their mechanism-based design make these attractive antiviral candidates.</p>

<p>Cytosine deaminase (CD) catalyzes the deamination of cytosine, producing uracil. This enzyme is present in prokaryotes and fungi (but not multicellular eukaryotes) and is an important member of the pyrimidine salvage pathway in those organisms. The same enzyme also catalyzes the conversion of 5-fluorocytosine to 5-fluorouracil; this activity allows the formation of a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent from a non-cytotoxic precursor. The enzyme is of widespread interest both for antimicrobial drug design and for gene therapy applications against tumors. The structure of Escherichia coli CD has been determined in the presence and absence of a bound mechanism-based inhibitor. The enzyme forms an (alphabeta)(8) barrel structure with structural similarity to adenosine deaminase, a relationship that is undetectable at the sequence level, and no similarity to bacterial cytidine deaminase. The enzyme is packed into a hexameric assembly stabilized by a unique domain-swapping interaction between enzyme subunits. The active site is located in the mouth of the enzyme barrel and contains a bound iron ion that coordinates a hydroxyl nucleophile. Substrate binding involves a significant conformational change that sequesters the reaction complex from solvent.</p>

<p>Complete cellulose degradation is the first step in the use of biomass as a source of renewable energy. To this end, the engineering of novel cellulase activity, the activity responsible for the hydrolysis of the beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose, is a topic of great interest. The high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of a multidomain endoglucanase from Clostridium cellulolyticum has been determined at a 1.6-A resolution. The endoglucanase, Cel9G, is comprised of a family 9 catalytic domain attached to a family III(c) cellulose-binding domain. The two domains together form a flat platform onto which crystalline cellulose is suggested to bind and be fed into the active-site cleft for endolytic hydrolysis. To further dissect the structural basis of cellulose binding and hydrolysis, the structures of Cel9G in the presence of cellobiose, cellotriose, and a DP-10 thio-oligosaccharide inhibitor were resolved at resolutions of 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 A, respectively.</p>

<p>Carboxylate-bridged diiron hydroxylases are multicomponent enzyme complexes responsible for the catabolism of a wide range of hydrocarbons and as such have drawn attention for their mechanism of action and potential uses in bioremediation and enzymatic synthesis. These enzyme complexes use a small molecular weight effector protein to modulate the function of the hydroxylase. However, the origin of these functional changes is poorly understood. Here, we report the structures of the biologically relevant effector protein-hydroxylase complex of toluene 4-monooxygenase in 2 redox states. The structures reveal a number of coordinated changes that occur up to 25 A from the active site and poise the diiron center for catalysis. The results provide a structural basis for the changes observed in a number of the measurable properties associated with effector protein binding. This description provides insight into the functional role of effector protein binding in all carboxylate-bridged diiron hydroxylases.</p>

<p>Structural snapshots of each step in the catalytic cycle would help development of inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease (HIV-1 PR) as effective drugs against HIV/AIDS. We report here one snapshot obtained by determining the structure of enzyme-substrate complex under conditions where the catalytic activity of the enzyme is greatly reduced. The 1.76 A crystal structure shows the oligopeptide substrate, AETFYVDGAA, converted in situ into a gem-diol tetrahedral intermediate (TI). The gem-diol intermediate is neutral and one of the hydroxyl oxygens forms a very short hydrogen bond (2.2 A) with the anionic aspartate of the catalytic dyad, which is monoprotonated. Further, there is no hydrogen atom on the outer oxygen of the neutral aspartate. These two observations provide direct evidence that, in the reaction mechanism, hydrogen bonding between catalytic aspartate and scissile carbonyl oxygen facilitates water attack on the scissile carbon atom. Comparison with the structural snapshot of the biproduct complex involving the same substrate reveals the reorganization of the hydrogen bonds at the catalytic center as the enzymatic reaction progresses toward completion.

<p>Coenzyme F(420), a hydride carrier, is found in Archaea and some bacteria and has crucial roles in methanogenesis, antibiotic biosynthesis, DNA repair, and activation of antitubercular compounds. CofD, 2-phospho-l-lactate transferase, catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of F(420)-0 (F(420) without polyglutamate), by transferring the lactyl phosphate moiety of lactyl(2)diphospho-(5')guanosine to 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin ribitol (Fo). CofD is highly conserved among F(420)-producing organisms, and weak sequence homologs are also found in non-F(420)-producing organisms. This superfamily does not share any recognizable sequence conservation with other proteins. Here we report the first crystal structures of CofD, the free enzyme and two ternary complexes, with Fo and P(i) or with Fo and GDP, from Methanosarcina mazei. The active site is located at the C-terminal end of a Rossmann fold core, and three large insertions make significant contributions to the active site and dimer formation. The observed binding modes of Fo and GDP can explain known biochemical properties of CofD and are also supported by our binding assays. The structures provide significant molecular insights into the biosynthesis of the F(420) coenzyme. Large structural differences in the active site region of the non-F(420)-producing CofD homologs suggest that they catalyze a different biochemical reaction.</p>

<p>The ribosomal P70 S6 kinases play a crucial role in PI3K/mTOR regulated signalling pathways and are therefore potential targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases including diabetes and cancer. In this study we describe the identification of three series of chemically distinct S6K1 inhibitors. In addition, we report a novel PKA-S6K1 chimeric protein with five mutations in or near its ATP-binding site, which was used to determine the binding mode of two of the three inhibitor series, and provided a robust system to aid the optimisation of the oxadiazole-substituted benzimidazole inhibitor series. We show that the resulting oxadiazole-substituted aza-benzimidazole is a potent and ligand efficient S6 kinase inhibitor, which blocks the phosphorylation of RPS6 at Ser235/236 in TSC negative HCV29 human bladder cancer cells by inhibiting S6 kinase activity and thus provides a useful tool compound to investigate the function of S6 kinases. </p>

<p>Two distinct groups of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS), a key enzyme of cell-wall biosynthesis, differ by their requirement for a divalent metal ion for enzymatic activity. The unique difference between these groups is the replacement of the metal-binding Cys by Asn. Substitution of just this Asn for a Cys in metal-independent KDO8PS does not create the obligate metal-ion dependency of natural metal-dependent enzymes. We describe how three or four mutations of the metal-independent KDO8PS from Neisseria meningitidis produce a fully functional, obligately metal-dependent KDO8PS. For the substitutions Asn23Cys, Asp247Glu (this Asp binds to the metal ion in all metal-dependent KDO8PS) and Pro249Ala, and for double and triple combinations, mutant enzymes that contained Cys in place of Asn showed an increase in activity in the presence of divalent metal ions. However, combining these mutations with substitution by Ser of the Cys residue in the conserved (246)CysAspGlyPro(249) motif of metal-independent KDO8PS created enzymes with obligate metal dependency. The quadruple mutant (Asn23Cys/Cys246Ser/Asp247Glu/Pro249Ala) showed comparable activity to wild-type enzymes only in the presence of metal ions, with maximum activity with Cd(2+), the metal ion that is strongly inhibitory at micromolar concentrations for the wild-type enzyme. In the absence of metal ions, activity was barely detectable for this quadruple mutant or for triple mutants bearing both Cys246Ser and Asn23Cys mutations. The structures of NmeKDO8PS and its Asn23Cys/Asp247Glu/Pro249Ala and quadruple mutants at pH 4.6 were characterized at resolutions better than 1.85 A. Aged crystals of the Asn23Cys/Asp247Glu/Pro249Ala mutant featured a Cys23-Cys246 disulfide linkage, explaining the spectral bleaching observed when this mutant was incubated with Cu(2+). Such bleaching was not observed for the quadruple mutant. Reverse evolution to a fully functional obligately metal-dependent KDO8PS has been achieved with just three directed mutations for enzymes that have, at best, 47% identity between metal-dependent and metal-independent pairs.</p>

<p>A role for conformational change in the coupling mechanism of cytochrome c oxidase is the subject of controversy. Relatively small conformational changes have been reported in comparisons of reduced and oxidized crystal structures of bovine oxidase but none in bacterial oxidases. Comparing the X-ray crystal structures of the reduced (at 2.15 A resolution) and oxidized forms of cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, we observe a displacement of heme a(3) involving both the porphyrin ring and the hydroxyl farnesyl tail, accompanied by protein movements in nearby regions, including the mid part of helix VIII of subunit I which harbors key residues of the K proton uptake path, K362 and T359. The conformational changes in the reduced form are reversible upon reoxidation. They result in an opening of the top of the K pathway and more ordered waters being resolved in that region, suggesting an access path for protons into the active site. In all high-resolution structures of oxidized R. sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase, a water molecule is observed in the hydrophobic region above the top of the D path, strategically positioned to facilitate the connection of residue E286 of subunit I to the active site or to the proton pumping exit path. In the reduced and reduced plus cyanide structures, this water molecule disappears, implying disruption of proton conduction from the D path under conditions when the K path is open, thus providing a mechanism for alternating access to the active site.</p>

<p>Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) allosterically regulates pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. The enzyme is inhibited by CTP and can be further inhibited by UTP, although UTP alone has little or no influence on activity; however, the mechanism for the synergistic inhibition is still unknown. To determine how UTP is able to synergistically inhibit ATCase in the presence of CTP, we determined a series of X-ray structures of ATCase·nucleotide complexes. Analysis of the X-ray structures revealed that (1) CTP and dCTP bind in a very similar fashion, (2) UTP, in the presence of dCTP or CTP, binds at a site that does not overlap the CTP/dCTP site, and (3) the triphosphates of the two nucleotides are parallel to each other with a metal ion, in this case Mg(2+), coordinated between the β- and γ-phosphates of the two nucleotides. Kinetic experiments showed that the presence of a metal ion such as Mg(2+) is required for synergistic inhibition. Together, these results explain how the binding of UTP can enhance the binding of CTP and why UTP binds more tightly in the presence of CTP. A mechanism for the synergistic inhibition of ATCase is proposed in which the presence of UTP stabilizes the T state even more than CTP alone. These results also call into question many of the past kinetic and binding experiments with ATCase with nucleotides as the presence of metal contamination was not considered important.</p>

<p>Ubiquitous bacteria from the genus Oleispira drive oil degradation in the largest environment on Earth, the cold and deep sea. Here we report the genome sequence of Oleispira antarctica and show that compared with Alcanivorax borkumensis--the paradigm of mesophilic hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria--O. antarctica has a larger genome that has witnessed massive gene-transfer events. We identify an array of alkane monooxygenases, osmoprotectants, siderophores and micronutrient-scavenging pathways. We also show that at low temperatures, the main protein-folding machine Cpn60 functions as a single heptameric barrel that uses larger proteins as substrates compared with the classical double-barrel structure observed at higher temperatures. With 11 protein crystal structures, we further report the largest set of structures from one psychrotolerant organism. The most common structural feature is an increased content of surface-exposed negatively charged residues compared to their mesophilic counterparts. Our findings are relevant in the context of microbial cold-adaptation mechanisms and the development of strategies for oil-spill mitigation in cold environments.</p>

<p>1, 4-Dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl coenzyme A (DHNA-CoA) synthase is a typical crotonase fold enzyme with an implicated role of conformational changes in catalysis. We have identified these conformational changes by determining the structures of its Escherichia coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 orthologues in complex with a product analog. The structural changes include the folding of an active-site loop into a β-hairpin and significant reorientation of a helix at the carboxy terminus. Interestingly, a new interface is formed between the ordered loop and the reoriented helix, both of which also form additional interactions with the coenzyme A moiety of the ligand. Site-directed mutation of the amino acid residues involved in these ligand-induced interactions significantly diminishes the enzyme activity. These results suggest a catalytically essential induced-fit that is likely initiated by the enzyme-ligand interactions at the active site.</p>

<p>Prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRSs) are unique among synthetases in that they have diverse architectures, notably the variable presence of a cis-editing domain homologous to the freestanding deacylase proteins YbaK and ProX. Here, we describe crystal structures of two bacterial ProRSs from the pathogen Enterococcus faecalis, which possesses an editing domain, and from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, which does not. We compare the overall structure and binding mode of ATP and prolyl-adenylate with those of the archael/eukaryote-type ProRS from Thermus thermophilus. Although structurally more homologous to YbaK, which preferentially hydrolyzes Cys-tRNA(Pro), the editing domain of E. faecalis ProRS possesses key elements similar to ProX, with which it shares the activity of hydrolyzing Ala-tRNA(Pro). The structures give insight into the complex evolution of ProRSs, the mechanism of editing, and structural differences between prokaryotic- and eukaryotic-type ProRSs that can be exploited for antibiotic design.</p>

<p>The first crystallographic structures of a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from a Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus opacus 1CP (Rho 1,2-CTD), a Fe(III) ion containing enzyme specialized in the aerobic biodegradation of catechols, and its adducts with catechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrogallol (benzene-1,2,3-triol), 3-chlorocatechol, 4-chlorocatechol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate) have been determined and analyzed. This study represents the first extensive characterization of catechols adducts of 1,2-CTDs. The structural analyses reveal the diverse modes of binding to the active metal iron ion of the tested catechols thus allowing to identify the residues selectively involved in recognition of the diverse substrates by this class of enzymes. The comparison is further extended to the structural and functional characteristics of the other 1,2-CTDs isolated from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover the high structural homology of the present enzyme with the 3-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from the same bacterium are discussed in terms of their different substrate specificity. The catalytic rates for Rho 1,2-CTD conversion of the tested compounds are also compared with the calculated energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (E(HOMO)) of the substrates. A quantitative relationship (R=0.966) between the ln k(cat) and the calculated electronic parameter E(HOMO) was obtained for catechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrogallol, 3-chlorocatechol, 4-chlorocatechol. This indicates that for these substrates the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle is dependent on their nucleophilic reactivity. The discrepancies observed in the quantitative relationship for 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and protocatechuate are ascribed to the sterical hindrances leading to the distorted binding of such catechols observed in the corresponding structures.</p>

<p>Structure-based design (SBD) can be used for the design and/or optimization of new inhibitors for a biological target. Whereas de novo SBD is rarely used, most reports on SBD are dealing with the optimization of an initial hit. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) has emerged as a powerful strategy to identify bioactive ligands given that it enables the target to direct the synthesis of its strongest binder. We have designed a library of potential inhibitors (acylhydrazones) generated from five aldehydes and five hydrazides and used DCC to identify the best binder(s). After addition of the aspartic protease endothiapepsin, we characterized the protein-bound library member(s) by saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. Cocrystallization experiments validated the predicted binding mode of the two most potent inhibitors, thus demonstrating that the combination of de novo SBD and DCC constitutes an efficient starting point for hit identification and optimization. </p>

<p>We have sought the structural basis for the differing substrate specificities of human glutathione transferase P1-1 (class Pi) and human glutathione transferase A1-1 (class Alpha) by adding an extra helix (helix 9), found in the electrophilic substrate-binding site (H-site) of the human class Alpha enzyme, at the C terminus of the human class Pi enzyme. This class Pi-chimera (CODA) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized by kinetic and crystallographic approaches. The presence of the newly engineered tail in the H-site of the human Pi enzyme alters its catalytic properties towards those exhibited by the human Alpha enzyme, as assessed using cumene hydroperoxide (diagnostic for class Alpha enzymes) and ethacrynic acid (diagnostic for class Pi) as co-substrates. There is a change of substrate selectivity in the latter case, as the k(cat)/K(m)(EA) value decreases about 70-fold, compared to that of class Pi. With 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as co-substrate there is a loss of catalytic activity to about 2% with respect to that of the Pi enzyme. Crystallographic and kinetic studies of the class Pi-chimera provide important clues to explain these altered catalytic properties. The new helix forms many complimentary interactions with the rest of the protein and re-models the original electrophilic substrate-binding site towards one that is more enclosed, albeit flexible. Of particular note are the interactions between Glu205 of the new tail and the catalytic residues, Tyr7 and Tyr108, and the thiol moiety of glutathione (GSH). These interactions may provide an explanation of the more than one unit increase in the pK(a) value of the GSH thiolate and affect both the turnover number and GSH binding, using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as co-substrate. The data presented are consistent with the engineered tail adopting a highly mobile or disordered state in the apo form of the enzyme.</p>

<p>The enzymatic degradation of recalcitrant plant biomass is one of the key industrial challenges of the 21st century. Accordingly, there is a continuing drive to discover new routes to promote polysaccharide degradation. Perhaps the most promising approach involves the application of "cellulase-enhancing factors," such as those from the glycoside hydrolase (CAZy) GH61 family. Here we show that GH61 enzymes are a unique family of copper-dependent oxidases. We demonstrate that copper is needed for GH61 maximal activity and that the formation of cellodextrin and oxidized cellodextrin products by GH61 is enhanced in the presence of small molecule redox-active cofactors such as ascorbate and gallate. By using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the active site of GH61 is revealed to contain a type II copper and, uniquely, a methylated histidine in the copper's coordination sphere, thus providing an innovative paradigm in bioinorganic enzymatic catalysis.</p>

<p>EryK is a bacterial cytochrome P450 that catalyzes the last hydroxylation occurring during the biosynthetic pathway of erythromycin A in Streptomyces erythraeus. We report the crystal structures of EryK in complex with two widely used azole inhibitors: ketoconazole and clotrimazole. Both of these ligands use their imidazole moiety to coordinate the heme iron of P450s. Nevertheless, because of the different chemical and structural properties of their N1-substituent group, ketoconazole and clotrimazole trap EryK, respectively, in a closed and in an open conformation that resemble the two structures previously described for the ligand-free EryK. Indeed, ligands induce a distortion of the internal helix I that affects the accessibility of the binding pocket by regulating the kink of the external helix G via a network of interactions that involves helix F. The data presented thus constitute an example of how a cytochrome P450 may be selectively trapped in different conformational states by inhibitors.</p>

<p>Ferritins are a family of proteins distributed widely in nature. In bacterial, plant, and animal cells, ferritin appears to serve as a soluble, bioavailable, and non-toxic form of iron provider. Ferritins from animal sources are heteropolymers composed of two types of subunit, H and L, which differ mainly by the presence (H) or absence (L) of active ferroxidase centres. We report the crystallographic structures of four human H apoferritin variants at a resolution of up to 1.5 Angstrom. Crystal derivatives using Zn(II) as redox-stable alternative for Fe(II), allows us to characterize the different metal-binding sites. The ferroxidase centre, which is composed of sites A and B, binds metal with a preference for the A site. In addition, distinct Zn(II)-binding sites were found in the 3-fold axes, 4-fold axes and on the cavity surface near the ferroxidase centre. To study the importance of the distance of the two metal atoms in the ferroxidase centre, single and double replacement of glutamate 27 (site A) and glutamate 107 (site B), the two axial ligands, by aspartate residues have been carried out. The consequences for metal binding and the correlation with Fe(II) oxidation rates are discussed.</p>

<p>The enzymatic degradation of the plant cell wall is central both to the natural carbon cycle and, increasingly, to environmentally friendly routes to biomass conversion, including the production of biofuels. The plant cell wall is a complex composite of cellulose microfibrils embedded in diverse polysaccharides collectively termed hemicelluloses. Xyloglucan is one such polysaccharide whose hydrolysis is catalyzed by diverse xyloglucanases. Here we present the structure of the Clostridium thermocellum xyloglucanase Xgh74A in both apo and ligand-complexed forms. The structures, in combination with mutagenesis data on the catalytic residues and the kinetics and specificity of xyloglucan hydrolysis reveal a complex subsite specificity accommodating seventeen monosaccharide moieties of the multibranched substrate in an open substrate binding terrain.</p>

<p>The MYST protein lysine acetyltransferases are evolutionarily conserved throughout eukaryotes and acetylate proteins to regulate diverse biological processes including gene regulation, DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, stem cell homeostasis and development. Here, we demonstrate that MYST protein acetyltransferase activity requires active site lysine autoacetylation. The X-ray crystal structures of yeast Esa1 (yEsa1/KAT5) bound to a bisubstrate H4K16CoA inhibitor and human MOF (hMOF/KAT8/MYST1) reveal that they are autoacetylated at a strictly conserved lysine residue in MYST proteins (yEsa1-K262 and hMOF-K274) in the enzyme active site. The structure of hMOF also shows partial occupancy of K274 in the unacetylated form, revealing that the side chain reorients to a position that engages the catalytic glutamate residue and would block cognate protein substrate binding. Consistent with the structural findings, we present mass spectrometry data and biochemical experiments to demonstrate that this lysine autoacetylation on yEsa1, hMOF and its yeast orthologue, ySas2 (KAT8) occurs in solution and is required for acetylation and protein substrate binding in vitro. We also show that this autoacetylation occurs in vivo and is required for the cellular functions of these MYST proteins. These findings provide an avenue for the autoposttranslational regulation of MYST proteins that is distinct from other acetyltransferases but draws similarities to the phosphoregulation of protein kinases.</p>

<p>A series of mutants of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), at residues that interact with the inhibited enzyme subtilisin BPN', were studied to determine the relative importance of intermolecular contacts on either side of the scissile bond. Mutants were tested for inhibition of subtilisin, rates of hydrolysis by subtilisin, and ability to acylate subtilisin. Additionally, crystal structures of the mutant CI2 complexes with subtilisin were obtained. Ordered water molecules were found to play an important role in inhibitor recognition, and features of the crystal structures, in combination with biochemical data, support a transition-state stabilization role for the P(1) residue in subtilisin catalysis. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition, in which rapid acylation is followed by religation, leaving-group contacts with the enzyme were found to be more critical determinants of inhibition than acylating-group contacts in the mutants studied here.</p>

<p>Chagasin is a protein produced by Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas' disease. This small protein belongs to a recently defined family of cysteine protease inhibitors. Although resembling well-known inhibitors like the cystatins in size (110 amino acid residues) and function (they all inhibit papain-like (C1 family) proteases), it has a unique amino acid sequence and structure. We have crystallized and solved the structure of chagasin in complex with the host cysteine protease, cathepsin L, at 1.75 A resolution. An inhibitory wedge composed of three loops (L2, L4, and L6) forms a number of contacts responsible for high-affinity binding (K(i), 39 pM) to the enzyme. All three loops interact with the catalytic groove, with the central loop L2 inserted directly into the catalytic center. Loops L4 and L6 embrace the enzyme molecule from both sides and exhibit distinctly different patterns of protein-protein recognition. Comparison with a 1.7 A structure of uncomplexed chagasin, also determined in this study, demonstrates that a conformational change of the first binding loop (L4) allows extended binding to the non-primed substrate pockets of the enzyme active site cleft, thereby providing a substantial part of the inhibitory surface. The mode of chagasin binding is generally similar, albeit distinctly different in detail, when compared to those displayed by cystatins and the cysteine protease inhibitory p41 fragment of the invariant chain. The chagasin-cathepsin L complex structure provides details of how the parasite protein inhibits a host enzyme of possible importance in host defense. The high level of structural and functional similarity between cathepsin L and the T. cruzi enzyme cruzipain gives clues to how the cysteine protease activity of the parasite can be targeted. This information will aid in the development of synthetic inhibitors for use as potential drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease.</p>

<p>Variants of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) with amino acid replacements at residues in contact with water molecules in the active-site cavity have provided insights into the proton transfer rates in this protein environment. X-ray crystallography and (18)O exchange measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry have been used to investigate structural and catalytic properties of variants of HCA II containing replacements of Tyr7 with Phe (Y7F) and Asn67 with Gln (N67Q). The rate constants for transfer of a proton from His64 to the zinc-bound hydroxide during catalysis were 4 and 9 μs(-1) for Y7F and Y7F/N67Q, respectively, compared with a value of 0.8 μs(-1) for wild-type HCA II. These higher values observed for Y7F and Y7F/N67Q HCA II could not be explained by differences in the values of the pK(a) of the proton donor (His64) and acceptor (zinc-bound hydroxide) or by the orientation of the side chain of the proton shuttle residue His64. They appeared to be associated with a reduced level of branching in the networks of hydrogen-bonded water molecules between proton shuttle residue His64 and the zinc-bound solvent molecule as observed in crystal structures at 1.5-1.6 Å resolution. Moreover, Y7F/N67Q HCA II is unique among the variants studied in having a direct, hydrogen-bonded chain of water molecules between the zinc-bound solvent and N(ε) of His64. This study provides the clearest example to date of the relevance of ordered water structure to rate constants for proton transfer in catalysis by carbonic anhydrase.</p>

<p>X-ray single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data from a crystal of proteinase K were collected using synchrotron radiation of 0.98 A wavelength at SER-CAT 22-ID beamline, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. At this wavelength, the expected Bijvoet ratio resulting from the presence of one calcium, one chloride and ten S atoms in the 279-residue protein is extremely small at approximately 0.46%. The direct-methods program SHELXD located 11 anomalous sites using data truncated to 2 A resolution. SHELXE was used to produce an easily interpretable electron-density map. This study shows that an accurate beamline and a good-quality crystal provide the possibility of successfully using a very weak anomalous signal of sulfur measured at a short wavelength for phasing a protein structure, even if a small degree of radiation damage is present.</p>

<p>One of the most striking features of several X-ray structures of CoA-independent ALDHs (aldehyde dehydrogenases) in complex with NAD(P) is the conformational flexibility of the NMN moiety. However, the fact that the rate of the acylation step is high in GAPN (non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) from Streptococcus mutans implies an optimal positioning of the nicotinamide ring relative to the hemithioacetal intermediate within the ternary GAPN complex to allow an efficient and stereospecific hydride transfer. Substitutions of serine for invariant Thr244 and alanine for Lys178 result in a drastic decrease of the efficiency of hydride transfer which becomes rate-limiting. The crystal structure of the binary complex T244S GAPN-NADP shows that the absence of the beta-methyl group leads to a well-defined conformation of the NMN part, including the nicotinamide ring, clearly different from that depicted to be suitable for an efficient hydride transfer in the wild-type. The approximately 0.6-unit increase in pK(app) of the catalytic Cys302 observed in the ternary complex for both mutated GAPNs is likely to be due to a slight difference in positioning of the nicotinamide ring relative to Cys302 with respect to the wild-type ternary complex. Taken together, the data support a critical role of the Thr244 beta-methyl group, held in position through a hydrogen-bond interaction between the Thr244 beta-hydroxy group and the epsilon-amino group of Lys178, in permitting the nicotinamide ring to adopt a conformation suitable for an efficient hydride transfer during the acylation step for all the members of the CoA-independent ALDH family.</p>

<p>Rhodococcal cocaine esterase (CocE) is an attractive potential treatment for both cocaine overdose and cocaine addiction. CocE directly degrades cocaine into inactive products, whereas traditional small-molecule approaches require blockade of the inhibitory action of cocaine on a diverse array of monoamine transporters and ion channels. The usefulness of wild-type (wt) cocaine esterase is hampered by its inactivation at 37 degrees C. Herein, we characterize the most thermostable form of this enzyme to date, CocE-L169K/G173Q. In vitro kinetic analyses reveal that CocE-L169K/G173Q displays a half-life of 2.9 days at 37 degrees C, which represents a 340-fold improvement over wt and is 15-fold greater than previously reported mutants. Crystallographic analyses of CocE-L169K/G173Q, determined at 1.6-A resolution, suggest that stabilization involves enhanced domain-domain interactions involving van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding. In vivo rodent studies reveal that intravenous pretreatment with CocE-L169K/G173Q in mice provides protection from cocaine-induced lethality for longer time periods before cocaine administration than wt CocE. Furthermore, intravenous administration (pretreatment) of CocE-L169K/G173Q prevents self-administration of cocaine in a time-dependent manner. Termination of the in vivo effects of CoCE seems to be dependent on, but not proportional to, its clearance from plasma as its half-life is approximately 2.3 h and similar to that of wt CocE (2.2 h). Taken together these data suggest that CocE-L169K/G173Q possesses many of the properties of a biological therapeutic for treating cocaine abuse but requires additional development to improve its serum half-life.</p>

<p>Glucokinase (GK) catalyses the formation of glucose 6-phosphate from glucose and ATP. A specific feature of GK amongst hexokinases is that it can cycle between active and inactive conformations as a function of glucose concentration, resulting in a unique positive kinetic cooperativity with glucose, which turns GK into a unique key sensor of glucose metabolism, notably in the pancreas. GK is a target of antidiabetic drugs aimed at the activation of GK activity, leading to insulin secretion. Here, the first structures of a GK-glucose complex without activator, of GK-glucose-AMP-PNP and of GK-glucose-AMP-PNP with a bound activator are reported. All these structures are extremely similar, thus demonstrating that binding of GK activators does not result in conformational changes of the active protein but in stabilization of the active form of GK.</p>

<p>The compound UIC-94017 (TMC-114) is a second-generation HIV protease inhibitor with improved pharmacokinetics that is chemically related to the clinical inhibitor amprenavir. UIC-94017 is a broad-spectrum potent inhibitor active against HIV-1 clinical isolates with minimal cytotoxicity. We have determined the high-resolution crystal structures of UIC-94017 in complexes with wild-type HIV-1 protease (PR) and mutant proteases PR(V82A) and PR(I84V) that are common in drug-resistant HIV. The structures were refined at resolutions of 1.10-1.53A. The crystal structures of PR and PR(I84V) with UIC-94017 ternary complexes show that the inhibitor binds to the protease in two overlapping positions, while the PR(V82A) complex had one ordered inhibitor. In all three structures, UIC-94017 forms hydrogen bonds with the conserved main-chain atoms of Asp29 and Asp30 of the protease. These interactions are proposed to be critical for the potency of this compound against HIV isolates that are resistant to multiple protease inhibitors. Other small differences were observed in the interactions of the mutants with UIC-94017 as compared to PR. PR(V82A) showed differences in the position of the main-chain atoms of residue 82 compared to PR structure that better accommodated the inhibitor. Finally, the 1.10A resolution structure of PR(V82A) with UIC-94017 showed an unusual distribution of electron density for the catalytic aspartate residues, which is discussed in relation to the reaction mechanism.</p>

<p>The high-resolution crystal structure of kexin (Kex2) in complex with a peptidyl-chloromethylketone inhibitor containing a noncognate lysine at the P(1) position provides the structural basis for the differential lysine/arginine selectivity that defines the prohormone (proprotein) convertase (PC) family. By comparison with the previous structures of Kex2 and furin, this structure of the acylated enzyme provides a basis for the observed decrease in the acylation rate with substrates containing a lysine at P(1) and the absence of an effect on the deacylation rate without involving mobility of the S(1) lid. The structure of the complex shows that a secondary subsite in the S(1) pocket is present, and that this site recognizes and binds the P(1) lysine in a more shallow fashion than arginine. This results in a displacement of the bound peptide away from the S385 nucleophile relative to substrates containing a P(1) arginine. It is concluded that this alternate binding site and resultant displacement of the scissile bond in the active site results in the observed decrease in the acylation rate. Studies of the inactivation kinetics of Kex2 by two peptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitors demonstrates that the selectivity between lysine and arginine at the P(1) position arises at the acylation step, consistent with what was observed with peptidyl substrates [Rockwell NC, Fuller RS (2001) J Biol Chem 276:38394-38399].</p>

<p>The glyoxalase pathway catalyzes the formation of d-lactate from methylglyoxal, a toxic byproduct of glycolysis. In trypanosomatids, trypanothione replaces glutathione in this pathway, making it a potential drug target, since its selective inhibition might increase methylglyoxal concentration in the parasites. Two glyoxalase II structures were solved. One with a bound spermidine molecule (1.8 A) and the other with d-lactate at the active site (1.9 A). The second structure was obtained by crystal soaking with the enzyme substrate (S)-d-lactoyltrypanothione. The overall structure of Leishmania infantum glyoxalase II is very similar to its human counterpart, with important differences at the substrate binding site. The crystal structure of L. infantum glyoxalase II is the first structure of this enzyme from trypanosomatids. The differential specificity of glyoxalase II toward glutathione and trypanothione moieties was revealed by differential substrate binding. Evolutionary analysis shows that trypanosomatid glyoxalases II diverged early from eukaryotic enzymes, being unrelated to prokaryotic proteins.</p>

<p>Ribose is transported into cells in its pyranose form and must be rearranged to its furanose form for further utilization. Ribose pyranase RbsD catalyzes the conversion of ribose from the pyranose to furanose form. This is the key step for substrate supply to ribokinase RbsK, which converts ribose to ribose-5-phosphate for further metabolism. Sequence analysis indicated Sa240 from Staphylococcus aureus was a ribose pyranase homolog. Here we showed that Sa240 formed dimeric structure both in solution and in crystal. S240-ribose complex structure showed a ribose binding site formed by an incomplete active site compared with RbsD. Because the catalytic activity of ribose pyranase depends on its oligomeric state, we propose Sa240 is catalytically inactive in its dimeric structure.</p>

<p>The 2.7 A structure of Candida albicans RNA guanylyltransferase Cgt1 cocrystallized with a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) peptide composed of four Ser5-PO4 YSPTSPS heptad repeats illuminates distinct CTD-docking sites localized to the Cgt1 N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase domain. Tyr1, Pro3, Pro6, and Ser5-PO4 side chains from each of two YSPTSPS repeats contribute to the interface. Comparison to the Pin1-CTD structure shows that the CTD can assume markedly different conformations that are templated by particular binding partners. Structural plasticity combined with remodeling of CTD primary structure by kinases and phosphatases provides a versatile mechanism by which the CTD can recruit structurally dissimilar proteins during transcription. A binding site for the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus was also uncovered within the Cgt1 OB domain.</p>

<p>Soluble adenylate cyclases catalyse the synthesis of the second messenger cAMP through the cyclisation of ATP and are the only known enzymes to be directly activated by bicarbonate. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the human enzyme that reveals a pseudosymmetrical arrangement of two catalytic domains to produce a single competent active site and a novel discrete bicarbonate binding pocket. Crystal structures of the apo protein, the protein in complex with α,β-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMPCPP) and calcium, with the allosteric activator bicarbonate, and also with a number of inhibitors identified using fragment screening, all show a flexible active site that undergoes significant conformational changes on binding of ligands. The resulting nanomolar-potent inhibitors that were developed bind at both the substrate binding pocket and the allosteric site, and can be used as chemical probes to further elucidate the function of this protein. </p>

<p>Plant Tau class glutathione transferases (GSTUs) detoxify diphenylether herbicides such as fluorodifen, determining their selectivity in crops and weeds. Using reconstructive PCR, a series of mutant GSTUs were generated from in vitro recombination and mutagenesis of the maize sequences ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2 (with the prefix Zm designating Zea mays L.). A screen of 5000 mutant GSTUs identified seven enzymes with enhanced fluorodifen detoxifying activity. The best performing enhanced fluorodifen detoxifying mutant (EFD) had activity 19-fold higher than the parent enzymes, with a single point mutation conferring this enhancement. Further mutagenesis of this residue generated an EFD with a 29-fold higher catalytic efficiency toward fluorodifen as compared with the parents but with unaltered catalysis toward other substrates. When expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, the optimized EFD, but not the parent enzymes, conferred enhanced tolerance to fluorodifen. Molecular modeling predicts that the serendipitous mutation giving the improvement in detoxification is due to the removal of an unfavorable interaction together with the introduction of a favorable change in conformation of residues 107-119, which contribute to herbicide binding.</p>

<p>Aromatic amides comprising branched aliphatic carboxylic acids and 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide were evaluated for their inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms. Of the most anticonvulsant-active compounds (2, 4, 13, 16, and 17), only 13, 16, and 17 were potent inhibitors of CAs VII and XIV. Compounds 9, 14, and 19 inhibited CA II, while 10 and 12 inhibited all isoforms. Structural studies suggest that differences in the active sites' hydrophobicity modulate the affinity of the inhibitors.</p>

<p>The modification of the nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin, by amidation presents a promising strategy for designing novel cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors. A series of alpha-substituted indomethacin ethanolamides, which exist as R/S-enantiomeric pairs, provides a means to study the impact of stereochemistry on COX inhibition. Comparative studies revealed that the R- and S-enantiomers of the alpha-substituted analogs inhibit COX-2 with almost equal efficacy, whereas COX-1 is selectively inhibited by the S-enantiomers. Mutagenesis studies have not been able to identify residues that manifest the enantioselectivity in COX-1. In an effort to understand the structural impact of chirality on COX-1 selectivity, the crystal structures of ovine COX-1 in complexes with an enantiomeric pair of these indomethacin ethanolamides were determined at resolutions between 2.75 and 2.85 A. These structures reveal unique, enantiomer-selective interactions within the COX-1 side pocket region that stabilize drug binding and account for the chiral selectivity observed with the (S)-alpha-substituted indomethacin ethanolamides. Kinetic analysis of binding demonstrates that both inhibitors bind quickly utilizing a two-step mechanism. However, the second binding step is readily reversible for the R-enantiomer, whereas for the S-enantiomer, it is not. These studies establish for the first time the structural and kinetic basis of high affinity binding of a neutral inhibitor to COX-1 and demonstrate that the side pocket of COX-1, previously thought to be sterically inaccessible, can serve as a binding pocket for inhibitor association.</p>

<p>Selective inhibitors against the 11 families of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are used to treat various human diseases. How the inhibitors selectively bind the conserved PDE catalytic domains is unknown. The crystal structures of the PDE4D2 catalytic domain in complex with (R)- or (R,S)-rolipram suggest that inhibitor selectivity is determined by the chemical nature of amino acids and subtle conformational changes of the binding pockets. The conformational states of Gln369 in PDE4D2 may play a key role in inhibitor recognition. The corresponding Y329S mutation in PDE7 may lead to loss of the hydrogen bonds between rolipram and Gln369 and is thus a possible reason explaining PDE7's insensitivity to rolipram inhibition. Docking of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil into the PDE4 catalytic pocket further helps understand inhibitor selectivity.</p>

<p>Damage to DNA involving excision of the nucleobase at the N-glycosidic bond forms abasic sites. If a nucleotide becomes incorporated opposite an unrepaired abasic site during DNA synthesis, most B family polymerases obey the A-rule and preferentially incorporate dAMP without instruction from the template. In addition to being potentially mutagenic, abasic sites provide strong blocks to DNA synthesis. A previous crystal structure of an exonuclease deficient variant of the replicative B family DNA polymerase from bacteriophage RB69 (RB69 gp43 exo-) illustrated these properties, showing that the polymerase failed to translocate the DNA following insertion of dAMP opposite an abasic site. We examine four new structures depicting several steps of translesion DNA synthesis by RB69 gp43 exo-, employing a non-natural purine triphosphate analogue, 5-nitro-1-indolyl-2'-deoxyriboside-5'-triphosphate (5-NITP), that is incorporated more efficiently than dAMP opposite abasic sites. Our structures indicate that a dipole-induced dipole stacking interaction between the 5-nitro group and base 3' to the templating lesion explains the enhanced kinetics of 5-NITP. As with dAMP, the DNA fails to translocate following insertion of 5-NIMP, although distortions at the nascent primer terminus contribute less than previously thought in inducing the stall, given that 5-NIMP preserves relatively undistorted geometry at the insertion site following phosphoryl transfer. An open ternary configuration, novel in B family polymerases, reveals an initial template independent binding of 5-NITP adjacent to the active site of the open polymerase, suggesting that closure of the fingers domain shuttles the nucleotide to the active site while testing the substrate against the template.</p>

<p>Cyclodextrins resist hydrolysis by burying all bridge oxygens at their interior. Still, the rings can be opened by a small group of specialized enzymes, the cyclomaltodextrinases. Among them, the enzyme from Flavobacterium sp. no. 92 was mutated, crystallized and soaked with cyclodextrins, giving rise to four complex structures. One of them showed an alpha-cyclodextrin at the outer rim of the active center pocket. In the other complexes, alpha-, beta-and gamma-cyclodextrins were bound in a competent mode in the active center. The structures suggest that Arg464 functions as a chaperone guiding the substrates from the solvent into the active center. Over the last part of this pathway, the cyclodextrins bump on Phe274, which rotates the glucosyl group at subsite (+1) by about 120 degrees and fixes it in the new conformation. This induced fit was observed with all three major cyclodextrins. It makes the bridging oxygen between subsites (+1) and (-1) available for protonation by Glu340, which starts the hydrolysis. The mechanism resembles a spring-lock. The structural data were supplemented by activity measurements, quantifying the initial ring opening reaction for the major cyclodextrins and the transglucosylation activity for maltotetraose. Further activity data were collected for mutants splitting the tetrameric enzyme into dimers and for active center mutants.</p>

<p>Primases are DNA-dependent RNA polymerases found in all cellular organisms. In bacteria, primer synthesis is carried out by DnaG, an essential enzyme that serves as a key component of DNA replication initiation, progression, and restart. How DnaG associates with nucleotide substrates and how certain naturally prevalent nucleotide analogs impair DnaG function are unknown. We have examined one of the earliest stages in primer synthesis and its control by solving crystal structures of the S. aureus DnaG catalytic core bound to metal ion cofactors and either individual nucleoside triphosphates or the nucleotidyl alarmones, pppGpp and ppGpp. These structures, together with both biochemical analyses and comparative studies of enzymes that use the same catalytic fold as DnaG, pinpoint the predominant nucleotide-binding site of DnaG and explain how the induction of the stringent response in bacteria interferes with primer synthesis.</p>

<p>HsaF and HsaG are an aldolase and dehydrogenase from the cholesterol degradation pathway of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. HsaF could be heterologously expressed and purified as a soluble dimer, but the enzyme was inactive in the absence of HsaG. HsaF catalyzes the aldol cleavage of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoacids to produce pyruvate and an aldehyde. The enzyme requires divalent metals for activity, with a preference for Mn(2+). The Km values for 4-hydroxy-2-oxoacids were about 20-fold lower than observed for the aldolase homologue, BphI from the polychlorinated biphenyl degradation pathway. Acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde were channeled directly to the dehydrogenase, HsaG, without export to the bulk solvent where they were transformed to acyl-CoA in an NAD(+) and coenzyme A dependent reaction. HsaG is able to utilize aldehydes up to five carbons in length as substrates, with similar catalytic efficiencies. The HsaF-HsaG complex was crystallized and its structure was determined to a resolution of 1.93 Å. Substitution of serine 41 in HsaG with isoleucine or aspartate resulted in about 35-fold increase in Km for CoA but only 4-fold increase in Km dephospho-CoA, suggesting that this residue interacts with the 3'-ribose phosphate of CoA. A second protein annotated as a 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoic acid aldolase in M. tuberculosis (MhpE, Rv3469c) was expressed and purified, but was found to lack aldolase activity. Instead this enzyme was found to possess oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity, consistent with the conservation (with the 4-hydroxy-2-oxoacid aldolases) of residues involved in pyruvate enolate stabilization. </p>

<p>A novel 2-thio-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrimidine-containing inhibitor of human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was identified by high-throughput screening (IC50=8.1 μM). Biochemical, surface plasmon resonance, and saturation transfer difference NMR experiments indicated that the compound specifically associated with human LDHA in a manner that required simultaneous binding of the NADH co-factor. Structural variation of the screening hit resulted in significant improvements in LDHA biochemical inhibition activity (best IC50=0.48 μM). A crystal structure of an optimized compound bound to human LDHA was obtained and explained many of the observed structure-activity relationships.</p>

<p>The variation in inhibitor specificity for five different amine inhibitors bound to CST, BT, and the cold-adapted AST has been studied by use of association constant measurements, structural analysis of high-resolution crystal structures, and the LIE method. Experimental data show that AST binds the 1BZA and 2BEA inhibitors 0.8 and 0.5 kcal/mole more strongly than BT. However, structural interactions and orientations of the inhibitors within the S1 site have been found to be virtually identical in the three enzymes studied. For example, the four water molecules in the inhibitor-free structures of AST and BT are channeled into similar positions in the S1 site, and the nitrogen atom(s) of the inhibitors are found in two cationic binding sites denoted Position1 and Position2. The hydrophobic binding contributions for all five inhibitors, estimated by the LIE calculations, are also in the same order (-2.1 +/- 0.2 kcal/mole) for all three enzymes. Our hypothesis is therefore that the observed variation in inhibitor binding arises from different electrostatic interactions originating from residues outside the S1 site. This is well illustrated by AST, in which Asp 150 and Glu 221B, despite some distance from the S1 binding site, lower the electrostatic potential of the S1 site and thus enhance substrate binding. Because the trends in the experimentally determined binding energies were reproduced by the LIE calculations after adding the contribution from long-range interactions, we find this method very suitable for rational studies of protein-substrate interactions.</p>

<p>UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM) is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the conversion of UDP-galactopyranose to UDP-galactofuranose, which is a central reaction in galactofuranose biosynthesis. Galactofuranose has never been found in humans but is an essential building block of the cell wall and extracellular matrix of many bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. The importance of UGM for the viability of many pathogens and its absence in humans make UGM a potential drug target. Here we report the first crystal structures and small-angle x-ray scattering data for UGM from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, the causative agent of aspergillosis. The structures reveal that Aspergillus UGM has several extra secondary and tertiary structural elements that are not found in bacterial UGMs yet are important for substrate recognition and oligomerization. Small-angle x-ray scattering data show that Aspergillus UGM forms a tetramer in solution, which is unprecedented for UGMs. The binding of UDP or the substrate induces profound conformational changes in the enzyme. Two loops on opposite sides of the active site move toward each other by over 10 Å to cover the substrate and create a closed active site. The degree of substrate-induced conformational change exceeds that of bacterial UGMs and is a direct consequence of the unique quaternary structure of Aspergillus UGM. Galactopyranose binds at the re face of the FAD isoalloxazine with the anomeric carbon atom poised for nucleophilic attack by the FAD N5 atom. The structural data provide new insight into substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism and thus will aid inhibitor design.</p>

Two loops on opposite sides of the active site move toward each other by over 10 Å to cover the substrate and create a closed active site. The degree of substrate-induced conformational change exceeds that of bacterial UGMs and is a direct consequence of the unique quaternary structure of Aspergillus UGM. Galactopyranose binds at the re face of the FAD isoalloxazine with the anomeric carbon atom poised for nucleophilic attack by the FAD N5 atom. The structural data provide new insight into substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism and thus will aid inhibitor design.</p>

<p>L-Histidinol dehydrogenase from Brucella suis (BsHDH) is an enzyme involved in the histidine biosynthesis pathway which is absent in mammals, thus representing a very interesting target for the development of anti-Brucella agents. In this paper we report the crystallographic structure of a mutated form of BsHDH both in its unbound form and in complex with a nanomolar inhibitor. These studies provide the first structural background for the rational design of potent HDH inhibitors, thus offering new hints for clinical applications.</p>

<p>Eukaryotic pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase type 1 (P5N-1) catalyzes dephosphorylation of pyrimidine 5'-mononucleotides. Deficiency of P5N-1 activity in red blood cells results in nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. The enzyme deficiency is either familial or can be acquired through lead poisoning. We present the crystal structure of mouse P5N-1 refined to 2.35 A resolution. The mouse P5N-1 has a 92% sequence identity to its human counterpart. The structure revealed that P5N-1 adopts a fold similar to enzymes of the haloacid dehydrogenase superfamily. The active site of this enzyme is structurally highly similar to those of phosphoserine phosphatases. We propose a catalytic mechanism for P5N-1 that is also similar to that of phosphoserine phosphatases and provide experimental evidence for the mechanism in the form of structures of several reaction cycle states, including: 1) P5N-1 with bound Mg(II) at 2.25 A, 2) phosphoenzyme intermediate analog at 2.30 A, 3) product-transition complex analog at 2.35 A, and 4) product complex at 2.1A resolution with phosphate bound in the active site. Furthermore the structure of Pb(II)-inhibited P5N-1 (at 2.35 A) revealed that Pb(II) binds within the active site in a way that compromises function of the cationic cavity, which is required for the recognition and binding of the phosphate group of nucleotides.</p>

<p>Genes encoding methanogenic methylamine methyltransferases all contain an in-frame amber (UAG) codon that is read through during translation. We have identified the UAG-encoded residue in a 1.55 angstrom resolution structure of the Methanosarcina barkeri monomethylamine methyltransferase (MtmB). This structure reveals a homohexamer comprised of individual subunits with a TIM barrel fold. The electron density for the UAG-encoded residue is distinct from any of the 21 natural amino acids. Instead it appears consistent with a lysine in amide-linkage to (4R,5R)-4-substituted-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. We suggest that this amino acid be named l-pyrrolysine.</p>

<p>The interactions of a transition state mimic anilinomethyl glucoimidazole (AmGlcIm), with a K(i) constant of 0.6 x 10(-)(9) M and a Gibbs free energy value of -53.5 kJ/mol, with a family GH3 beta-d-glucan glucohydrolase from barley have been analyzed crystallographically and by ab initio quantum mechanical modeling. AmGlcIm binds 3 times more tightly to the beta-d-glucan glucohydrolase than a previously investigated phenyl glucoimidazole. In the enzyme-AmGlcIm complex, an additional residue, Tyr253, and a water molecule positioned between subsites -1 and +1 are recruited for binding. Analyses of the two binary complexes reveal the following. (i) An intricate network exists in which hydrogen bonds between the enzyme's catalytic pocket residues Lys206, His207, Tyr253, Asp285, and Glu491 and the glucoimidazoles are shorter by 0.15-0.53 A, compared with distances of hydrogen bonds in the Michaelis complex. (ii) The "glucose" moiety of the glucoimidazoles adopts a (4)E conformation that is vital for the low-nanomolar binding. (iii) The N1 atoms of the glucoimidazoles are positioned nearly optimally for in-line protonation by the Oepsilon1 atom of the catalytic acid/base Glu491. (iv) The enzyme derives binding energies from both glycone and aglycone components of the glucoimidazoles. (iv) The prevalent libration motion of the two domains of the enzyme could play a significant role during induced fit closure in the active site. (v) Modeling based on the structural data predicts that protons could be positioned on the N1 atoms of the glucoimidazoles, and the catalytic acid/base Glu491 could carry an overall negative charge. (vi) The enzyme-AmGlcIm complex reveals the likely structure of an early transition state during hydrolysis. Finally, the high-resolution structures enabled us to define minimal structures of oligosaccharides attached to Asn221, Asn498, and Asn600 N-glycosylation sites.</p>

<p>In eukaryotes, misfolded proteins must be distinguished from correctly folded proteins during folding and transport processes by quality control systems. Yeast peptide:N-glycanase (yPNGase) specifically deglycosylates the denatured form of N-linked glycoproteins in the cytoplasm and assists proteasome-mediated glycoprotein degradation by forming a complex with 26S proteasome through DNA repair protein, yRad23. Here, we describe the crystal structures of a yPNGase and XPC-binding domain of yRad23 (yRad23XBD, residues 238-309) complex and of a yPNGase-yRad23XBD complex bound to a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk. yPNGase is formed with three domains, a core domain containing a Cys-His-Asp triad, a Zn-binding domain, and a Rad23-binding domain. Both N- and C-terminal helices of yPNGase interact with yRad23 through extensive hydrophobic interactions. The active site of yPNGase is located in a deep cleft that is formed with residues conserved in all PNGase members, and three sugar molecules are bound to this cleft. Complex structures in conjunction with mutational analyses revealed that the walls of the cleft block access to the active site of yPNGase by native glycoprotein, whereas the cleft is sufficiently wide to accommodate denatured glycoprotein, thus explaining the specificity of PNGase for denatured substrates.</p>

<p>X-ray structures of aspartate transcarbamoylase in the absence and presence of the first substrate carbamoyl phosphate are reported. These two structures in conjunction with in silico docking experiments provide snapshots of critical events in the function of the enzyme. The ordered substrate binding, observed experimentally, can now be structurally explained by a conformational change induced upon the binding of carbamoyl phosphate. This induced fit dramatically alters the electrostatics of the active site, creating a binding pocket for aspartate. Upon aspartate binding, a further change in electrostatics causes a second induced fit, the domain closure. This domain closure acts as a clamp that both facilitates catalysis by approximation and also initiates the global conformational change that manifests homotropic cooperativity.</p>

<p>Osteoclasts, bone-resorptive multinucleated cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells, are associated with many bone-related diseases, such as osteoporosis. Osteoclast-targeting small-molecule inhibitors are valuable tools for studying osteoclast biology and for developing antiresorptive agents. Here, we have discovered that methyl-gerfelin (M-GFN), the methyl ester of the natural product gerfelin, suppresses osteoclastogenesis. By using M-GFN-immobilized beads, glyoxalase I (GLO1) was identified as an M-GFN-binding protein. GLO1 knockdown and treatment with an established GLO1 inhibitor in osteoclast progenitor cells interfered with osteoclast generation, suggesting that GLO1 activity is required for osteoclastogenesis. In cells, GLO1 plays a critical role in the detoxification of 2-oxoaldehydes, such as methylglyoxal. M-GFN inhibited the enzymatic activity of GLO1 in vitro and in situ. Furthermore, the cocrystal structure of the GLO1/M-GFN complex revealed the binding mode of M-GFN at the active site of GLO1. These results suggest that M-GFN targets GLO1, resulting in the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.</p>

<p>AzoR is an FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase isolated from Escherichia coli as a protein responsible for the degradation of azo compounds. We previously reported the crystal structure of the enzyme in the oxidized form. In the present study, different structures of AzoR were determined under several conditions to obtain clues to the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. AzoR in its reduced form revealed a twisted butterfly bend of the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN cofactor and a rearrangement of solvent molecules. The crystal structure of oxidized AzoR in a different space group and the structure of the enzyme in complex with the inhibitor dicoumarol were also determined. These structures indicate that the formation of a hydrophobic part around the isoalloxazine ring is important for substrate binding and an electrostatic interaction between Arg-59 and the carboxyl group of the azo compound causes a substrate preference for methyl red over p-methyl red. The substitution of Arg-59 with Ala enhanced the Vmax value for p-methyl red 27-fold with a 3.8-fold increase of the Km value. This result indicates that Arg-59 decides the substrate specificity of AzoR. The Vmax value for the p-methyl red reduction of the R59A mutant is comparable with that for the methyl red reduction of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the activity toward methyl red was retained. These findings indicate the expansion of AzoR substrate specificity by a single amino acid substitution. Furthermore, we built an authentic model of the AzoR-methyl red complex based on the results of the study.</p>

<p>Cytochrome P450cam is a heme-containing enzyme which catalyzes hydroxylation of d-camphor. The heme is bound in the heme pocket via noncovalent interactions, where two heme-propionate side chains interact with Arg, His, and/or Asp residues. To understand the role of the heme-7-propionate side chain, we prepared reconstituted P450cam with an artificial one-legged heme which has a methyl group at the position of the 7-propionate. Removal of 7-propionate dramatically decreases the d-camphor affinity by 3 orders of magnitude relative to that of the wild-type enzyme, and spectroscopic data indicate that 74% of the ferric P450cam exhibits a low-spin state owing to water molecule occupancy in the substrate-binding site under the normal assay conditions. Thus, the monooxygenase activity of the reconstituted protein is remarkably low due to the decrease in the rate of the first electron transfer from reduced putidaredoxin, whereas 87% of oxidized NADH was utilized to produce 5-hydroxy-d-camphor without any significant uncoupling reactions. X-ray structural analysis of the reconstituted enzyme reveals a novel water array extending from the substrate-binding site to bulk solvent through the position occupied by 7-propionate. This water array appears without causing any major changes in the protein structure with the notable exception of conformational changes occurring at Asp297 and Gln322 residues. We propose that the 7-propionate forms a barrier against entry of bulk water molecules and therefore in combination with Asp297, Arg299, and Gln322 plays an essential role in the process of elimination of the substrate-binding site water cluster which occurs upon d-camphor binding.</p>

<p>The atomic resolution structure of Leishmania mexicana triosephosphate isomerase complexed with 2-phosphoglycolate shows that this transition state analogue is bound in two conformations. Also for the side chain of the catalytic glutamate, Glu(167), two conformations are observed. In both conformations, a very short hydrogen bond exists between the carboxylate group of the ligand and the catalytic glutamate. The distance between O11 of PGA and Oepsilon2 of Glu(167) is 2.61 and 2.55 A for the major and minor conformations, respectively. In either conformation, Oepsilon1 of Glu(167) is hydrogen-bonded to a water network connecting the side chain with bulk solvent. This network also occurs in two mutually exclusive arrangements. Despite the structural disorder in the active site, the C termini of the beta strands that construct the active site display the least anisotropy compared with the rest of the protein. The loops following these beta strands display various degrees of anisotropy, with the tip of the dimer interface loop 3 having very low anisotropy and the C-terminal region of the active site loop 6 having the highest anisotropy. The pyrrolidine ring of Pro(168) at the N-terminal region of loop 6 is in a strained planar conformation to facilitate loop opening and product release.</p>

<p>Water is ubiquitously present in any biological system and has therefore to be regarded as an additional binding partner in the protein-ligand binding process. Upon complex formation, a new solvent-exposed surface is generated and water molecules from the first solvation layer will arrange around this newly formed surface. So far, the influence of such water arrangements on the ligand binding properties is unknown. In this study, the binding modes of nine congeneric phosphonamidate-type inhibitors with systematically varied, size-increasing hydrophobic P2 ' substituents (from methyl to phenylethyl) addressing the hydrophobic, solvent-exposed S2 ' pocket of thermolysin were analyzed by high-resolution crystal structures and correlated with their thermodynamic binding profiles as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Overall, ΔΔG spreads over 7.0 kJ mol(-1) , ΔΔH varies by 15.8 kJ mol(-1) , and -TΔΔS by 12.1 kJ mol(-1) . Throughout the series, these changes correlate remarkably well with the geometric differences of water molecules arranged adjacent to the P2 ' substituents. Ligands with medium-sized P2 ' substituents exhibit highest affinities, presumably because of their optimal solvation patterns around these complexes. The addition, removal, or rearrangement of even a single methyl group can result in a strong modulation of the adjacent water network pattern shifting from enthalpy to entropy-driven binding. In conclusion, the quality of a water network assembled around a protein-ligand complex influences the enthalpy/entropy signature and can even modulate affinity to a surprising extent. </p>

<p>The determination of protein crystal structures is hampered by the need for macroscopic crystals. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) provide extremely intense pulses of femtosecond duration, which allow data collection from nanometre- to micrometre-sized crystals in a 'diffraction-before-destruction' approach. So far, all protein structure determinations carried out using FELs have been based on previous knowledge of related, known structures. Here we show that X-ray FEL data can be used for de novo protein structure determination, that is, without previous knowledge about the structure. Using the emerging technique of serial femtosecond crystallography, we performed single-wavelength anomalous scattering measurements on microcrystals of the well-established model system lysozyme, in complex with a lanthanide compound. Using Monte-Carlo integration, we obtained high-quality diffraction intensities from which experimental phases could be determined, resulting in an experimental electron density map good enough for automated building of the protein structure. This demonstrates the feasibility of determining novel protein structures using FELs. We anticipate that serial femtosecond crystallography will become an important tool for the structure determination of proteins that are difficult to crystallize, such as membrane proteins. </p>

<p>The peripheral anionic site on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), located at the active center gorge entry, encompasses overlapping binding sites for allosteric activators and inhibitors; yet, the molecular mechanisms coupling this site to the active center at the gorge base to modulate catalysis remain unclear. The peripheral site has also been proposed to be involved in heterologous protein associations occurring during synaptogenesis or upon neurodegeneration. A novel crystal form of mouse AChE, combined with spectrophotometric analyses of the crystals, enabled us to solve unique structures of AChE with a free peripheral site, and as three complexes with peripheral site inhibitors: the phenylphenanthridinium ligands, decidium and propidium, and the pyrogallol ligand, gallamine, at 2.20-2.35 A resolution. Comparison with structures of AChE complexes with the peptide fasciculin or with organic bifunctional inhibitors unveils new structural determinants contributing to ligand interactions at the peripheral site, and permits a detailed topographic delineation of this site. Hence, these structures provide templates for designing compounds directed to the enzyme surface that modulate specific surface interactions controlling catalytic activity and non-catalytic heterologous protein associations.</p>

<p>The class II chelatases associated with heme, siroheme, and cobalamin biosynthesis are structurally related enzymes that insert a specific metal ion (Fe(2+) or Co(2+)) into the center of a modified tetrapyrrole (protoporphyrin or sirohydrochlorin). The structures of two related class II enzymes, CbiX(S) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus and CbiK from Salmonella enterica, that are responsible for the insertion of cobalt along the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway are presented in complex with their metallated product. A further structure of a CbiK from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough reveals how cobalt is bound at the active site. The crystal structures show that the binding of sirohydrochlorin is distinctly different to porphyrin binding in the protoporphyrin ferrochelatases and provide a molecular overview of the mechanism of chelation. The structures also give insights into the evolution of chelatase form and function. Finally, the structure of a periplasmic form of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough CbiK reveals a novel tetrameric arrangement of its subunits that are stabilized by the presence of a heme b cofactor. Whereas retaining colbaltochelatase activity, this protein has acquired a central cavity with the potential to chaperone or transport metals across the periplasmic space, thereby evolving a new use for an ancient protein subunit.</p>

<p>The inhibition of hH-PGDS has been proposed as a potential target for the development of anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory drugs. Herein we describe our investigation of the binding pocket of this important enzyme and our observation that two water molecules bind to our inhibitors and the enzyme. A series of compounds were prepared to the probe the importance of the water molecules in determining the binding affinity of the inhibitors to the enzyme. The study provides insight into the binding requirements for the design of potent hH-PGDS inhibitors.</p>

<p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) devotes a significant portion of its genome to producing nonstructural proteins required for viral replication. SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) was identified as an essential protein with RNA/DNA-binding activity, and yet its biological function within the replication complex remains unknown. Nsp9 forms a dimer through the interaction of parallel alpha-helices containing the protein-protein interaction motif GXXXG. In order to study the role of the nsp9 dimer in viral reproduction, residues G100 and G104 at the helix interface were targeted for mutation. Multi-angle light scattering measurements indicated that G100E, G104E, and G104V mutants are monomeric in solution, thereby disrupting the dimer. However, electrophoretic mobility assays revealed that the mutants bound RNA with similar affinity. Further experiments using fluorescence anisotropy showed a 10-fold reduction in RNA binding in the G100E and G104E mutants, whereas the G104V mutant had only a 4-fold reduction. The structure of G104E nsp9 was determined to 2.6-A resolution, revealing significant changes at the dimer interface. The nsp9 mutations were introduced into SARS-CoV using a reverse genetics approach, and the G100E and G104E mutations were found to be lethal to the virus. The G104V mutant produced highly debilitated virus and eventually reverted back to the wild-type protein sequence through a codon transversion. Together, these data indicate that dimerization of SARS-CoV nsp9 at the GXXXG motif is not critical for RNA binding but is necessary for viral replication.</p>

<p>Prostaglandin D(2) synthesised by the hematopoietic prostaglandin D(2) synthase has a pro-inflammatory effect in allergic asthma, regulating many hallmark characteristics of the disease. Here we describe identification of hematopoietic prostaglandin D(2) synthase inhibitors including cibacron blue, bromosulfophthalein and ethacrynic acid. Expansion around the drug-like ethacrynic acid identified a novel inhibitor, nocodazole, and a fragment representing its aromatic core. Nocodazole binding was further characterised by docking calculations in combination with conformational strain analysis. The benzyl thiophene core was predicted to be buried in the active site, binding in the putative prostaglandin binding site, and a likely hydrogen bond donor site identified. X-ray crystallographic studies supported the predicted binding mode.</p>

<p>Shikimate kinase (SK) and other enzymes in the shikimate pathway are potential targets for developing nontoxic antimicrobial agents, herbicides, and antiparasite drugs, because the pathway is essential in microorganisms, plants, and parasites but absent from mammals. SK catalyzes the reaction of phosphoryl transfer from ATP to shikimic acid (SA). Since 2002, a total of 11 SK structures have been reported, but none contains either the two substrate (SA and ATP) or the two product (SA-phosphate and ADP) molecules. Here, we present three crystal structures of SK from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtSK), including apo-MtSK, a binary complex MtSK x SA, and the ternary complex of MtSK with SA and an ATP analogue, AMPPCP. The structures of apo-MtSK and MtSK x AMPPCP x SA make it possible to elucidate the conformational changes of MtSK upon the binding of both substrates; the structure of MtSK x AMPPCP x SA reveals interactions between the protein and gamma-phosphate which indicate dynamic roles of catalytic residues Lys15 and Arg117.</p>

<p>Protein O-fucosylation is an essential post-translational modification, involved in the folding of target proteins and in the role of these target proteins during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, among other things. Two different enzymes are responsible for this modification, Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 and 2 (POFUT1 and POFUT2, respectively). Both proteins have been characterised biologically and enzymatically but nothing is known at the molecular or structural level. Here we describe the first crystal structure of a catalytically functional POFUT1 in an apo-form and in complex with GDP-fucose and GDP. The enzyme belongs to the GT-B family and is not dependent on manganese for activity. GDP-fucose/GDP is localised in a conserved cavity connected to a large solvent exposed pocket, which we show is the binding site of epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats in the extracellular domain of the Notch Receptor. Through both mutational and kinetic studies we have identified which residues are involved in binding and catalysis and have determined that the Arg240 residue is a key catalytic residue. We also propose a novel S(N)1-like catalytic mechanism with formation of an intimate ion pair, in which the glycosidic bond is cleaved before the nucleophilic attack; and theoretical calculations at a DFT (B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) support this mechanism. Thus, the crystal structure together with our mutagenesis studies explain the molecular mechanism of POFUT1 and provide a new starting point for the design of functional inhibitors to this critical enzyme in the future.</p>

<p>The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-binding protein (E3BP) and the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) component enzyme form the structural core of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by providing the binding sites for two other component proteins, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases and phosphatases. Despite a high similarity between the primary structures of E3BP and E2, the E3-binding domain of human E3BP is highly specific to human E3, whereas the E1-binding domain of human E2 is highly specific to human E1. In this study, we characterized binding of human E3 to the E3-binding domain of E3BP by x-ray crystallography at 2.6-angstroms resolution, and we used this structural information to interpret the specificity for selective binding. Two subunits of E3 form a single recognition site for the E3-binding domain of E3BP through their hydrophobic interface. The hydrophobic residues Pro133, Pro154, and Ile157 in the E3-binding domain of E3BP insert themselves into the surface of both E3 polypeptide chains. Numerous ionic and hydrogen bonds between the residues of three interacting polypeptide chains adjacent to the central hydrophobic patch add to the stability of the subcomplex. The specificity of pairing for human E3BP with E3 is interpreted from its subcomplex structure to be most likely due to conformational rigidity of the binding fragment of the E3-binding domain of E3BP and its exquisite amino acid match with the E3 target interface.</p>

<p>Type II topoisomerases are required for the management of DNA tangles and supercoils, and are targets of clinical antibiotics and anti-cancer agents. These enzymes catalyse the ATP-dependent passage of one DNA duplex (the transport or T-segment) through a transient, double-stranded break in another (the gate or G-segment), navigating DNA through the protein using a set of dissociable internal interfaces, or 'gates'. For more than 20 years, it has been established that a pair of dimer-related tyrosines, together with divalent cations, catalyse G-segment cleavage. Recent efforts have proposed that strand scission relies on a 'two-metal mechanism', a ubiquitous biochemical strategy that supports vital cellular processes ranging from DNA synthesis to RNA self-splicing. Here we present the structure of the DNA-binding and cleavage core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II covalently linked to DNA through its active-site tyrosine at 2.5A resolution, revealing for the first time the organization of a cleavage-competent type II topoisomerase configuration. Unexpectedly, metal-soaking experiments indicate that cleavage is catalysed by a novel variation of the classic two-metal approach. Comparative analyses extend this scheme to explain how distantly-related type IA topoisomerases cleave single-stranded DNA, unifying the cleavage mechanisms for these two essential enzyme families. The structure also highlights a hitherto undiscovered allosteric relay that actuates a molecular 'trapdoor' to prevent subunit dissociation during cleavage. This connection illustrates how an indispensable chromosome-disentangling machine auto-regulates DNA breakage to prevent the aberrant formation of mutagenic and cytotoxic genomic lesions.</p>

<p>Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are a ubiquitous family of proteins that reduce disulfide bonds in substrate proteins using electrons from reduced glutathione (GSH). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Grx6 is a monothiol Grx that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments. Grx6 consists of three segments, a putative signal peptide (M1-I36), an N-terminal domain (K37-T110), and a C-terminal Grx domain (K111-N231, designated Grx6C). Compared to the classic dithiol glutaredoxin Grx1, Grx6 has a lower glutathione disulfide reductase activity but a higher glutathione S-transferase activity. In addition, similar to human Grx2, Grx6 binds GSH via an iron-sulfur cluster in vitro. The N-terminal domain is essential for noncovalent dimerization, but not required for either of the above activities. The crystal structure of Grx6C at 1.5 A resolution revealed a novel two-strand antiparallel beta-sheet opposite the GSH binding groove. This extra beta-sheet might also exist in yeast Grx7 and in a group of putative Grxs in lower organisms, suggesting that Grx6 might represent the first member of a novel Grx subfamily.</p>

<p>The binding of substrates to heme enzymes has been widely assumed to occur at the so-called delta-heme edge. Recently, however, a number of examples have appeared in which substrate binding at an alternative site, the gamma-heme edge, is also possible. In previous work [Sharp et al. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 303-307], we showed that binding of ascorbate to ascorbate peroxidase occurred at the gamma-heme edge. Here, we show that the closely related cytochrome c peroxidase enzyme can duplicate the substrate binding properties of ascorbate peroxidase through the introduction of relatively modest structural changes at Tyr36 and Asn184. Hence, crystallographic data for the Y36A/N184R/W191F triple variant of cytochrome c peroxidase shows ascorbate bound to the gamma-heme edge, with hydrogen bonds to the heme propionate and Arg184. In parallel mechanistic studies in variants incorporating the W191F mutation, we show that a transient porphyrin pi-cation radical in Compound I of cytochrome c peroxidase, analogous to that observed in ascorbate peroxidase, is competent for ascorbate oxidation but that under steady state conditions this intermediate decays too rapidly to sustain efficient turnover of ascorbate. The results are discussed in terms of our more general understanding of substrate oxidation across other heme proteins, and the emerging role of the heme propionates at the gamma-heme edge.</p>

<p>Non homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair of DNA double-strand breaks in prokaryotes requires Ku and a specific multidomain DNA ligase (LigD). We present crystal structures of the primase/polymerisation domain (PolDom) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis LigD, alone and complexed with nucleotides. The PolDom structure combines the general fold of the archaeo-eukaryotic primase (AEP) superfamily with additional loops and domains that together form a deep cleft on the surface, likely used for DNA binding. Enzymatic analysis indicates that the PolDom of LigD, even in the absence of accessory domains and Ku proteins, has the potential to recognise DNA end-joining intermediates. Strikingly, one of the main signals for the specific and efficient binding of PolDom to DNA is the presence of a 5'-phosphate group, located at the single/double-stranded junction at both gapped and 3'-protruding DNA molecules. Although structurally unrelated, Pol lambda and Pol mu, the two eukaryotic DNA polymerases involved in NHEJ, are endowed with a similar capacity to bind a 5'-phosphate group. Other properties that are beneficial for NHEJ, such as the ability to generate template distortions and realignments of the primer, displayed by Pol lambda and Pol mu, are shared by the PolDom of bacterial LigD. In addition, PolDom can perform non-mutagenic translesion synthesis on termini containing modified bases. Significantly, ribonucleotide insertion appears to be a recurrent theme associated with NHEJ, maximised in this case by the deployment of a dedicated primase, although its in vivo relevance is unknown.</p>

<p>The double helix of DNA, when composed of dinucleotide purine-pyrimidine repeats, can adopt a left-handed helical structure called Z-DNA. For reasons not entirely understood, such dinucleotide repeats in genomic sequences have been associated with genomic instability leading to cancer. Adoption of the left-handed conformation results in the formation of conformational junctions: A B-to-Z junction is formed at the boundaries of the helix, whereas a Z-to-Z junction is commonly formed in sequences where the dinucleotide repeat is interrupted by single base insertions or deletions that bring neighboring helices out of phase. B-Z junctions are shown to result in exposed nucleotides vulnerable to chemical or enzymatic modification. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of a Z-Z junction stabilized by Zalpha, the Z-DNA binding domain of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. We show that the junction structure consists of a single base pair and leads to partial or full disruption of the helical stacking. The junction region allows intercalating agents to insert themselves into the left-handed helix, which is otherwise resistant to intercalation. However, unlike a B-Z junction, in this structure the bases are not fully extruded, and the stacking between the two left-handed helices is not continuous.</p>

<p>Human topoisomerase I relaxes superhelical tension associated with DNA replication, transcription and recombination by reversibly nicking one strand of duplex DNA and forming a covalent 3'-phosphotyrosine linkage. This enzyme is the sole target of the camptothecin family of anticancer compounds, which acts by stabilizing the covalent protein-DNA complex and enhancing apoptosis through blocking the advancement of replication forks. Mutations that impart resistance to camptothecin have been identified in several regions of human topoisomerase I. We present the crystal structures of two camptothecin-resistant forms of human topoisomerase I (Phe361Ser at 2.6A resolution and Asn722Ser at 2.3A resolution) in ternary complexes with DNA and topotecan (Hycamtin), a camptothecin analogue currently in widespread clinical use. While the alteration of Asn722 to Ser leads to the elimination of a water-mediated contact between the enzyme and topotecan, we were surprised to find that a well-ordered water molecule replaces the hydrophobic phenylalanine side-chain in the Phe361Ser structure. We further consider camptothecin-resistant mutations at seven additional sites in human topoisomerase I and present structural evidence explaining their possible impact on drug binding. These results advance our understanding of the mechanism of cell poisoning by camptothecin and suggest specific modifications to the drug that may improve efficacy.</p>

<p>Escherichia coli glycogen synthase (EcGS, EC 2.4.1.21) is a retaining glycosyltransferase (GT) that transfers glucose from adenosine diphosphate glucose to a glucan chain acceptor with retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon. EcGS belongs to the GT-B structural superfamily. Here we report several EcGS x-ray structures that together shed considerable light on the structure and function of these enzymes. The structure of the wild-type enzyme bound to ADP and glucose revealed a 15.2 degrees overall domain-domain closure and provided for the first time the structure of the catalytically active, closed conformation of a glycogen synthase. The main chain carbonyl group of His-161, Arg-300, and Lys-305 are suggested by the structure to act as critical catalytic residues in the transglycosylation. Glu-377, previously thought to be catalytic is found on the alpha-face of the glucose and plays an electrostatic role in the active site and as a glucose ring locator. This is also consistent with the structure of the EcGS(E377A)-ADP-HEPPSO complex where the glucose moiety is either absent or disordered in the active site.</p>

<p>Activity of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase APH(3')-Ia leads to resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, and contributes to the clinical obsolescence of this class of antibiotics. One strategy to rescue compromised antibiotics such as aminoglycosides is targeting the enzymes that confer resistance with small molecules. We demonstrated previously that ePK (eukaryotic protein kinase) inhibitors could inhibit APH enzymes, owing to the structural similarity between these two enzyme families. However, limited structural information of enzyme-inhibitor complexes hindered interpretation of the results. In addition, cross-reactivity of compounds between APHs and ePKs represents an obstacle to their use as aminoglycoside adjuvants to rescue aminoglycoside antibiotic activity. In the present study, we structurally and functionally characterize inhibition of APH(3')-Ia by three diverse chemical scaffolds, anthrapyrazolone, 4-anilinoquinazoline and PP (pyrazolopyrimidine), and reveal distinctions in the binding mode of anthrapyrazolone and PP compounds to APH(3')-Ia compared with ePKs. Using this observation, we identify PP derivatives that select against ePKs, attenuate APH(3')-Ia activity and rescue aminoglycoside antibiotic activity against a resistant Escherichia coli strain. The structures described in the present paper and the inhibition studies provide an important opportunity for structure-based design of compounds to target aminoglycoside phosphotransferases for inhibition, potentially overcoming this form of antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p>L-Histidinol phosphate phosphatase (HPP) catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-histidinol phosphate to L-histidinol and inorganic phosphate, the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of L-histidine. HPP from the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) family of proteins possesses a trinuclear active site and a distorted (β/α)(7)-barrel protein fold. This group of enzymes is closely related to the amidohydrolase superfamily of enzymes. The mechanism of phosphomonoester bond hydrolysis by the PHP family of HPP enzymes was addressed. Recombinant HPP from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis that was expressed in Escherichia coli contained a mixture of iron and zinc in the active site and had a catalytic efficiency of ~10(3) M(-1) s(-1). Expression of the protein under iron-free conditions resulted in the production of an enzyme with a 2 order of magnitude improvement in catalytic efficiency and a mixture of zinc and manganese in the active site. Solvent isotope and viscosity effects demonstrated that proton transfer steps and product dissociation steps are not rate-limiting. X-ray structures of HPP were determined with sulfate, L-histidinol phosphate, and a complex of L-histidinol and arsenate bound in the active site. These crystal structures and the catalytic properties of variants were used to identify the structural elements required for catalysis and substrate recognition by the HPP family of enzymes within the amidohydrolase superfamily.</p>

<p>Tankyrases are ADP-ribosyltransferases that play key roles in various cellular pathways, including the regulation of cell proliferation, and thus, they are promising drug targets for the treatment of cancer. Flavones have been shown to inhibit tankyrases and we report here the discovery of more potent and selective flavone derivatives. Commercially available flavones with single substitutions were used for structure-activity relationship studies, and cocrystal structures of the 18 hit compounds were analyzed to explain their potency and selectivity. The most potent inhibitors were also tested in a cell-based assay, which demonstrated that they effectively antagonize Wnt signaling. To assess selectivity, they were further tested against a panel of homologous human ADP-ribosyltransferases. The most effective compound, 22 (MN-64), showed 6 nM potency against tankyrase 1, isoenzyme selectivity, and Wnt signaling inhibition. This work forms a basis for rational development of flavones as tankyrase inhibitors and guides the development of other structurally related inhibitors. </p>

To our knowledge, these are the first reported X-ray structures of TACE with a hydantoin zinc ligand.</p>

<p>The generation of modified amino acid precursors for incorporation in nonribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS) plays a crucial, if often understated, role in the generation of peptide natural products. The biosynthesis of the cyclic depsipeptide skyllamycin requires three β-hydroxylated amino acid precursors, with in vivo gene inactivation experiments implicating cytochrome P450sky (CYP163B3) in the hydroxylation of these amino acids. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro oxidation of l-amino acid substrates bound to peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains 5, 7, and 11 of the skyllamycin nonribosomal synthetase by P450sky. Selectivity for these domains over other PCP domains could be demonstrated, with hydroxylation selective for l-amino acids and stereospecific in nature resulting in the (2S,3S)-configuration. The oxidation of amino acids or small molecule substrate analogues was not supported, demonstrating the necessity of the carrier protein in P450sky-catalyzed hydroxylation. The binding of aminoacyl-PCP substrates to P450sky was detected for the catalytically active PCP7 but not for the catalytically inactive PCP10, indicating carrier protein-mediated selectivity in P450sky substrate binding. X-ray crystal structures of P450sky reveal a 3D-structure with a highly open active site, the size of which is dictated by the carrier protein bound nature of the substrate. P450sky is the first P450 demonstrated to not only interact directly with PCP-bound amino acids within the peptide-forming NRPS but also to do so with three different PCP domains in a specific fashion. This represents an expansion of the complexity and scope of NRPS-mediated peptide synthesis, with the generation of hydroxylated amino acid precursors occurring through the interaction of P450 enzymes following, rather than prior to, the selection of amino acids by NRPS-adenylation domains. </p>

<p>Although commercialized inhibitors of active site serine beta-lactamases are currently used in coadministration with antibiotic therapy, no clinically useful inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) have yet been discovered. In this paper, we investigated the inhibitory effect of mercaptophosphonate derivatives against the three subclasses of MBLs (B1, B2, and B3). All 14 tested mercaptophosphonates, with the exception of 1a, behaved as competitive inhibitors for the three subclasses. Apart from 13 and 21, all the mercaptophosphonates tested exhibit a good inhibitory effect on the subclass B2 MBL CphA with low inhibition constants (K(i) &lt; 15 muM). Interestingly, compound 18 turned out to be a potent broad spectrum MBL inhibitor. The crystallographic structures of the CphA-10a and CphA-18 complexes indicated that the sulfur atom of 10a and the phosphonato group of 18 interact with the Zn(2+) ion, respectively. Molecular modeling studies of the interactions between compounds 10a and 18 and the VIM-4 (B1), CphA (B2), and FEZ-1 (B3) enzymes brought to light different binding modes depending on the enzyme and the inhibitor, consistent with the crystallographic structures.</p>

<p>Cocaine is considered to be the most addictive of all substances of abuse and mediates its effects by inhibiting monoamine transporters, primarily the dopamine transporters. There are currently no small molecules that can be used to combat its toxic and addictive properties, in part because of the difficulty of developing compounds that inhibit cocaine binding without having intrinsic effects on dopamine transport. Most of the effective cocaine inhibitors also display addictive properties. We have recently reported the use of cocaine esterase (CocE) to accelerate the removal of systemic cocaine and to prevent cocaine-induced lethality. However, wild-type CocE is relatively unstable at physiological temperatures (tau(1/2) approximately 13 min at 37 degrees C), presenting challenges for its development as a viable therapeutic agent. We applied computational approaches to predict mutations to stabilize CocE and showed that several of these have increased stability both in vitro and in vivo, with the most efficacious mutant (T172R/G173Q) extending half-life up to 370 min. Here we present novel X-ray crystallographic data on these mutants that provide a plausible model for the observed enhanced stability. We also more extensively characterize the previously reported variants and report on a new stabilizing mutant, L169K. The improved stability of these engineered CocE enzymes will have a profound influence on the use of this protein to combat cocaine-induced toxicity and addiction in humans.</p>

<p>Here we describe the crystal structures of the NAD kinase (LmNADK1) from Listeria monocytogenes in complex with its substrate NAD, its product NADP, or two synthesized NAD mimics. We identified one of the NAD mimics, di-adenosine diphosphate, as a new substrate for LmNADK1, whereas we showed that the closely related compound di-5'-thioadenosine is a novel non-natural inhibitor for this enzyme. These structures suggest a mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis. Indeed, sequence/structure comparison and directed mutagenesis have previously shown that NAD kinases (NADKs) and the distantly related 6-phosphofructokinases share the same catalytically important GGDGT motif. However, in this study we have shown that these enzymes use the central aspartate of this motif differently. Although this acidic residue chelates the catalytic Mg(2+) ion in 6-phosphofructokinases, it activates the phospho-acceptor (NAD) in NADKs. Sequence/structure comparisons suggest that the role of this aspartate would be conserved in NADKs and the related sphingosine and diacylglycerol kinases.</p>

<p>The hexameric purine nucleoside phosphorylase from Bacillus subtilis (BsPNP233) displays great potential to produce nucleoside analogues in industry and can be exploited in the development of new anti-tumor gene therapies. In order to provide structural basis for enzyme and substrates rational optimization, aiming at those applications, the present work shows a thorough and detailed structural description of the binding mode of substrates and nucleoside analogues to the active site of the hexameric BsPNP233. Here we report the crystal structure of BsPNP233 in the apo form and in complex with 11 ligands, including clinically relevant compounds. The crystal structure of six ligands (adenine, 2'deoxyguanosine, aciclovir, ganciclovir, 8-bromoguanosine, 6-chloroguanosine) in complex with a hexameric PNP are presented for the first time. Our data showed that free bases adopt alternative conformations in the BsPNP233 active site and indicated that binding of the co-substrate (2'deoxy)ribose 1-phosphate might contribute for stabilizing the bases in a favorable orientation for catalysis. The BsPNP233-adenosine complex revealed that a hydrogen bond between the 5' hydroxyl group of adenosine and Arg(43*) side chain contributes for the ribosyl radical to adopt an unusual C3'-endo conformation. The structures with 6-chloroguanosine and 8-bromoguanosine pointed out that the Cl(6) and Br(8) substrate modifications seem to be detrimental for catalysis and can be explored in the design of inhibitors for hexameric PNPs from pathogens. Our data also corroborated the competitive inhibition mechanism of hexameric PNPs by tubercidin and suggested that the acyclic nucleoside ganciclovir is a better inhibitor for hexameric PNPs than aciclovir. Furthermore, comparative structural analyses indicated that the replacement of Ser(90) by a threonine in the B. cereus hexameric adenosine phosphorylase (Thr(91)) is responsible for the lack of negative cooperativity of phosphate binding in this enzyme.</p>

<p>Salmonella typhimurium DCyD (StDCyD) is a fold type II pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of D-Cys to H(2)S and pyruvate. It also efficiently degrades β-chloro-D-alanine (βCDA). D-Ser is a poor substrate while the enzyme is inactive with respect to L-Ser and 1-amino-1-carboxy cyclopropane (ACC). Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of StDCyD and of crystals obtained in the presence of D-Cys, βCDA, ACC, D-Ser, L-Ser, D-cycloserine (DCS) and L-cycloserine (LCS) at resolutions ranging from 1.7 to 2.6 Å. The polypeptide fold of StDCyD consisting of a small domain (residues 48-161) and a large domain (residues 1-47 and 162-328) resembles other fold type II PLP dependent enzymes. The structures obtained in the presence of D-Cys and βCDA show the product, pyruvate, bound at a site 4.0-6.0 Å away from the active site. ACC forms an external aldimine complex while D- and L-Ser bind non-covalently suggesting that the reaction with these ligands is arrested at Cα proton abstraction and transimination steps, respectively. In the active site of StDCyD cocrystallized with DCS or LCS, electron density for a pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) was observed. Crystals soaked in cocktail containing these ligands show density for PLP-cycloserine. Spectroscopic observations also suggest formation of PMP by the hydrolysis of cycloserines. Mutational studies suggest that Ser78 and Gln77 are key determinants of enzyme specificity and the phenolate of Tyr287 is responsible for Cα proton abstraction from D-Cys. Based on these studies, a probable mechanism for the degradation of D-Cys by StDCyD is proposed.</p>

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase Trr1 plays an important role in multiple cellular events under the control of transcription factor Yap1 and/or Rho5. Here we present the crystal structure of Trr1 at the resolution of 2.8 A, the first fungal TrxR structure. Structural analysis shows it shares a very similar overall structure to Escherichia coli TrxR. However, fine comparisons indicate some distinct differences at the Trx recognition sites. These differences might be responsible to the species-specific recognition of Trx, which has been demonstrated by previous biochemical assays.</p>

<p>3'-Uridylylation of RNA is emerging as a phylogenetically widespread phenomenon involved in processing events as diverse as uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing in mitochondria of trypanosomes and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation in humans. This reaction is catalyzed by terminal uridylyltransferases (TUTases), which are template-independent RNA nucleotidyltransferases that specifically recognize UTP and belong to a large enzyme superfamily typified by DNA polymerase beta. Multiple TUTases, recently identified in trypanosomes, as well as a U6 snRNA-specific TUTase enzyme in humans, are highly divergent at the protein sequence level. However, they all possess conserved catalytic and UTP recognition domains, often accompanied by various auxiliary modules present at the termini or between conserved domains. Here we report identification, structural and biochemical analyses of a novel trypanosomal TUTase, TbTUT4, which represents a minimal catalytically active RNA uridylyltransferase. The TbTUT4 consists of only two domains that define the catalytic center at the bottom of the nucleoside triphosphate and RNA substrate binding cleft. The 2.0 Angstroms crystal structure reveals two significantly different conformations of this TUTase: one molecule is in a relatively open apo conformation, whereas the other displays a more compact TUTase-UTP complex. A single nucleoside triphosphate is bound in the active site by a complex network of interactions between amino acid residues, a magnesium ion and highly ordered water molecules with the UTP's base, ribose and phosphate moieties. The structure-guided mutagenesis and cross-linking studies define the amino acids essential for catalysis, uracil base recognition, ribose binding and phosphate coordination by uridylyltransferases. In addition, the cluster of positively charged residues involved in RNA binding is identified. We also report a 2.4 Angstroms crystal structure of TbTUT4 with the bound 2' deoxyribonucleoside, which provides the structural basis of the enzyme's preference toward ribonucleotides.</p>

<p>Bacteria frequently possess two type IIA DNA topoisomerases, gyrase and topo IV, which maintain chromosome topology by variously supercoiling, relaxing, and disentangling DNA. DNA recognition and functional output is thought to be controlled by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the topoisomerase DNA binding subunit (GyrA/ParC). The deeply rooted organism Aquifex aeolicus encodes one type IIA topoisomerase conflictingly categorized as either DNA gyrase or topo IV. To resolve this enzyme's catalytic properties and heritage, we conducted a series of structural and biochemical studies on the isolated GyrA/ParC CTD and the holoenzyme. Whereas the CTD displays a global structure similar to that seen in bone fide GyrA and ParC paralogs, it lacks a key functional motif (the "GyrA-box") and fails to wrap DNA. Biochemical assays show that the A. aeolicus topoisomerase cannot supercoil DNA, but robustly removes supercoils and decatenates DNA, two hallmark activities of topo IV. Despite these properties, phylogenetic analyses place all functional domains except the CTD squarely within a gyrase lineage, and the A. aeolicus GyrB subunit is capable of supporting supercoiling with Escherichia coli GyrA, but not DNA relaxation with E. coli ParC. Moreover, swapping the A. aeolicus GyrA/ParC CTD with the GyrA CTD from Thermotoga maritima creates an enzyme that negatively supercoils DNA. These findings identify A. aeolicus as the first bacterial species yet found to exist without a functional gyrase, and suggest an evolutionary path for generation of bacterial type IIA paralogs.</p>

<p>Isocyanide (formerly isonitrile) hydratase (EC 4.2.1.103) is an enzyme of the DJ-1 superfamily that hydrates isocyanides to yield the corresponding N-formamide. In order to understand the structural basis for isocyanide hydratase (ICH) catalysis, we determined the crystal structures of wild-type and several site-directed mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens ICH at resolutions ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 Å. We also developed a simple UV-visible spectrophotometric assay for ICH activity using 2-naphthyl isocyanide as a substrate. ICH contains a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys(101)) that is required for catalysis and interacts with Asp(17), Thr(102), and an ordered water molecule in the active site. Asp(17) has carboxylic acid bond lengths that are consistent with protonation, and we propose that it activates the ordered water molecule to hydrate organic isocyanides. In contrast to Cys(101) and Asp(17), Thr(102) is tolerant of mutagenesis, and the T102V mutation results in a substrate-inhibited enzyme. Although ICH is similar to human DJ-1 (1.6 Å C-α root mean square deviation), structural differences in the vicinity of Cys(101) disfavor the facile oxidation of this residue that is functionally important in human DJ-1 but would be detrimental to ICH activity. The ICH active site region also exhibits surprising conformational plasticity and samples two distinct conformations in the crystal. ICH represents a previously uncharacterized clade of the DJ-1 superfamily that possesses a novel enzymatic activity, demonstrating that the DJ-1 core fold can evolve diverse functions by subtle modulation of the environment of a conserved, reactive cysteine residue.</p>

<p>Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is a family of enzymes that utilizes ATP and methionine to produce S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the most crucial methyl donor in the biological methylation of biomolecules and bioactive natural products. Here, we report that the MAT from Sulfolobus solfataricus (sMAT), an enzyme from a poorly explored class of the MAT family, has the ability to produce a range of differentially alkylated AdoMet analogs in the presence of non-native methionine analogs and ATP. To investigate the molecular basis for AdoMet analog production, we have crystallized the sMAT in the AdoMet bound, S-adenosylethionine (AdoEth) bound and unbound forms. Notably, among these structures, the AdoEth bound form offers the first MAT structure containing a non-native product, and cumulatively these structures add new structural insight into the MAT family and allow for detailed active site comparison with its homologs in Escherichia coli and human. As a thermostable MAT structure from archaea, the structures herein also provide a basis for future engineering to potentially broaden AdoMet analog production as reagents for methyltransferase-catalyzed 'alkylrandomization' and/or the study of methylation in the context of biological processes.</p>

<p>The high level of amino acid conservation and structural similarity of the substrate-binding sites of the oxygenase domains of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms (eNOSoxy, iNOSoxy, nNOSoxy) make the interpretation of the structural basis of inhibitor isoform specificity a challenge, and provide few clues for the design of new selective compounds. Crystal structures of iNOSoxy and nNOSoxy complexed with the neuronal NOS-specific inhibitor AR-R17447 suggest that specificity is provided by the interaction of the chlorophenyl group with an isoform-unique substrate access channel residue (L337 in rat neuronal NOS, N115 in mouse inducible NOS). This is confirmed by biochemical analysis of site-directed mutants. Inhibitors combining guanidinium-like structural motifs with long chains specifically targeting this residue are good candidates for rational isoform-specific drug design. Based on this finding, modifications of AR-R17447 to improve the specificity for the human isoforms are suggested.</p>

<p>The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus grows optimally above 353 K and utilizes an unusual promiscuous nonphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway to metabolize both glucose and galactose. It has been proposed that a part-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway occurs in parallel in S. solfataricus, in which the 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase (KDGK) is promiscuous for both glucose and galactose metabolism. Recombinant S. solfataricus KDGK protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.1 and 1.4 M NaCl. The crystal structure of apo S. solfataricus KDGK was solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 2.0 A and a ternary complex with 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDGlu) and an ATP analogue was resolved at 2.1 A. The complex suggests that the structural basis for the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate KDGlu and 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate (KDGal) is derived from a subtle repositioning of residues that are conserved in homologous nonpromiscuous kinases.</p>

<p>The maintenance of the highly hydrophobic cell wall is central to the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within its host environment. The antigen 85 proteins (85A, 85B, and 85C) of M. tuberculosis help maintain the integrity of the cell wall 1) by catalyzing the transfer of mycolic acids to the cell wall arabinogalactan and 2) through the synthesis of trehalose dimycolate (cord factor). Additionally, these secreted proteins allow for rapid invasion of alveolar macrophages via direct interactions between the host immune system and the invading bacillus. Here we describe two crystal structures: the structure of antigen 85C co-crystallized with octylthioglucoside as substrate, resolved to 2.0 A, and the crystal structure of antigen 85A, which was solved at a resolution of 2.7 A. The structure of 85C with the substrate analog identifies residues directly involved in substrate binding. Elucidation of the antigen 85A structure, the last of the three antigen 85 homologs to be solved, shows that the active sites of the three antigen 85 proteins are virtually identical, indicating that these share the same substrate. However, in contrast to the high level of conservation within the substrate-binding site and the active site, surface residues disparate from the active site are quite variable, indicating that three antigen 85 enzymes are needed to evade the host immune system.</p>

<p>Deacetylcephalosporin C acetyltransferase (DAC-AT) catalyses the last step in the biosynthesis of cephalosporin C, a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic of large clinical importance. The acetyl transfer step has been suggested to be limiting for cephalosporin C biosynthesis, but has so far escaped detailed structural analysis. We present here the crystal structures of DAC-AT in complexes with reaction intermediates, providing crystallographic snapshots of the reaction mechanism. The enzyme is found to belong to the alpha/beta hydrolase class of acetyltransferases, and the structures support previous observations of a double displacement mechanism for the acetyl transfer reaction in other members of this class of enzymes. The structures of DAC-AT reported here provide evidence of a stable acyl-enzyme complex, thus underpinning a mechanism involving acetylation of a catalytic serine residue by acetyl coenzyme A, followed by transfer of the acetyl group to deacetylcephalosporin C through a suggested tetrahedral transition state.</p>

<p>A vital process in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle is the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway in which sulfate (SO₄⁻²) is converted to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). Dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dSir), its key enzyme, hosts a unique siroheme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor and catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite (SO₃²⁻) to H₂S. To explore this reaction, we determined the X-ray structures of dSir from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus in complex with sulfite, sulfide (S²⁻) carbon monoxide (CO), cyanide (CN⁻), nitrite (NO₂⁻), nitrate (NO₃⁻), and phosphate (PO₄³⁻). Activity measurements indicated that dSir of A. fulgidus reduces, besides sulfite and nitrite, thiosulfate (S₂O₃²⁻) and trithionate (S₃O₆²⁻) and produces the latter two compounds besides sulfide. On this basis, a three-step mechanism was proposed, each step consisting of a two-electron transfer, a two-proton uptake, and a dehydration event. In comparison, the related active site structures of the assimilatory sulfite reductase (aSir)- and dSir-SO₃²⁻complexes reveal different conformations of Argα170 and Lysα211 both interacting with the sulfite oxygens (its sulfur atom coordinates the siroheme iron), a sulfite rotation of ~60° relative to each other, and different access of solvent molecules to the sulfite oxygens from the active site cleft. Therefore, solely in dSir a further sulfite molecule can be placed in van der Waals contact with the siroheme-ligated sulfite or sulfur-oxygen intermediates necessary for forming thiosulfate and trithionate. Although reported for dSir from several sulfate-reducing bacteria, the in vivo relevance of their formation is questionable.</p>

<p>Conservation of energy based on the reduction of sulfate is of fundamental importance for the biogeochemical sulfur cycle. A key enzyme of this ancient anaerobic process is the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dSir), which catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide under participation of a unique magnetically coupled siroheme-[4Fe-4S] center. We determined the crystal structure of the enzyme from the sulfate-reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus at 2-A resolution and compared it with that of the phylogenetically related assimilatory Sir (aSir). dSir is organized as a heterotetrameric (alphabeta)(2) complex composed of two catalytically independent alphabeta heterodimers. In contrast, aSir is a monomeric protein built of two fused modules that are structurally related to subunits alpha and beta except for a ferredoxin domain inserted only into the subunits of dSir. The [4Fe-4S] cluster of this ferredoxin domain is considered as the terminal redox site of the electron transfer pathway to the siroheme-[4Fe-4S] center in dSir. While aSir binds one siroheme-[4Fe-4S] center, dSir harbors two of them within each alphabeta heterodimer. Surprisingly, only one siroheme-[4Fe-4S] center in each alphabeta heterodimer is catalytically active, whereas access to the second one is blocked by a tryptophan residue. The spatial proximity of the functional and structural siroheme-[4Fe-4S] centers suggests that the catalytic activity at one active site was optimized during evolution at the expense of the enzymatic competence of the other. The sulfite binding mode and presumably the mechanism of sulfite reduction appear to be largely conserved between dSir and aSir. In addition, a scenario for the evolution of Sirs is proposed.</p>

<p>A new family of methionine-sulfoxide reductase (Msr) was recently described. The enzyme, named fRMsr, selectively reduces the R isomer at the sulfoxide function of free methionine sulfoxide (Met-R-O). The fRMsrs belong to the GAF fold family. They represent the first GAF domain to show enzymatic activity. Two other Msr families, MsrA and MsrB, were already known. MsrA and MsrB reduce free Met-S-O and Met-R-O, respectively, but exhibit higher catalytic efficiency toward Met-O within a peptide or a protein context. The fold of the three families differs. In the present work, the crystal structure of the fRMsr from Neisseria meningitidis has been determined in complex with S-Met-R-O. Based on biochemical and kinetic data as well as genomic analyses, Cys(118) is demonstrated to be the catalytic Cys on which a sulfenic acid is formed. All of the structural factors involved in the stereoselectivity of the l-Met-R-O binding were identified and account for why Met-S-O, DMSO, and a Met-O within a peptide are not substrates. Taking into account the structural, enzymatic, and biochemical information, a scenario of the catalysis for the reductase step is proposed. Based on the thiol content before and after Met-O reduction and the stoichiometry of Met formed per subunit of wild type and Cys-to-Ala mutants, a scenario of the recycling process of the N. meningitidis fRMsr is proposed. All of the biochemical, enzymatic, and structural properties of the N. meningitidis fRMsr are compared with those of MsrA and MsrB and are discussed in terms of the evolution of function of the GAF domain.</p>

<p>The bifunctional methylerythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase methylerythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspDF) is unusual in that it catalyzes nonconsecutive reactions in the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway of isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis. The crystal structure of IspDF from the bacterial pathogen Campylobacter jejuni reveals an elongated hexamer with D3 symmetry compatible with the dimeric 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase and trimeric 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase monofunctional enzymes. Complex formation of IspDF with 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (IspE), the intervening enzyme activity in the pathway, has been observed in solution for the enzymes from C. jejuni and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The monofunctional enzymes (2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, IspE, and 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase) involved in the DOXP biosynthetic pathway of Escherichia coli also show physical associations. We propose that complex formation of the three enzymes at the core of the DOXP pathway can produce an assembly localizing 18 catalytic centers for the early stages of isoprenoid biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Ribonuclease A is the archetype of a functionally diverse superfamily of vertebrate-specific ribonucleases. Inhibitors of its action have potential use in the elucidation of the in vivo roles of these enzymes and in the treatment of pathologies associated therewith. Derivatives of adenosine 5'-pyrophosphate are the most potent nucleotide-based inhibitors known. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to visualize the binding of four naturally-occurring derivatives that contain 5'-pyrophosphate-linked extensions. 5'-ATP binds with the adenine occupying the B(2) subsite in the manner of an RNA substrate but with the gamma-phosphate at the P(1) subsite. Diadenosine triphosphate (Ap(3)A) binds with the adenine in syn conformation, the beta-phosphate as the principal P(1) subsite ligand and without order beyond the gamma-phosphate. NADPH and NADP(+) bind with the adenine stacked against an alternative rotamer of His119, the 2'-phosphate at the P(1) subsite, and without order beyond the 5'-alpha-phosphate. We also present the structure of the complex formed with pyrophosphate ion. The structural data enable existing kinetic data on the binding of these compounds to a variety of ribonucleases to be rationalized and suggest that as the complexity of the 5'-linked extension increases, the need to avoid unfavorable contacts places limitations on the number of possible binding modes.</p>

<p>Metal ions are indispensable cofactors for chemical catalysis by a plethora of enzymes. Porphobilinogen synthases (PBGSs), which catalyse the second step of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, are grouped according to their dependence on Zn(2+). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we embarked on transforming Zn(2+)-independent Pseudomonas aeruginosa PBGS into a Zn(2+)-dependent enzyme. Nine PBGS variants were generated by permutationally introducing three cysteine residues and a further two residues into the active site of the enzyme to match the homologous Zn(2+)-containing PBGS from Escherichia coli. Crystal structures of seven enzyme variants were solved to elucidate the nature of Zn(2+) coordination at high resolution. The three single-cysteine variants were invariably found to be enzymatically inactive and only one (D139C) was found to bind detectable amounts of Zn(2+). The double mutant A129C/D139C is enzymatically active and binds Zn(2+) in a tetrahedral coordination. Structurally and functionally it mimics mycobacterial PBGS, which bears an equivalent Zn(2+)-coordination site. The remaining two double mutants, without known natural equivalents, reveal strongly distorted tetrahedral Zn(2+)-binding sites. Variant A129C/D131C possesses weak PBGS activity while D131C/D139C is inactive. The triple mutant A129C/D131C/D139C, finally, displays an almost ideal tetrahedral Zn(2+)-binding geometry and a significant Zn(2+)-dependent enzymatic activity. Two additional amino acid exchanges further optimize the active site architecture towards the E.coli enzyme with an additional increase in activity. Our study delineates the potential evolutionary path between Zn(2+)-free and Zn(2+)-dependent PBGS enyzmes showing that the rigid backbone of PBGS enzymes is an ideal framework to create or eliminate metal dependence through a limited number of amino acid exchanges.</p>

The monofunctional enzymes (2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, IspE, and 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase) involved in the DOXP biosynthetic pathway of Escherichia coli also show physical associations.

<p>The mixed-lineage leukemia protein MLL1 is a transcriptional regulator with an essential role in early development and hematopoiesis. The biological function of MLL1 is mediated by the histone H3K4 methyltransferase activity of the carboxyl-terminal SET domain. We have determined the crystal structure of the MLL1 SET domain in complex with cofactor product AdoHcy and a histone H3 peptide. This structure indicates that, in order to form a well-ordered active site, a highly variable but essential component of the SET domain must be repositioned. To test this idea, we compared the effect of the addition of MLL complex members on methyltransferase activity and show that both RbBP5 and Ash2L but not Wdr5 stimulate activity. Additionally, we have determined the effect of posttranslational modifications on histone H3 residues downstream and upstream from the target lysine and provide a structural explanation for why H3T3 phosphorylation and H3K9 acetylation regulate activity.</p>

<p>Rhodobacter capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is an (alphabeta)(2) heterotetrameric cytoplasmic enzyme that resembles eukaryotic xanthine oxidoreductases in respect to both amino acid sequence and structural fold. To obtain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of substrate and inhibitor binding at the active site, we solved crystal structures of R. capsulatus XDH in the presence of its substrates hypoxanthine, xanthine, and the inhibitor pterin-6-aldehyde using either the inactive desulfo form of the enzyme or an active site mutant (E(B)232Q) to prevent substrate turnover. The hypoxanthine- and xanthine-bound structures reveal the orientation of both substrates at the active site and show the importance of residue Glu(B)-232 for substrate positioning. The oxygen atom at the C-6 position of both substrates is oriented toward Arg(B)-310 in the active site. Thus the substrates bind in an orientation opposite to the one seen in the structure of the reduced enzyme with the inhibitor oxypurinol. The tightness of the substrates in the active site suggests that the intermediate products must exit the binding pocket to allow first the attack of the C-2, followed by oxidation of the C-8 atom to form the final product uric acid. Structural studies of pterin-6-aldehyde, a potent inhibitor of R. capsulatus XDH, contribute further to the understanding of the relative positioning of inhibitors and substrates in the binding pocket. Steady state kinetics reveal a competitive inhibition pattern with a K(i) of 103.57 +/- 18.96 nm for pterin-6-aldehyde.</p>

<p>The structures of beta-methylenethiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), NAD(+), and NADH as bound to ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase 2.2 from rat and to its mutants E189I and E189A, respectively, have been established. The positions and conformations of NAD(+) and its analogues agree in general with those in other ADP-ribosyltransferases. The kinetic constants for NAD(+) hydrolysis were determined by RP-HPLC. The specific activity amounts to 26 units/mg, which is 6000-fold higher than a previously reported rate and 500-fold higher than the hydrolysis rates of other ADP-ribosyltransferases, confirming that hydrolysis is the major function of this enzyme. On the basis of structures and mutant activities, a catalytic mechanism is proposed. The known auto-ADP-ribosylation of the enzyme at the suggested position R184 is supported by one of the crystal structures where the nucleophile position is occupied by an Neta atom of this arginine which in turn is backed up by the base E159.</p>

<p>The structures of beta-methylenethiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), NAD(+), and NADH as bound to ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase 2.2 from rat and to its mutants E189I and E189A, respectively, have been established. The positions and conformations of NAD(+) and its analogues agree in general with those in other ADP-ribosyltransferases. The kinetic constants for NAD(+) hydrolysis were determined by RP-HPLC.

<p>A chimeric feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) protease (PR) has been engineered that supports infectivity but confers sensitivity to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) PR inhibitors darunavir (DRV) and lopinavir (LPV). The 6s-98S PR has five replacements mimicking homologous residues in HIV PR and a sixth which mutated from Pro to Ser during selection. Crystal structures of the 6s-98S FIV PR chimera with DRV and LPV bound have been determined at 1.7 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal the role of a flexible 90s loop and residue 98 in supporting Gag processing and infectivity and the roles of residue 37 in the active site and residues 55, 57 and 59 in the flap in conferring the ability to specifically recognize HIV PR drugs. Specifically, Ile37Val preserves tertiary structure but prevents steric clashes with DRV and LPV. Asn55Met and Val59Ile induce a distinct kink in the flap and a new hydrogen bond to DRV. Ile98Pro→Ser and Pro100Asn increase 90s loop flexibility, Gln99Val contributes hydrophobic contacts to DRV and LPV, and Pro100Asn forms compensatory hydrogen bonds. The chimeric PR exhibits a comparable number of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic contacts with DRV and LPV as in the corresponding HIV PR complexes, consistent with IC(50) values in the nanomolar range.</p>

<p>Cytosine deamination is a major promutagenic process, generating G:U mismatches that can cause transition mutations if not repaired. Uracil is also introduced into DNA via nonmutagenic incorporation of dUTP during replication. In bacteria, uracil is excised by uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDG) related to E. coli UNG, and UNG homologs are found in mammals and viruses. Ung knockout mice display no increase in mutation frequency due to a second UDG activity, SMUG1, which is specialized for antimutational uracil excision in mammalian cells. Remarkably, SMUG1 also excises the oxidation-damage product 5-hydroxymethyluracil (HmU), but like UNG is inactive against thymine (5-methyluracil), a chemical substructure of HmU. We have solved the crystal structure of SMUG1 complexed with DNA and base-excision products. This structure indicates a more invasive interaction with dsDNA than observed with other UDGs and reveals an elegant water displacement/replacement mechanism that allows SMUG1 to exclude thymine from its active site while accepting HmU.</p>

<p>The X-ray structures of native endothiapepsin and a complex with a hydroxyethylene transition state analog inhibitor (H261) have been determined at atomic resolution. Unrestrained refinement of the carboxyl groups of the enzyme by using the atomic resolution data indicates that both catalytic aspartates in the native enzyme share a single negative charge equally; that is, in the crystal, one half of the active sites have Asp 32 ionized and the other half have Asp 215 ionized. The electron density map of the native enzyme refined at 0.9 A resolution demonstrates that there is a short peptide (probably Ser-Thr) bound noncovalently in the active site cleft. The N-terminal nitrogen of the dipeptide interacts with the aspartate diad of the enzyme by hydrogen bonds involving the carboxyl of Asp 215 and the catalytic water molecule. This is consistent with classical findings that the aspartic proteinases can be inhibited weakly by short peptides and that these enzymes can catalyze transpeptidation reactions. The dipeptide may originate from autolysis of the N-terminal Ser-Thr sequence of the enzyme during crystallization.</p>

<p>The tyrosine aminomutase SgTAM produces (S)-ss-tyrosine from L-tyrosine in the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027. This conversion is promoted by the methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO) prosthetic group. MIO was first identified in the homologous family of ammonia lyases, which deaminate aromatic amino acids to form alpha,ss-unsaturated carboxylates. Studies of substrate specificity have been described for lyases but there have been limited reports in altering the substrate specificity of aminomutases. Furthermore, it remains unclear as to what structural properties are responsible for catalyzing the presumed readdition of the amino group into the alpha,ss-unsaturated intermediates to form ss-amino acids. Attempts to elucidate specificity and mechanistic determinants of SgTAM have also proved to be difficult as it is recalcitrant to perturbations to the active site via mutagenesis. An X-ray cocrystal structure of the SgTAM mutant of the catalytic base with L-tyrosine verified important substrate binding residues as well as the enzymatic base. Further mutagenesis revealed that removal of these crucial interactions renders the enzyme inactive. Proposed structural determinants for mutase activity probed via mutagenesis, time-point assays and X-ray crystallography revealed a complicated role for these residues in maintaining key quaternary structure properties that aid in catalysis.</p>

<p>Binding affinity optimization is critical during drug development. Here, we evaluate the thermodynamic consequences of filling a binding cavity with functionalities of increasing van der Waals radii (-H, -F, -Cl, and CH(3)) that improve the geometric fit without participating in hydrogen bonding or other specific interactions. We observe a binding affinity increase of two orders of magnitude. There appears to be three phases in the process. The first phase is associated with the formation of stable van der Waals interactions. This phase is characterized by a gain in binding enthalpy and a loss in binding entropy, attributed to a loss of conformational degrees of freedom. For the specific case presented in this article, the enthalpy gain amounts to -1.5 kcal/mol while the entropic losses amount to +0.9 kcal/mol resulting in a net 3.5-fold affinity gain. The second phase is characterized by simultaneous enthalpic and entropic gains. This phase improves the binding affinity 25-fold. The third phase represents the collapse of the trend and is triggered by the introduction of chemical functionalities larger than the binding cavity itself [CH(CH(3))(2)]. It is characterized by large enthalpy and affinity losses. The thermodynamic signatures associated with each phase provide guidelines for lead optimization.</p>

<p>Enzymes are proficient catalysts that enable fast rates of Michaelis-complex formation, the chemical step and products release. These different steps may require different conformational states of the active site that have distinct binding properties. Moreover, the conformational flexibility of the active site mediates alternative, promiscuous functions. Here we focused on the lactonase SsoPox from Sulfolobus solfataricus. SsoPox is a native lactonase endowed with promiscuous phosphotriesterase activity. We identified a position in the active site loop (W263) that governs its flexibility, and thereby affects the substrate specificity of the enzyme. We isolated two different sets of substitutions at position 263 that induce two distinct conformational sampling of the active loop and characterized the structural and kinetic effects of these substitutions. These sets of mutations selectively and distinctly mediate the improvement of the promiscuous phosphotriesterase and oxo-lactonase activities of SsoPox by increasing active-site loop flexibility. These observations corroborate the idea that conformational diversity governs enzymatic promiscuity and is a key feature of protein evolvability. </p>

<p>We have employed a fragment-based screen against wild-type (NL4-3) HIV protease (PR) using the Active Sight fragment library and X-ray crystallography. The experiments reveal two new binding sites for small molecules. PR was co-crystallized with fragments, or crystals were soaked in fragment solutions, using five crystal forms, and 378 data sets were collected to 2.3-1.3 A resolution. Fragment binding induces a distinct conformation and specific crystal form of TL-3 inhibited PR during co-crystallization. One fragment, 2-methylcyclohexanol, binds in the 'exo site' adjacent to the Gly(16)Gly(17)Gln(18)loop where the amide of Gly(17)is a specific hydrogen bond donor, and hydrophobic contacts occur with the side chains of Lys(14)and Leu(63). Another fragment, indole-6-carboxylic acid, binds on the 'outside/top of the flap' via hydrophobic contacts with Trp(42), Pro(44), Met(46), and Lys(55), a hydrogen bond with Val(56), and a salt-bridge with Arg(57). 2-acetyl-benzothiophene also binds at this site. This study is the first fragment-based crystallographic screen against HIV PR, and the first time that fragments were screened against an inhibitor-bound drug target to search for compounds that both bind to novel sites and stabilize the inhibited conformation of the target.</p>

<p>The formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg, MutM) is a bifunctional base excision repair enzyme (DNA glycosylase/AP lyase) that removes a wide range of oxidized purines, such as 8-oxoguanine and imidazole ring-opened purines, from oxidatively damaged DNA. The structure of a non-covalent complex between the Lactoccocus lactis Fpg and a 1,3-propanediol (Pr) abasic site analogue-containing DNA has been solved. Through an asymmetric interaction along the damaged strand and the intercalation of the triad (M75/R109/F111), Fpg pushes out the Pr site from the DNA double helix, recognizing the cytosine opposite the lesion and inducing a 60 degrees bend of the DNA. The specific recognition of this cytosine provides some structural basis for understanding the divergence between Fpg and its structural homologue endo nuclease VIII towards their substrate specificities. In addition, the modelling of the 8-oxoguanine residue allows us to define an enzyme pocket that may accommodate the extrahelical oxidized base.</p>

<p>The enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is involved in the pathogenicity of Shigellae. As the crystal structure of this protein is known, it is a putative target for the structure-based design of inhibitors. Here we report a crystallographic study of several new ligands exhibiting a 2,6-diamino-3H-quinazolin-4-one scaffold, which has been shown recently to be a promising template for TGT-inhibitors. Crystal structure analysis of these complexes has revealed an unexpected movement of the side-chain of Asp102. A detailed analysis of the water network disrupted by this rotation has lead to the derivation of a new composite pharmacophore. A virtual screening has been performed based on this pharmacophore hypothesis and several new inhibitors of micromolar binding affinity with new skeletons have been discovered.</p>

<p>Transketolase is a prominent thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme in sugar metabolism that catalyzes the reversible transfer of a 2-carbon dihydroxyethyl fragment between a donor ketose and an acceptor aldose. The X-ray structures of transketolase from E. coli in a covalent complex with donor ketoses d-xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) and d-fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) at 1.47 A and 1.65 A resolution reveal significant strain in the tetrahedral cofactor-sugar adducts with a 25-30 degrees out-of-plane distortion of the C2-Calpha bond connecting the substrates' carbonyl with the C2 of the cofactor's thiazolium part. Both intermediates adopt very similar extended conformations in the active site with a perpendicular orientation of the scissile C2-C3 sugar bond relative to the thiazolium ring. The sugar-derived hydroxyl groups of the intermediates form conserved hydrogen bonds with one Asp side chain, with a cluster of His residues and with the N4' of the aminopyrimidine ring of the cofactor. The phosphate moiety is held in place by electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with Arg, His, and Ser side chains. With the exception of the thiazolium part of the cofactor, no structural changes are observable during intermediate formation indicating that the active site is poised for catalysis. DFT calculations on both X5P-thiamin and X5P-thiazolium models demonstrate that an out-of-plane distortion of the C2-Calpha bond is energetically more favorable than a coplanar bond. The X-ray structure with the acceptor aldose d-ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) noncovalently bound in the active site suggests that the sugar is present in multiple forms: in a strained ring-closed beta-d-furanose form in C2-exo conformation as well as in an extended acyclic aldehyde form, with the reactive C1 aldo function held close to Calpha of the presumably planar carbanion/enamine intermediate. The latter form of R5P may be viewed as a near attack conformation. The R5P binding site overlaps with those of the leaving group moieties of the covalent donor-cofactor adducts, demonstrating that R5P directly competes with the donor-derived products glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate, which are substrates of the reverse reaction, for the same docking site at the active site and reaction with the DHEThDP enamine.</p>

<p>Proteins of unknown function comprise a significant fraction of sequenced genomes. Defining the roles of these proteins is vital to understanding cellular processes. Here, we describe a method to determine a protein function based on the identification of its natural ligand(s) by the crystallographic screening of the binding of a metabolite library, followed by a focused search in the metabolic space. The method was applied to two protein families with unknown function, PF01256 and YjeF_N. The PF01256 proteins, represented by YxkO from Bacillus subtilis and the C-terminal domain of Tm0922 from Thermotoga maritima, were shown to catalyze ADP/ATP-dependent NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratation, a previously described orphan activity. The YjeF_N proteins, represented by mouse apolipoprotein A-I binding protein and the N-terminal domain of Tm0922, were found to interact with an adenosine diphosphoribose-related substrate and likely serve as ADP-ribosyltransferases. Crystallographic screening of metabolites serves as an efficient tool in functional analyses of uncharacterized proteins.</p>

<p>Phytases hydrolyse phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate), the principal form of phosphate stored in plant seeds to produce phosphate and lower phosphorylated myo-inositols. They are used extensively in the feed industry, and have been characterised biochemically and structurally with a number of structures in the PDB. They are divided into four distinct families: histidine acid phosphatases (HAP), β-propeller phytases, cysteine phosphatases and purple acid phosphatases and also split into three enzyme classes, the 3-, 5- and 6-phytases, depending on the position of the first phosphate in the inositol ring to be removed. We report identification, cloning, purification and 3D structures of 6-phytases from two bacteria, Hafnia alvei and Yersinia kristensenii, together with their pH optima, thermal stability, and degradation profiles for phytate. An important result is the structure of the H. alvei enzyme in complex with the substrate analogue myo-inositol hexakissulphate. In contrast to the only previous structure of a ligand-bound 6-phytase, where the 3-phosphate was unexpectedly in the catalytic site, in the H. alvei complex the expected scissile 6-phosphate (sulphate in the inhibitor) is placed in the catalytic site.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the zinc-containing exopeptidase bovine carboxypeptidase A (CPA) has been refined to high resolution, based on a data set collected from a single crystal, incorporating new sequence information based on cloning of the bovine gene. In addition, new refined structures are available for the zinc-removed form of the enzyme, apo-CPA, as well as the mercury-replaced form, Hg-CPA. The native structure reveals that the zinc-bound water molecule does not appear to more loosely bound than the rest of the zinc ligands, at least when B-factor values are considered. Nor is there any evidence for a secondary location of this water molecule. The apo-enzyme structure does not show any density in the place of the removed zinc ion. The only significant change appears to be a chi2 rotation of one zinc histidine ligand to form an ion-pair interaction with a glutamic acid side chain. The structure of Hg-CPA reveals a solvent Tris molecule bound to the mercury cation, as well as an unidentified cation bound to Glu270. The location of this citation agrees with previous proposals for the binding side of inhibitory zinc. These observations may explain some of the differences in kinetics observed in metal- replaced CPA.</p>

<p>Lipoic acid is the covalently attached cofactor of several multi-component enzyme complexes that catalyze key metabolic reactions. Attachment of lipoic acid to the lipoyl-dependent enzymes is catalyzed by lipoate-protein ligases (LPLs). In Escherichia coli, two distinct enzymes lipoate-protein ligase A (LplA) and lipB-encoded lipoyltransferase (LipB) catalyze independent pathways for lipoylation of the target proteins. The reaction catalyzed by LplA occurs in two steps. First, LplA activates exogenously supplied lipoic acid at the expense of ATP to lipoyl-AMP. Next, it transfers the enzyme-bound lipoyl-AMP to the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the lipoyl domain to give an amide linkage. To gain insight into the mechanism of action by LplA, we have determined the crystal structure of Thermoplasma acidophilum LplA in three forms: (i) the apo form; (ii) the ATP complex; and (iii) the lipoyl-AMP complex. The overall fold of LplA bears some resemblance to that of the biotinyl protein ligase module of the E. coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase/bio repressor (BirA). Lipoyl-AMP is bound deeply in the bifurcated pocket of LplA and adopts a U-shaped conformation. Only the phosphate group and part of the ribose sugar of lipoyl-AMP are accessible from the bulk solvent through a tunnel-like passage, whereas the rest of the activated intermediate is completely buried inside the active site pocket. This first view of the activated intermediate bound to LplA allowed us to propose a model of the complexes between Ta LplA and lipoyl domains, thus shedding light on the target protein/lysine residue specificity of LplA.</p>

<p>Secretory low molecular weight phospholipase A(2)s (PLA(2)s) are believed to be involved in the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor for the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Therefore, the specific inhibitors of these enzymes may act as potent anti-inflammatory agents. Similarly, the compounds with known anti-inflammatory properties should act as specific inhibitors. Two plant compounds, (a) anisic acid (4-methoxy benzoic acid) and (b) atropine (8-methyl-8-azabicyclo oct-3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate), have been used in various inflammatory disorders. Both compounds (a) and (b) have been found to inhibit PLA(2) activity having binding constants of 4.5 x 10(-5) M and 2.1 x 10(-8) M, respectively. A group IIA PLA(2) was isolated and purified from the venom of Daboia russelli pulchella (DRP) and its complexes were made with anisic acid and atropine. The crystal structures of the two complexes (i) and (ii) of PLA(2) with compounds (a) and (b) have been determined at 1.3 and 1.2 A resolutions, respectively. The high-quality observed electron densities for the two compounds allowed the accurate determinations of their atomic positions. The structures revealed that these compounds bound to the enzyme at the substrate - binding cleft and their positions were stabilized by networks of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The most characteristic interactions involving Asp 49 and His 48 were clearly observed in both complexes, although the residues that formed hydrophobic interactions with these compounds were not identical because their positions did not exactly superimpose in the large substrate-binding hydrophobic channel. Owing to a relatively small size, the structure of anisic acid did not alter upon binding to PLA(2), while that of atropine changed significantly when compared with its native crystal structure. The conformation of the protein also did not show notable changes upon the bindings of these ligands. The mode of binding of anisic acid to the present group II PLA(2) is almost identical to its binding with bovine pancreatic PLA(2) of group I. On the other hand, the binding of atropine to PLA(2) is similar to that of another plant alkaloid aristolochic acid.</p>

<p>Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type-I (GGTase-I), one of two CaaX prenyltransferases, is an essential enzyme in eukaryotes. GGTase-I catalyzes C-terminal lipidation of &gt;100 proteins, including many GTP- binding regulatory proteins. We present the first structural information for mammalian GGTase-I, including a series of substrate and product complexes that delineate the path of the chemical reaction. These structures reveal that all protein prenyltransferases share a common reaction mechanism and identify specific residues that play a dominant role in determining prenyl group specificity. This hypothesis was confirmed by converting farnesyltransferase (15-C prenyl substrate) into GGTase-I (20-C prenyl substrate) with a single point mutation. GGTase-I discriminates against farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) at the product turnover step through the inability of a 15-C FPP to displace the 20-C prenyl-peptide product. Understanding these key features of specificity is expected to contribute to optimization of anti-cancer and anti-parasite drugs.</p>

<p>Hydrogen atoms are a vital component of enzyme structure and function. In recent years, atomic resolution crystallography (&gt;or=1.2 A) has been successfully used to investigate the role of the hydrogen atom in enzymatic catalysis. Here, atomic resolution crystallography was used to study the effect of pH on cholesterol oxidase from Streptomyces sp., a flavoenzyme oxidoreductase. Crystallographic observations of the anionic oxidized flavin cofactor at basic pH are consistent with the UV-visible absorption profile of the enzyme and readily explain the reversible pH-dependent loss of oxidation activity. Furthermore, a hydrogen atom, positioned at an unusually short distance from the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Met122 at high pH, was observed, suggesting a previously unknown mechanism of cofactor stabilization. This study shows how a redox active site responds to changes in the enzyme's environment and how these changes are able to influence the mechanism of enzymatic catalysis.</p>

<p>The first structure of a P450 to an atomic resolution of 1.06 A has been solved for CYP121 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A comparison with P450 EryF (CYP107A1) reveals a remarkable overall similarity in fold with major differences residing in active site structural elements. The high resolution obtained allows visualization of several unusual aspects. The heme cofactor is bound in two distinct conformations while being notably kinked in one pyrrole group due to close interaction with the proline residue (Pro(346)) immediately following the heme iron-ligating cysteine (Cys(345)). The active site is remarkably rigid in comparison with the remainder of the structure, notwithstanding the large cavity volume of 1350 A(3). The region immediately surrounding the distal water ligand is remarkable in several aspects. Unlike other bacterial P450s, the I helix shows no deformation, similar to mammalian CYP2C5. In addition, the positively charged Arg(386) is located immediately above the heme plane, dominating the local structure. Putative proton relay pathways from protein surface to heme (converging at Ser(279)) are identified. Most interestingly, the electron density indicates weak binding of a dioxygen molecule to the P450. This structure provides a basis for rational design of putative antimycobacterial agents.</p>

<p>α-L-arabinofuranosidases are glycoside hydrolases that specifically hydrolyze non-reducing residues from arabinose-containing polysaccharides. In the case of arabinoxylans, which are the main components of hemicellulose, they are part of microbial xylanolytic systems and are necessary for complete breakdown of arabinoxylans. Glycoside hydrolase family 62 (GH62) is currently a small family of α-L-arabinofuranosidases that contains only bacterial and fungal members. Little is known about the GH62 mechanism of action, because only a few members have been biochemically characterized and no three-dimensional structure is available. Here, we present the first crystal structures of two fungal GH62 α-L-arabinofuranosidases from the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis (UmAbf62A) and ascomycete Podospora anserina (PaAbf62A). Both enzymes are able to efficiently remove the α-L-arabinosyl substituents from arabinoxylan. The overall three-dimensional structure of UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A reveals a five-bladed β-propeller fold that confirms their predicted classification into clan GH-F together with GH43 α-L-arabinofuranosidases. Crystallographic structures of the complexes with arabinose and cellotriose reveal the important role of subsites +1 and +2 for sugar binding. Intriguingly, we observed that PaAbf62A was inhibited by cello-oligosaccharides and displayed binding affinity to cellulose although no activity was observed on a range of cellulosic substrates. Bioinformatic analyses showed that UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A belong to two distinct subfamilies within the GH62 family. The results presented here provide a framework to better investigate the structure-function relationships within the GH62 family.</p>

<p>Single/multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD/MAD) experiments were performed on a crystal of an organic arsenic derivative of hen egg-white lysozyme. A para-arsanilate compound used as a crystallizing reagent was incorporated into the ordered solvent region of the lysozyme molecule. Diffraction data were collected to high resolution (&lt;/=2.0 A) at three wavelengths around the K edge (1.04 A) of arsenic at beamline BM30A, ESRF synchrotron. Anomalous Patterson maps clearly showed the main arsanilate site to be between three symmetry-related lysozyme molecules, at a location previously occupied by a para-toluenesulfonate anion. MAD phases at 2 A derived using the program SHARP led to an electron-density map of sufficient quality to start manual building of the protein model. Amplitudes from a second crystal measured to a resolution of 1.8 A at the peak wavelength revealed two additional heavy-atom sites, which reinforced the anomalous subset model and therefore dramatically improved the phasing power of the arsenic derivative. The subsequent solvent-flattened map was of such high accuracy that the program ARP/wARP was able to build a nearly complete model automatically. This work emphasizes the great potential of arsenic for de novo structure determination using anomalous dispersion methods.</p>

<p>6-Phenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-4-carbonitrile analogues were identified as potent and selective cathepsin S inhibitor against both purified enzyme and in human JY cell based cellular assays. This core has a very stable thio-trapping nitrile war-head in comparison with the well reported pyrimidine-2-carbonitrile cysteine cathepsin inhibitors. Compound 47 is also very potent in in vivo mouse spleenic Lip10 accumulation assays.</p>

<p>Water is ubiquitously present in any biological system and has therefore to be regarded as an additional binding partner in the protein-ligand binding process. Upon complex formation, a new solvent-exposed surface is generated and water molecules from the first solvation layer will arrange around this newly formed surface. So far, the influence of such water arrangements on the ligand binding properties is unknown. In this study, the binding modes of nine congeneric phosphonamidate-type inhibitors with systematically varied, size-increasing hydrophobic P2 ' substituents (from methyl to phenylethyl) addressing the hydrophobic, solvent-exposed S2 ' pocket of thermolysin were analyzed by high-resolution crystal structures and correlated with their thermodynamic binding profiles as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Overall, ΔΔG spreads over 7.0 kJ mol(-1) , ΔΔH varies by 15.8 kJ mol(-1) , and -TΔΔS by 12.1 kJ mol(-1) . Throughout the series, these changes correlate remarkably well with the geometric differences of water molecules arranged adjacent to the P2 ' substituents. Ligands with medium-sized P2 ' substituents exhibit highest affinities, presumably because of their optimal solvation patterns around these complexes. The addition, removal, or rearrangement of even a single methyl group can result in a strong modulation of the adjacent water network pattern shifting from enthalpy to entropy-driven binding. In conclusion, the quality of a water network assembled around a protein-ligand complex influences the enthalpy/entropy signature and can even modulate affinity to a surprising extent. </p>

<p>Hydrogen atoms are a vital component of enzyme structure and function. In recent years, atomic resolution crystallography (&gt;or=1.2 A) has been successfully used to investigate the role of the hydrogen atom in enzymatic catalysis. Here, atomic resolution crystallography was used to study the effect of pH on cholesterol oxidase from Streptomyces sp., a flavoenzyme oxidoreductase. Crystallographic observations of the anionic oxidized flavin cofactor at basic pH are consistent with the UV-visible absorption profile of the enzyme and readily explain the reversible pH-dependent loss of oxidation activity. Furthermore, a hydrogen atom, positioned at an unusually short distance from the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Met122 at high pH, was observed, suggesting a previously unknown mechanism of cofactor stabilization. This study shows how a redox active site responds to changes in the enzyme's environment and how these changes are able to influence the mechanism of enzymatic catalysis.</p>

<p>Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type-I (GGTase-I), one of two CaaX prenyltransferases, is an essential enzyme in eukaryotes. GGTase-I catalyzes C-terminal lipidation of &gt;100 proteins, including many GTP- binding regulatory proteins. We present the first structural information for mammalian GGTase-I, including a series of substrate and product complexes that delineate the path of the chemical reaction. These structures reveal that all protein prenyltransferases share a common reaction mechanism and identify specific residues that play a dominant role in determining prenyl group specificity. This hypothesis was confirmed by converting farnesyltransferase (15-C prenyl substrate) into GGTase-I (20-C prenyl substrate) with a single point mutation. GGTase-I discriminates against farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) at the product turnover step through the inability of a 15-C FPP to displace the 20-C prenyl-peptide product. Understanding these key features of specificity is expected to contribute to optimization of anti-cancer and anti-parasite drugs.</p>

<p>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step in methane biogenesis: the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (methyl-SCoM) by coenzyme B (CoBSH) to methane and a heterodisulfide (CoBS-SCoM). Crystallographic studies show that the active site is deeply buried within the enzyme and contains a highly reduced nickel-tetrapyrrole, coenzyme F(430). Methyl-SCoM must enter the active site prior to CoBSH, as species derived from methyl-SCoM are always observed bound to the F(430) nickel in the deepest part of the 30 A long substrate channel that leads from the protein surface to the active site. The seven-carbon mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoBSH binds within a 16 A predominantly hydrophobic part of the channel close to F(430), with the CoBSH thiolate lying closest to the nickel at a distance of 8.8 A. It has previously been suggested that binding of CoBSH initiates catalysis by inducing a conformational change that moves methyl-SCoM closer to the nickel promoting cleavage of the C-S bond of methyl-SCoM. In order to better understand the structural role of CoBSH early in the MCR mechanism, we have determined crystal structures of MCR in complex with four different CoBSH analogues: pentanoyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, and nonanoyl derivatives of CoBSH (CoB(5)SH, CoB(6)SH, CoB(8)SH, and CoB(9)SH, respectively). The data presented here reveal that the shorter CoB(5)SH mercaptoalkanoyl chain overlays with that of CoBSH but terminates two units short of the CoBSH thiolate position. In contrast, the mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoB(6)SH adopts a different conformation, such that its thiolate is coincident with the position of the CoBSH thiolate. This is consistent with the observation that CoB(6)SH is a slow substrate. A labile water in the substrate channel was found to be a sensitive indicator for the presence of CoBSH and HSCoM. The longer CoB(8)SH and CoB(9)SH analogues can be accommodated in the active site through exclusion of this water. These analogues react with Ni(III)-methyl, a proposed MCR catalytic intermediate of methanogenesis. The CoB(8)SH thiolate is 2.6 A closer to the nickel than that of CoBSH, but the additional carbon of CoB(9)SH only decreases the nickel thiolate distance a further 0.3 A. Although the analogues do not induce any structural changes in the substrate channel, the thiolates appear to preferentially bind at two distinct positions in the channel, one being the previously observed CoBSH thiolate position and the other being at a hydrophobic annulus of residues that lines the channel proximal to the nickel.</p>

<p>Oxicams are widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but little is known about the molecular basis of the interaction with their target enzymes, the cyclooxygenases (COX). Isoxicam is a non-selective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 whereas meloxicam displays some selectivity for COX-2. Here we report crystal complexes of COX-2 with isoxicam and meloxicam at 2.0 angstroms and 2.45 angstroms, respectively, and a crystal complex of COX-1 with meloxicam at 2.4 angstroms. These structures reveal that the oxicams bind to the active site of COX-2 using a binding pose not seen with other NSAIDs through two highly coordinated water molecules. The 4-hydroxyl group on the thiazine ring partners with Ser-530 via hydrogen bonding and the heteroatom of the carboxamide ring of the oxicam scaffold interacts with Tyr-385 and Ser-530 through a highly coordinated water molecule. The nitrogen atom of the thiazine and the oxygen atom of the carboxamide bind to Arg-120 and Tyr-355 via another highly ordered water molecule. The rotation of Leu-531 in the structure opens a novel-binding pocket, which is not utilized for the binding of other NSAIDs. In addition, a detailed study of meloxicam-COX-2 interactions revealed that mutation of Val-434 to Ile significantly reduces inhibition by meloxicam due to subtle changes around Phe-518, giving rise to the preferential inhibition of COX-2 over COX-1.</p>

<p>A series of new zinc binding groups (ZBGs) has been evaluated kinetically on 13 carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms. The fragments show affinity for all isoforms with IC(50) values in the range of 2-11 microM. The crystal structure of hCA II in complex with one such fragment reveals a bidentate binding mode with a trigonal-bipyramidal coordination geometry at the Zn(2+) center. The fragment also interacts with Thr199 and Thr200 through hydrogen bonding and participates in a water network. Further development of this ZBG should increase the binding affinity leading to a structurally distinct and promising class of CA inhibitors.</p>

<p>Rieske oxygenase (RO) systems are two- and three-component enzyme systems that catalyze the formation of cis-dihydrodiols from aromatic substrates. Degradation of pollutants in contaminated soil and generation of chiral synthons have been the major foci of RO research. Substrate specificity and product regio- and stereoselectivity have been shown to vary between individual ROs. While directed evolution methods for altering RO function have been successful in the past, rational engineering of these enzymes still poses a challenge due to the lack of structural understanding. Here we examine the structural changes induced by mutation of Phe-352 in naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIB 9816-4 (NDO-O(9816-4)). Structures of the Phe-352-Val mutant in native form and in complex with phenanthrene and anthracene, along with those of wild-type NDO-O(9816-4) in complex with phenanthrene, anthracene, and 3-nitrotoluene, are presented. Phenanthrene was shown to bind in a different orientation in the Phe-352-Val mutant active site from that in the wild type, while anthracene was found to bind in similar positions in both enzymes. Two orientations of 3-nitrotoluene were observed, i.e., a productive and a nonproductive orientation. These orientations help explain why NDO-O(9816-4) forms different products from 3-nitrotoluene than those made from nitrobenzene dioxygenase. Comparison of these structures among themselves and with other known ROs bound to substrates reveals that the orientation of substrate binding at the active site is the primary determinant of product regio- and stereoselectivity.</p>

<p>Protease inhibitors (PIs) are an important class of drugs for the treatment of HIV infection. However, in the course of treatment, resistant viral variants with reduced sensitivity to PIs often emerge and become a major obstacle to successful control of viral load. On the basis of a compound equipotently inhibiting HIV-1 and 2 proteases (PR), we have designed a pseudopeptide inhibitor, QF34, that efficiently inhibits a wide variety of PR variants. In order to analyze the potency of the inhibitor, we constructed PR species harboring the typical (signature) mutations that confer resistance to commercially available PIs. Kinetic analyses showed that these mutated PRs were inhibited up to 1,000-fold less efficiently by the clinically approved PIs. In contrast, all PR species were effectively inhibited by QF34. In a clinical study, we have monitored 30 HIV-positive patients in the Czech Republic undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy, and have identified highly PI resistant variants. Kinetic analyses revealed that QF34 retained its subnanomolar potency against multi-drug resistant PR variants. X-ray crystallographic analysis and molecular modeling experiments explained the wide specificity of QF34: this inhibitor binds to the PR in an unusual manner, thus avoiding contact sites that are mutated upon resistance development, and the unusual binding mode and consequently the binding energy is therefore preserved in the complex with a resistant variant. These results suggest a promising route for the design of second-generation PIs that are active against a variety of resistant PR variants.</p>

<p>Human tankyrases are attractive drug targets, especially for the treatment of cancer. We identified a set of highly potent tankyrase inhibitors based on a 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one scaffold. Substitutions at the para position of the scaffold's phenyl group were evaluated as a strategy to increase potency and improve selectivity. The best compounds displayed single-digit nanomolar potencies, and profiling against several human diphtheria-toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases revealed that a subset of these compounds are highly selective tankyrase inhibitors. The compounds also effectively inhibit Wnt signaling in HEK293 cells. The binding mode of all inhibitors was studied by protein X-ray crystallography. This allowed us to establish a structural basis for the development of highly potent and selective tankyrase inhibitors based on the 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one scaffold and outline a rational approach to the modification of other inhibitor scaffolds that bind to the nicotinamide site of the catalytic domain. </p>

<p>AKR1D1 (steroid 5beta-reductase) reduces all Delta(4)-3-ketosteroids to form 5beta-dihydrosteroids, a first step in the clearance of steroid hormones and an essential step in the synthesis of all bile acids. The reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone by 5beta-reductase is a unique reaction in steroid enzymology because hydride transfer from NADPH to the beta-face of a Delta(4)-3-ketosteroid yields a cis-A/B-ring configuration with an approximately 90 degrees bend in steroid structure. Here, we report the first x-ray crystal structure of a mammalian steroid hormone carbon-carbon double bond reductase, human Delta(4)-3-ketosteroid 5beta-reductase (AKR1D1), and its complexes with intact substrates. We have determined the structures of AKR1D1 complexes with NADP(+) at 1.79- and 1.35-A resolution (HEPES bound in the active site), NADP(+) and cortisone at 1.90-A resolution, NADP(+) and progesterone at 2.03-A resolution, and NADP(+) and testosterone at 1.62-A resolution. Complexes with cortisone and progesterone reveal productive substrate binding orientations based on the proximity of each steroid carbon-carbon double bond to the re-face of the nicotinamide ring of NADP(+). This orientation would permit 4-pro-(R)-hydride transfer from NADPH. Each steroid carbonyl accepts hydrogen bonds from catalytic residues Tyr(58) and Glu(120). The Y58F and E120A mutants are devoid of activity, supporting a role for this dyad in the catalytic mechanism. Intriguingly, testosterone binds nonproductively, thereby rationalizing the substrate inhibition observed with this particular steroid. The locations of disease-linked mutations thought to be responsible for bile acid deficiency are also revealed.</p>

<p>Sirtuins are protein deacetylases regulating metabolism and stress responses. The seven human Sirtuins (Sirt1-7) are attractive drug targets, but Sirtuin inhibition mechanisms are mostly unidentified. We report the molecular mechanism of Sirtuin inhibition by 6-chloro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide (Ex-527). Inhibitor binding to potently inhibited Sirt1 and Thermotoga maritima Sir2 and to moderately inhibited Sirt3 requires NAD(+), alone or together with acetylpeptide. Crystal structures of several Sirtuin inhibitor complexes show that Ex-527 occupies the nicotinamide site and a neighboring pocket and contacts the ribose of NAD(+) or of the coproduct 2'-O-acetyl-ADP ribose. Complex structures with native alkylimidate and thio-analog support its catalytic relevance and show, together with biochemical assays, that only the coproduct complex is relevant for inhibition by Ex-527, which stabilizes the closed enzyme conformation preventing product release. Ex-527 inhibition thus exploits Sirtuin catalysis, and kinetic isoform differences explain its selectivity. Our results provide insights in Sirtuin catalysis and inhibition with important implications for drug development. </p>

<p>Chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes formation of the phenylpropanoid chalcone from one p-coumaroyl-CoA and three malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters. The three-dimensional structure of CHS [Ferrer, J.-L., Jez, J. M., Bowman, M. E., Dixon, R. A., and Noel, J. P. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 775-784] suggests that four residues (Cys164, Phe215, His303, and Asn336) participate in the multiple decarboxylation and condensation reactions catalyzed by this enzyme. Here, we functionally characterize 16 point mutants of these residues for chalcone production, malonyl-CoA decarboxylation, and the ability to bind CoA and acetyl-CoA. Our results confirm Cys164's role as the active-site nucleophile in polyketide formation and elucidate the importance of His303 and Asn336 in the malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reaction. We suggest that Phe215 may help orient substrates at the active site during elongation of the polyketide intermediate. To better understand the structure-function relationships in some of these mutants, we also determined the crystal structures of the CHS C164A, H303Q, and N336A mutants refined to 1.69, 2.0, and 2.15 A resolution, respectively. The structure of the C164A mutant reveals that the proposed oxyanion hole formed by His303 and Asn336 remains undisturbed, allowing this mutant to catalyze malonyl-CoA decarboxylation without chalcone formation. The structures of the H303Q and N336A mutants support the importance of His303 and Asn336 in polarizing the thioester carbonyl of malonyl-CoA during the decarboxylation reaction. In addition, both of these residues may also participate in stabilizing the tetrahedral transition state during polyketide elongation. Conservation of the catalytic functions of the active-site residues may occur across a wide variety of condensing enzymes, including other polyketide and fatty acid synthases.</p>

<p>Fatty acid biosynthesis is crucial for all living cells. In contrast to higher organisms, bacteria use a type II fatty acid synthase (FAS II) composed of a series of individual proteins, making FAS II enzymes excellent targets for antibiotics discovery. The beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (FabZ) catalyzes an essential step in the FAS II pathway. Here, we report the structure of Campylobacter jejuni FabZ (CjFabZ), showing a hexamer both in crystals and solution, with each protomer adopting the characteristic hot dog fold. Together with biochemical analysis of CjFabZ, we define the first functional FAS II enzyme from this pathogen, and provide a framework for investigation on roles of FAS II in C. jejuni virulence.</p>

<p>The Bürgi-Dunitz angle (αBD) describes the trajectory of approach of a nucleophile to an electrophile. The adoption of a stereoelectronically favorable αBD can necessitate significant reactive-group repositioning over the course of bond formation. In the context of enzyme catalysis, interactions with the protein constrain substrate rotation, which could necessitate structural transformations during bond formation. To probe this theoretical framework vis-à-vis biocatalysis, Schiff-base formation was analysed in Francisella tularensis transaldolase (TAL). Crystal structures of wild-type and Lys→Met mutant TAL in covalent and noncovalent complexes with fructose 6-phosphate and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate clarify the mechanism of catalysis and reveal that substrate keto moieties undergo significant conformational changes during Schiff-base formation. Structural changes compelled by the trajectory considerations discussed here bear relevance to bond formation in a variety of constrained enzymic/engineered systems and can inform the design of covalent therapeutics. </p>

<p>The mechanism by which class A β-lactamases hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics has been the subject of intensive investigation using many different experimental techniques. Here, we report on the novel use of both neutron and high resolution x-ray diffraction to help elucidate the identity of the catalytic base in the acylation part of the catalytic cycle, wherein the β-lactam ring is opened and an acyl-enzyme intermediate forms. To generate protein crystals optimized for neutron diffraction, we produced a perdeuterated form of the Toho-1 β-lactamase R274N/R276N mutant. Protein perdeuteration, which involves replacing all of the hydrogen atoms in a protein with deuterium, gives a much stronger signal in neutron diffraction and enables the positions of individual deuterium atoms to be located. We also synthesized a perdeuterated acylation transition state analog, benzothiophene-2-boronic acid, which was also isotopically enriched with (11)B, as (10)B is a known neutron absorber. Using the neutron diffraction data from the perdeuterated enzyme-inhibitor complex, we were able to determine the positions of deuterium atoms in the active site directly rather than by inference. The neutron diffraction results, along with supporting bond-length analysis from high resolution x-ray diffraction, strongly suggest that Glu-166 acts as the general base during the acylation reaction.</p>

<p>Protease inhibitor resistance still poses one of the greatest challenges in treating HIV. To better design inhibitors able to target resistant proteases, a deeper understanding is needed of the effects of accumulating mutations and the contributions of active- and nonactive-site mutations to the resistance. We have engineered a series of variants containing the nonactive-site mutations M46I and I54V and the active-site mutation I84V. These mutations were added to a protease clone (V6) isolated from a pediatric patient on ritonavir therapy. This variant possessed the ritonavir-resistance-associated mutations in the active-site (V32I and V82A) and nonactive-site mutations (K20R, L33F, M36I, L63P, A71V, and L90M). The I84V mutation had the greatest effect on decreasing catalytic efficiency, 10-fold when compared to the pretherapy clone LAI. The decrease in catalytic efficiency was partially recovered by the addition of mutations M46I and I54V. The M46I and I54V were just as effective at decreasing inhibitor binding as the I84V mutation when compared to V6 and LAI. The V6(54/84) variant showed over 1000-fold decrease in inhibitor-binding strength to ritonavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir when compared to LAI and V6. Crystal-structure analysis of the V6(54/84) variant bound to ritonavir and indinavir shows structural changes in the 80's loops and active site, which lead to an enlarged binding cavity when compared to pretherapy structures in the Protein Data Bank. Structural changes are also seen in the 10's and 30's loops, which suggest possible changes in the dynamics of flap opening and closing.</p>

<p>The zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) is inhibited by several classes of zinc-binders (sulfonamides, sulfamates, and sulfamides) as well as by compounds which do not interact with the metal ion (phenols, polyamines and coumarins). Here we report a new class of potent CA inhibitors which bind the zinc ion: the dithiocarbamates (DTCs). They coordinate to the zinc ion from the enzyme active site in monodentate manner and establish many favorable interactions with amino acid residues nearby. Several low nanomolar CA I, II and IX inhibitors were detected.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis thiamin phosphate synthase complexed with the reaction products thiamin phosphate and pyrophosphate has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing techniques and refined to 1.25 A resolution. Thiamin phosphate synthase is an alpha/beta protein with a triosephosphate isomerase fold. The active site is in a pocket formed primarily by the loop regions, residues 59-67 (A loop, joining alpha3 and beta2), residues 109-114 (B loop, joining alpha5 and beta4), and residues 151-168 (C loop, joining alpha7 and beta6). The high-resolution structure of thiamin phosphate synthase complexed with its reaction products described here provides a detailed picture of the catalytically important interactions between the enzyme and the substrates. The structure and other mechanistic studies are consistent with a reaction mechanism involving the ionization of 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate at the active site to give the pyrimidine carbocation. Trapping of the carbocation by the thiazole followed by product dissociation completes the reaction. The ionization step is catalyzed by orienting the C-O bond perpendicular to the plane of the pyrimidine, by hydrogen bonding between the C4' amino group and one of the terminal oxygen atoms of the pyrophosphate, and by extensive hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the pyrophosphate and the enzyme.</p>

<p>Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) catalyzes the committed step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and l-aspartate to form N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme exhibits homotropic cooperativity and is allosterically regulated. Upon binding l-aspartate in the presence of a saturating concentration of CP, the enzyme is converted from the low-activity low-affinity T state to the high-activity high-affinity R state. The potent inhibitor N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate (PALA), which combines the binding features of Asp and CP into one molecule, has been shown to induce the allosteric transition to the R state. In the presence of only CP, the enzyme is the T structure with the active site primed for the binding of aspartate. In a structure of the enzyme-CP complex (T(CP)), two CP molecules were observed in the active site approximately 7A apart, one with high occupancy and one with low occupancy. The high occupancy site corresponds to the position for CP observed in the structure of the enzyme with CP and the aspartate analogue succinate bound. The position of the second CP is in a unique site and does not overlap with the aspartate binding site. As a means to generate a new class of inhibitors for ATCase, the domain-open T state of the enzyme was targeted. We designed, synthesized, and characterized three inhibitors that were composed of two phosphonacetamide groups linked together. These two phosphonacetamide groups mimic the positions of the two CP molecules in the T(CP) structure. X-ray crystal structures of ATCase-inhibitor complexes revealed that each of these inhibitors bind to the T state of the enzyme and occupy the active site area. As opposed to the binding of Asp in the presence of CP or PALA, these inhibitors are unable to initiate the global T to R conformational change. Although the best of these T-state inhibitors only has a K(i) value in the micromolar range, the structural information with respect to their mode of binding provides important information for the design of second generation inhibitors that will have even higher affinity for the active site of the T state of the enzyme.</p>

<p>MTERF4 is the first MTERF family member shown to bind RNA and plays an essential role as a regulator of ribosomal biogenesis in mammalian mitochondria. It forms a complex with the rRNA methyltransferase NSUN4 and recruits it to the large ribosomal subunit. In this article, we characterize the interaction between both proteins, demonstrate that MTERF4 strongly stimulates the specificity of NSUN4 during in vitro methylation experiments, and present the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of the MTERF4:NSUN4 protein complex, lacking 48 residues of the MTERF4 C-terminal acidic tail, bound to S-adenosyl-L-methionine, thus revealing the nature of the interaction between both proteins and the structural conservation of the most divergent of the human MTERF family members. Moreover, the structure suggests a model for RNA binding by the MTERF4:NSUN4 complex, providing insight into the mechanism by which an MTERF family member facilitates rRNA methylation.</p>

<p>The thiamin diphosphate- (ThDP-) dependent enzyme benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFDC) catalyzes the nonoxidative decarboxylation of benzoylformic acid to benzaldehyde and carbon dioxide. To date, no structural information for a cofactor-bound reaction intermediate in BFDC is available. For kinetic analysis, a chromophoric substrate analogue was employed that produces various absorbing intermediates during turnover but is a poor substrate with a 10(4)-fold compromised kcat. Here, we have analyzed the steady-state distribution of native intermediates by a combined chemical quench/1H NMR spectroscopic approach and estimated the net rate constants of elementary catalytic steps. At substrate saturation, carbonyl addition of the substrate to the cofactor (k' approximately 500 s-1 at 30 degrees C) and elimination of benzaldehyde (k' approximately 2.400 s-1) were found to be partially rate-determining for catalysis, whereas decarboxylation of the transient 2-mandelyl-ThDP intermediate is 1 order of magnitude faster with k' approximately 16.000 s-1, the largest rate constant of decarboxylation in any thiamin enzyme characterized so far. The X-ray structure of a predecarboxylation intermediate analogue was determined to 1.6 A after cocrystallization of BFDC from Pseudomonas putida with benzoylphosphonic acid methyl ester. In contrast to the free acid, for which irreversible phosphorylation of active center Ser26 was reported, the methyl ester forms a covalent adduct with ThDP with a similar configuration at C2alpha as observed for other thiamin enzymes. The C2-C2alpha bond of the intermediate analogue is out of plane by 7degrees, indicating strain. The phosphonate part of the adduct forms hydrogen bonds with Ser26 and His281, and the 1-OH group is held in place by interactions with His70 and the 4'-amino group of ThDP. The phenyl ring accommodates in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe464, Phe397, Leu109, and Leu403. A comparison with the previously determined structure of BFDC in noncovalent complex with the inhibitor (R)-mandelate suggests a least motion mechanism. Binding of benzoylphosphonic acid methyl ester to BFDC was further characterized by CD spectroscopy and stopped-flow kinetics, indicating a two-step binding mechanism with a 200-fold slower carbonyl addition to ThDP than determined for benzoylformic acid, in line with the observed slight structural reorganization of Phe464 due to steric clashes with the phosphonate moiety.</p>

<p>Trypanothione reductase (TryR) is a genetically validated drug target in the parasite  Trypanosoma brucei , the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. Here we report the discovery, synthesis, and development of a novel series of TryR inhibitors based on a 3,4-dihydroquinazoline scaffold. In addition, a high resolution crystal structure of TryR, alone and in complex with substrates and inhibitors from this series, is presented. This represents the first report of a high resolution complex between a noncovalent ligand and this enzyme. Structural studies revealed that upon ligand binding the enzyme undergoes a conformational change to create a new subpocket which is occupied by an aryl group on the ligand. Therefore, the inhibitor, in effect, creates its own small binding pocket within the otherwise large, solvent exposed active site. The TryR-ligand structure was subsequently used to guide the synthesis of inhibitors, including analogues that challenged the induced subpocket. This resulted in the development of inhibitors with improved potency against both TryR and T. brucei parasites in a whole cell assay.</p>

<p>The recently discovered antibacterial compound alaremycin, produced by Streptomyces sp. A012304, structurally closely resembles 5-aminolevulinic acid, the substrate of porphobilinogen synthase. During the initial steps of heme biosynthesis, two molecules of 5-aminolevulinic acid are asymmetrically condensed to porphobilinogen. Alaremycin was found to efficiently inhibit the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Using the newly created heme-permeable strain Escherichia coli CSA1, we are able to uncouple heme biosynthesis from bacterial growth and demonstrate that alaremycin targets the heme biosynthetic pathway. Further studies focused on the activity of alaremycin against the opportunistic pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The MIC of alaremycin was determined to be 12 mM. Alaremycin was identified as a direct inhibitor of recombinant purified P. aeruginosa porphobilinogen synthase and had a K(i) of 1.33 mM. To understand the molecular basis of alaremycin's antibiotic activity at the atomic level, the P. aeruginosa porphobilinogen synthase was cocrystallized with the alaremycin. At 1.75-A resolution, the crystal structure reveals that the antibiotic efficiently blocks the active site of porphobilinogen synthase. The antibiotic binds as a reduced derivative of 5-acetamido-4-oxo-5-hexenoic acid. The corresponding methyl group is, however, not coordinated by any amino acid residues of the active site, excluding its functional relevance for alaremycin inhibition. Alaremycin is covalently bound by the catalytically important active-site lysine residue 260 and is tightly coordinated by several active-site amino acids. Our data provide a solid structural basis to further improve the activity of alaremycin for rational drug design. Potential approaches are discussed.</p>

<p>PaBADH (Pseudomonas aeruginosa betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase) catalyses the irreversible NAD(P)+-dependent oxidation of betaine aldehyde to its corresponding acid, the osmoprotector glycine betaine. This reaction is involved in the catabolism of choline and in the response of this important pathogen to the osmotic and oxidative stresses prevalent in infection sites. The crystal structure of PaBADH in complex with NADPH showed a novel covalent adduct between the C2N of the pyridine ring and the sulfur atom of the catalytic cysteine residue, Cys286. This kind of adduct has not been reported previously either for a cysteine residue or for a low-molecular-mass thiol. The Michael addition of the cysteine thiolate in the 'resting' conformation to the double bond of the α,β-unsaturated nicotinamide is facilitated by the particular conformation of NADPH in the active site of PaBADH (also observed in the crystal structure of the Cys286Ala mutant) and by an ordered water molecule hydrogen bonded to the carboxamide group. Reversible formation of NAD(P)H-Cys286 adducts in solution causes reversible enzyme inactivation as well as the loss of Cys286 reactivity towards thiol-specific reagents. This novel covalent modification may provide a physiologically relevant regulatory mechanism of the irreversible PaBADH-catalysed reaction, preventing deleterious decreases in the intracellular NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratios.</p>

<p>The transfer of the phosphopantetheine chain from coenzyme A (CoA) to the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a key protein in both fatty acid and polyketide synthesis, is catalyzed by ACP synthase (AcpS). Streptomyces coelicolor AcpS is a doubly promiscuous enzyme capable of activation of ACPs from both fatty acid and polyketide synthesis and catalyzes the transfer of modified CoA substrates. Five crystal structures have been determined, including those of ligand-free AcpS, complexes with CoA and acetyl-CoA, and two of the active site mutants, His110Ala and Asp111Ala. All five structures are trimeric and provide further insight into the mechanism of catalysis, revealing the first detailed structure of a group I active site with the essential magnesium in place. Modeling of ACP binding supported by mutational analysis suggests an explanation for the promiscuity in terms of both ACP partner and modified CoA substrates.</p>

<p>The Huisgen cycloaddition of azides and alkynes, accelerated by target biomolecules, termed "in situ click chemistry," has been successfully exploited to discover highly potent enzyme inhibitors. We have previously reported a specific Serratia marcescens chitinase B (SmChiB)-templated syn-triazole inhibitor generated in situ from an azide-bearing inhibitor and an alkyne fragment. Several in situ click chemistry studies have been reported. Although some mechanistic evidence has been obtained, such as X-ray analysis of [protein]-["click ligand"] complexes, indicating that proteins act as both mold and template between unique pairs of azide and alkyne fragments, to date, observations have been based solely on "postclick" structural information. Here, we describe crystal structures of SmChiB complexed with an azide ligand and an O-allyl oxime fragment as a mimic of a click partner, revealing a mechanism for accelerating syn-triazole formation, which allows generation of its own distinct inhibitor. We have also performed density functional theory calculations based on the X-ray structure to explore the acceleration of the Huisgen cycloaddition by SmChiB. The density functional theory calculations reasonably support that SmChiB plays a role by the cage effect during the pretranslation and posttranslation states of selective syn-triazole click formation. </p>

<p>Single agents against multiple drug targets are of increasing interest. Hormone-dependent breast cancer (HDBC) may be more effectively treated by dual inhibition of aromatase and steroid sulfatase (STS). The aromatase inhibitory pharmacophore was thus introduced into a known biphenyl STS inhibitor to give a series of novel dual aromatase-sulfatase inhibitors (DASIs). Several compounds are good aromatase or STS inhibitors and DASI 20 (IC(50): aromatase, 2.0 nM; STS, 35 nM) and its chlorinated congener 23 (IC(50): aromatase, 0.5 nM; STS, 5.5 nM) are examples that show exceptional dual potency in JEG-3 cells. Both biphenyls share a para-sulfamate-containing ring B and a ring A, which contains a triazol-1-ylmethyl meta to the biphenyl bridge and para to a nitrile. At 1 mg/kg po, 20 and 23 reduced plasma estradiol levels strongly and inhibited liver STS activity potently in vivo. 23 is nonestrogenic and potently inhibits carbonic anhydrase II (IC(50) 86 nM). A complex was crystallized and its structure was solved by X-ray crystallography. This class of DASI should encourage further development toward multitargeted therapeutic intervention in HDBC.</p>

<p>The enzyme pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1) is a potential target for new compounds to treat human African trypanosomiasis. A virtual screening campaign for fragments inhibiting PTR1 was carried out. Two novel chemical series were identified containing aminobenzothiazole and aminobenzimidazole scaffolds, respectively. One of the hits (2-amino-6-chloro-benzimidazole) was subjected to crystal structure analysis and a high resolution crystal structure in complex with PTR1 was obtained, confirming the predicted binding mode. However, the crystal structures of two analogues (2-amino-benzimidazole and 1-(3,4-dichloro-benzyl)-2-amino-benzimidazole) in complex with PTR1 revealed two alternative binding modes. In these complexes, previously unobserved protein movements and water-mediated protein-ligand contacts occurred, which prohibited a correct prediction of the binding modes. On the basis of the alternative binding mode of 1-(3,4-dichloro-benzyl)-2-amino-benzimidazole, derivatives were designed and selective PTR1 inhibitors with low nanomolar potency and favorable physicochemical properties were obtained.</p>

<p>SoxB is an essential component of the bacterial Sox sulfur oxidation pathway. SoxB contains a di-manganese(II) site and is proposed to catalyze the release of sulfate from a protein-bound cysteine S-thiosulfonate. A direct assay for SoxB activity is described. The structure of recombinant Thermus thermophilus SoxB was determined by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.5 A. Structures were also determined for SoxB in complex with the substrate analogue thiosulfate and in complex with the product sulfate. A mechanistic model for SoxB is proposed based on these structures.</p>

<p>Two different conformations of the inner loop (residues 340-346) have been found in the soybean beta-amylase structures. In the "product form", the Thr 342 residue creates hydrogen bonds with Glu 186 (catalytic acid) and with the glucose residues at subsites -1 and +1, whereas most of those interactions are lost in the "apo form". To elucidate the relationship between the structural states of the inner loop and the catalytic mechanism, Thr 342 was mutated to Val, Ser, and Ala, respectively, and their crystal structures complexed with maltose were determined together with that of the apo enzyme at 1.27-1.64 A resolutions. The k(cat) values of the T342V, T342S, and T342A mutants decreased by 13-, 360-, and 1700-fold, respectively, compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Whereas the inner loops in the wild-type/maltose and T342V/maltose complexes adopted the product form, those of the T342S/maltose and T342A/maltose complexes showed the apo form. Structural analyses suggested that the side chain of Thr 342 in product form plays an important role in distorting the sugar ring at subsite -1, stabilizing the deprotonated form of Glu 186, and grasping the glucose residue of the remaining substrate at subsite +1. The third hypothesis was proved by the fact that T342V hydrolyzes maltoheptaose following only multichain attack in contrast to multiple attack of the wild-type enzyme.</p>

<p>The transfer of the phosphopantetheine chain from coenzyme A (CoA) to the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a key protein in both fatty acid and polyketide synthesis, is catalyzed by ACP synthase (AcpS). Streptomyces coelicolor AcpS is a doubly promiscuous enzyme capable of activation of ACPs from both fatty acid and polyketide synthesis and catalyzes the transfer of modified CoA substrates.

Modeling of ACP binding supported by mutational analysis suggests an explanation for the promiscuity in terms of both ACP partner and modified CoA substrates.</p>

<p>Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is a processive exoribonuclease that contributes to messenger RNA turnover and quality control of ribosomal RNA precursors in many bacterial species. In Escherichia coli, a proportion of the PNPase is recruited into a multi-enzyme assembly, known as the RNA degradosome, through an interaction with the scaffolding domain of the endoribonuclease RNase E. Here, we report crystal structures of E. coli PNPase complexed with the recognition site from RNase E and with manganese in the presence or in the absence of modified RNA. The homotrimeric PNPase engages RNase E on the periphery of its ring-like architecture through a pseudo-continuous anti-parallel beta-sheet. A similar interaction pattern occurs in the structurally homologous human exosome between the Rrp45 and Rrp46 subunits. At the centre of the PNPase ring is a tapered channel with an adjustable aperture where RNA bases stack on phenylalanine side chains and trigger structural changes that propagate to the active sites. Manganese can substitute for magnesium as an essential co-factor for PNPase catalysis, and our crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with manganese suggests how the metal is positioned to stabilise the transition state. We discuss the implications of these structural observations for the catalytic mechanism of PNPase, its processive mode of action, and its assembly into the RNA degradosome.</p>

<p>Human glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the removal of the metabolic by-product glyoxylate from within the liver. Deficiency of this enzyme is the underlying cause of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2) and leads to increased urinary oxalate levels, formation of kidney stones and renal failure. Here we describe the crystal structure of human GRHPR at 2.2 A resolution. There are four copies of GRHPR in the crystallographic asymmetric unit: in each homodimer, one subunit forms a ternary (enzyme+NADPH+reduced substrate) complex, and the other a binary (enzyme+NADPH) form. The spatial arrangement of the two enzyme domains is the same in binary and ternary forms. This first crystal structure of a true ternary complex of an enzyme from this family demonstrates the relationship of substrate and catalytic residues within the active site, confirming earlier proposals of the mode of substrate binding, stereospecificity and likely catalytic mechanism for these enzymes. GRHPR has an unusual substrate specificity, preferring glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate, but not pyruvate. A tryptophan residue (Trp141) from the neighbouring subunit of the dimer is projected into the active site region and appears to contribute to the selectivity for hydroxypyruvate. This first crystal structure of a human GRHPR enzyme also explains the deleterious effects of naturally occurring missense mutations of this enzyme that lead to PH2.</p>

<p>The enzymatic aldose ketose isomerisation of glucose and fructose sugars involves the transfer of a hydrogen between their C1 and C2 carbon atoms and, in principle, can proceed through either a direct hydride shift or via a cis-enediol intermediate. Pyrococcus furiosus phosphoglucose isomerase (PfPGI), an archaeal metalloenzyme, which catalyses the interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, has been suggested to operate via a hydride shift mechanism. In contrast, the structurally distinct PGIs of eukaryotic or bacterial origin are thought to catalyse isomerisation via a cis-enediol intermediate. We have shown by NMR that hydrogen exchange between substrate and solvent occurs during the reaction catalysed by PfPGI eliminating the possibility of a hydride-shift-based mechanism. In addition, kinetic measurements on this enzyme have shown that 5-phospho-d-arabinonohydroxamate, a stable analogue of the putative cis-enediol intermediate, is the most potent inhibitor of the enzyme yet discovered. Furthermore, determination and analysis of crystal structures of PfPGI with bound zinc and the substrate F6P, and with a number of competitive inhibitors, and EPR analysis of the coordination of the metal ion within PfPGI, have suggested that a cis-enediol intermediate-based mechanism is used by PfPGI with Glu97 acting as the catalytic base responsible for isomerisation.</p>

<p>Kinase disregulation disrupts the intricate network of intracellular signaling pathways and contributes to the onset of diseases such as cancer. Although several kinase inhibitors are on the market, inhibitor selectivity and drug resistance mutations persist as fundamental challenges in the development of effective long-term treatments. Chemical entities binding to less conserved allosteric sites would be expected to offer new opportunities for scaffold development. Because no high-throughput method was previously available, we developed a fluorescence-based kinase binding assay for identifying and characterizing ligands which stabilize the inactive kinase conformation. Here, we present a description of the development and validation of this assay using the serine/threonine kinase p38alpha. By covalently attaching fluorophores to the activation loop of the kinase, we were able to detect conformational changes and measure the K(d), k(on), and k(off) associated with the binding and dissociation of ligands to the allosteric pocket. We report the SAR of a synthesized focused library of pyrazolourea derivatives, a scaffold known to bind with high affinity to the allosteric pocket of p38alpha. Additionally, we used protein X-ray crystallography together with our assay to examine the binding and dissociation kinetics to characterize potent quinazoline- and quinoline-based type II inhibitors, which also utilize this binding pocket in p38alpha. Last, we identified the b-Raf inhibitor sorafenib as a potent low nanomolar inhibitor of p38alpha and used protein X-ray crystallography to confirm a unique binding mode to the inactive kinase conformation.</p>

<p>Eukaryotic transcription factor B (TFB) proteins are homologous to KsgA/Dim1 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methyltransferases. The mammalian TFB1, mitochondrial (TFB1M) factor is an essential protein necessary for mitochondrial gene expression. TFB1M mediates an rRNA modification in the small ribosomal subunit and thus plays a role analogous to KsgA/Dim1 proteins. This modification has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunctions leading to maternally inherited deafness, aminoglycoside sensitivity and diabetes. Here, we present the first structural characterization of the mammalian TFB1 factor. We have solved two X-ray crystallographic structures of TFB1M with (2.1 Å) and without (2.0 Å) its cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine. These structures reveal that TFB1M shares a conserved methyltransferase core with other KsgA/Dim1 methyltransferases and shed light on the structural basis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding and methyltransferase activity. Together with mutagenesis studies, these data suggest a model for substrate binding and provide insight into the mechanism of methyl transfer, clarifying the role of this factor in an essential process for mitochondrial function. </p>

<p>Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemases are essential enzymes for branched-chain fatty acid metabolism. Their reaction mechanism and the structural basis of their wide substrate specificity are poorly understood. High-resolution crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (MCR) complexed with substrate molecules show the active site geometry required for catalysis of the interconversion of (2S) and (2R)-methylacyl-CoA. The thioester oxygen atom and the 2-methyl group are in a cis-conformation with respect to each other. The thioester oxygen atom fits into an oxyanion hole and the 2-methyl group points into a hydrophobic pocket. The active site geometry agrees with a 1,1-proton transfer mechanism in which the acid/base-pair residues are His126 and Asp156. The structures of the complexes indicate that the acyl chains of the S-substrate and the R-substrate bind in an S-pocket and an R-pocket, respectively. A unique feature of MCR is a large number of methionine residues in the acyl binding region, located between the S-pocket and the R-pocket. It appears that the (S) to (R) interconversion of the 2-methylacyl chiral center is coupled to a movement of the acyl group over this hydrophobic, methionine-rich surface, when moving from its S-pocket to its R-pocket, whereas the 2-methyl moiety and the CoA group remain fixed in their respective pockets.</p>

<p>Bacterial resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins is an issue of great concern in current antibiotic therapeutics. An important source of this resistance is from production of extended-spectrum (ES) beta-lactamases by bacteria. The Enterobacter cloacae GC1 enzyme is an example of a class C ES beta-lactamase. Unlike wild-type (WT) forms, such as the E. cloacae P99 and Citrobacter freundii enzymes, the ES GC1 beta-lactamase is able to rapidly hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime. To understand the basis for this ES activity, m-nitrophenyl 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-[(Z)-methoxyimino]acetylaminomethyl phosphonate has been synthesized and characterized. This phosphonate was designed to generate a transition state analog for turnover of cefotaxime. The crystal structures of complexes of the phosphonate with both ES GC1 and WT C. freundii GN346 beta-lactamases have been determined to high resolution (1.4-1.5 Angstroms). The serine-bound analog of the tetrahedral transition state for deacylation exhibits a very different binding geometry in each enzyme. In the WT beta-lactamase the cefotaxime-like side chain is crowded against the Omega loop and must protrude from the binding site with its methyloxime branch exposed. In the ES enzyme, a mutated Omega loop adopts an alternate conformation allowing the side chain to be much more buried. During the binding and turnover of the cefotaxime substrate by this ES enzyme, it is proposed that ligand-protein contacts and intra-ligand contacts are considerably relieved relative to WT, facilitating positioning and activation of the hydrolytic water molecule. The ES beta-lactamase is thus able to efficiently inactivate third-generation cephalosporins.</p>

<p>Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the first step in the heme degradation pathway. The crystal structures of apo- and heme-bound truncated human HO-2 reveal a primarily alpha-helical architecture similar to that of human HO-1 and other known HOs. Proper orientation of heme in HO-2 is required for the regioselective oxidation of the alpha-mesocarbon. This is accomplished by interactions within the heme binding pocket, which is made up of two helices. The iron coordinating residue, His(45), resides on the proximal helix. The distal helix contains highly conserved glycine residues that allow the helix to flex and interact with the bound heme. Tyr(154), Lys(199), and Arg(203) orient the heme through direct interactions with the heme propionates. The rearrangements of side chains in heme-bound HO-2 compared with apoHO-2 further elucidate HO-2 heme interactions.</p>

<p>Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in GMP biosynthesis. The resulting intracellular pool of guanine nucleotides is of great importance to all cells for use in DNA and RNA synthesis, metabolism, and signal transduction. The enzyme binds IMP and the cofactor NAD(+) in random order, IMP is converted to XMP, NAD(+) is reduced to NADH, and finally, NADH and then XMP are released sequentially. XMP is subsequently converted into GMP by GMP synthetase. Drugs that decrease GMP synthesis by inhibiting IMPDH have been shown to have antiproliferative as well as antiviral activity. Several drugs are in use that target the substrate- or cofactor-binding site; however, due to differences between the mammalian and microbial isoforms, most drugs are far less effective against the microbial form of the enzyme than the mammalian form. The high resolution crystal structures of the protozoan parasite Tritrichomonas foetus IMPDH complexed with the inhibitor ribavirin monophosphate as well as monophosphate together with a second inhibitor, mycophenolic acid, are presented here. These structures reveal an active site cation identified previously only in the Chinese hamster IMPDH structure with covalently bound IMP. This cation was not found previously in apo IMPDH, IMPDH in complex with XMP, or covalently bound inhibitor, indicating that the cation-binding site may be catalysis-dependent. A comparison of T. foetus IMPDH with the Chinese hamster and Streptococcus pyogenes structures reveals differences in the active site loop architecture, which contributes to differences in cation binding during the catalytic sequence and the kinetic rates between bacterial, protozoan, and mammalian enzymes. Exploitation of these differences may lead to novel inhibitors, which favor the microbial form of the enzyme.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of substrate-product complexes of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase, obtained at various steps in its catalysis of the unusual transformation of 6-cyano-uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) into barbituric acid ribosyl monophosphate, show that the cyano substituent of the substrate, when bound to the active site, is first bent significantly from the plane of the pyrimidine ring and then replaced by an oxygen atom. Although the K72A and D70A/K72A mutants are either catalytically impaired or even completely inactive, they still display bending of the C6 substituent. Interestingly, high-resolution structures of the D70A and D75N mutants revealed a covalent bond between C6 of UMP and the Lys72 side chain after the -CN moiety's release. The same covalent bond was observed when the native enzyme was incubated with 6-azido-UMP and 6-iodo-UMP; in contrast, the K72A mutant transformed 6-iodo-UMP to barbituric acid ribosyl 5'-monophosphate. These results demonstrate that, given a suitable environment, native orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase and several of its mutants are not restricted to the physiologically relevant decarboxylation; they are able to catalyze even nucleophilic substitution reactions but consistently maintain distortion on the C6 substituent as an important feature of catalysis.</p>

<p>N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK) catalyzes the second, generally controlling, step of arginine biosynthesis. In yeasts, NAGK exists either alone or forming a metabolon with N-acetyl-L-glutamate synthase (NAGS), which catalyzes the first step and exists only within the metabolon. Yeast NAGK (yNAGK) has, in addition to the amino acid kinase (AAK) domain found in other NAGKs, a ~150-residue C-terminal domain of unclear significance belonging to the DUF619 domain family. We deleted this domain, proving that it stabilizes yNAGK, slows catalysis and modulates feed-back inhibition by arginine. We determined the crystal structures of both the DUF619 domain-lacking yNAGK, ligand-free as well as complexed with acetylglutamate or acetylglutamate and arginine, and of complete mature yNAGK. While all other known arginine-inhibitable NAGKs are doughnut-like hexameric trimers of dimers of AAK domains, yNAGK has as central structure a flat tetramer formed by two dimers of AAK domains. These dimers differ from canonical AAK dimers in the -110° rotation of one subunit with respect to the other. In the hexameric enzymes, an N-terminal extension, found in all arginine-inhibitable NAGKs, forms a protruding helix that interlaces the dimers. In yNAGK, however, it conforms a two-helix platform that mediates interdimeric interactions. Arginine appears to freeze an open inactive AAK domain conformation. In the complete yNAGK structure, two pairs of DUF619 domains flank the AAK domain tetramer, providing a mechanism for the DUF619 domain modulatory functions. The DUF619 domain exhibits the histone acetyltransferase fold, resembling the catalytic domain of bacterial NAGS. However, the putative acetyl CoA site is blocked, explaining the lack of NAGS activity of yNAGK. We conclude that the tetrameric architecture is an adaptation to metabolon formation and propose an organization for this metabolon, suggesting that yNAGK may be a good model also for yeast and human NAGSs.</p>

<p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are among the most promising targets in cancer therapy. However, structural information greatly enhancing the design of HDAC inhibitors as novel chemotherapeutics has not been available on class 2 HDACs so far. Here we present the structure of the bacterial FB188 HDAH (histone deacetylase-like amidohydrolase from Bordetella/Alcaligenes strain FB188) that reveals high sequential and functional homology to human class 2 HDACs. FB188 HDAH is capable to remove the acetyl moiety from acetylated histones. Several HDAC-specific inhibitors, which have been shown to inhibit tumor activity in both pre-clinical models and in clinical trials, also inhibit FB188 HDAH. We have determined the crystal structure of FB188 HDAH at a resolution of 1.6 angstroms in complex with the reaction product acetate, as well as in complex with the inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and cyclopentyle-propionyle hydroxamic acid (CypX) at a resolution of 1.57 angstroms and 1.75 angstroms, respectively. FB188 HDAH exhibits the canonical fold of class 1 HDACs and contains a catalytic zinc ion. The highest structural diversity compared to class 1 enzymes is found in loop regions especially in the area around the entrance of the active site, indicating significant differences among the acetylated proteins binding to class 1 and 2 HDACs, respectively.</p>

<p>Enzymes of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway have been identified as essential for the growth and survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and thus have potential for the development of anti-tuberculosis drugs. The final two steps of this pathway are carried out by the bifunctional enzyme 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC), also known as PurH. This enzyme has already been the target of anti-cancer drug development. We have determined the crystal structures of the M. tuberculosis ATIC (Rv0957) both with and without the substrate 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, at resolutions of 2.5 and 2.2 Å, respectively. As for other ATIC enzymes, the protein is folded into two domains, the N-terminal domain (residues 1-212) containing the cyclohydrolase active site and the C-terminal domain (residues 222-523) containing the formyltransferase active site. An adventitiously bound nucleotide was found in the cyclohydrolase active site in both structures and was identified by NMR and mass spectral analysis as a novel 5-formyl derivative of an earlier intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway 4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide. This result and other studies suggest that this novel nucleotide is a cyclohydrolase inhibitor. The dimer formed by M. tuberculosis ATIC is different from those seen for human and avian ATICs, but it has a similar ∼50-Å separation of the two active sites of the bifunctional enzyme. Evidence in M. tuberculosis ATIC for reactivity of half-the-sites in the cyclohydrolase domains can be attributed to ligand-induced movements that propagate across the dimer interface and may be a common feature of ATIC enzymes.</p>

<p>Terpyridine-platinum(II) (TP-Pt(II)) complexes are known to possess DNA-intercalating activity and have been regarded as potential antitumor agents. However, their cytotoxic mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the possible mechanism, a series of TP-Pt(II) compounds were prepared and their biological activities assessed. The DNA binding activities of the aromatic thiolato[TP-Pt(II)] complexes were stronger than the aliphatic 2-hydroxylethanethiolato(2,2':6',2''-terpyridine)platinum(II) [TP(HET)]. TP-Pt(II) complexes inhibited topoisomerase IIalpha or topoisomerase I activity at IC(50) values of about 5 microM and 10-20 microM, respectively, whereas the human thioredoxin reductase 1 (hTrxR1) activity was inhibited with IC(50) values in the range of 58-78 nM. At the cellular level, they possessed cytotoxicity with IC(50) values between 7 and 19 microM against HeLa cells. Additionally, using X-ray crystallography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, we elucidated that the TP-Pt(II) complexes inhibited hTrxR1 activity by blocking its C-terminal active-site selenocysteine. Therefore, TP-Pt(II) complexes possess inhibitory activities against multiple biological targets, and they may be further studied as anticancer agents.</p>

<p>The HIV-1 protease (PR) mediates its own release (autoprocessing) from the polyprotein precursor, Gag-Pol, flanked by the transframe region (TFR) and reverse transcriptase at its N- and C-termini, respectively. Autoprocessing at the N-terminus of PR mediates stable dimer formation essential for catalytic activity, leading to the formation of infectious virus. An antiparallel β-sheet interface formed by the four N- and C-terminal residues of each subunit is important for dimer stability. Here, we present the first high-resolution crystal structures of model protease precursor-clinical inhibitor (PI darunavir or saquinavir) complexes, revealing varying conformations of the N-terminal flanking (S(-4)FNF(-1)) and interface residues (P(1)QIT(4)). A 180° rotation of the T(4)-L(5) peptide bond is accompanied by a new Q(2)-L(5) hydrogen bond and complete disengagement of PQIT from the β-sheet dimer interface, which may be a feature for intramolecular autoprocessing. This result is consistent with drastically lower thermal stability by 14-20 °C of PI complexes of precursors and the mature PR lacking its PQIT residues (by 18.3 °C). Similar to the TFR-PR precursor, this deletion also results in a darunavir dissociation constant (2 × 10(4))-fold higher and a markedly increased dimer dissociation constant relative to the mature PR. The terminal β-sheet perturbations of the dimeric structure likely account for the drastically poorer inhibition of autoprocessing of TFR-PR relative to the mature PR, even though significant differences in active site-PI interactions in these structures were not observed. The novel conformations of the dimer interface may be exploited to target selectively the protease precursor prior to its N-terminal cleavage.</p>

<p>The Bürgi-Dunitz angle (αBD) describes the trajectory of approach of a nucleophile to an electrophile. The adoption of a stereoelectronically favorable αBD can necessitate significant reactive-group repositioning over the course of bond formation. In the context of enzyme catalysis, interactions with the protein constrain substrate rotation, which could necessitate structural transformations during bond formation. To probe this theoretical framework vis-à-vis biocatalysis, Schiff-base formation was analysed in Francisella tularensis transaldolase (TAL). Crystal structures of wild-type and Lys→Met mutant TAL in covalent and noncovalent complexes with fructose 6-phosphate and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate clarify the mechanism of catalysis and reveal that substrate keto moieties undergo significant conformational changes during Schiff-base formation. Structural changes compelled by the trajectory considerations discussed here bear relevance to bond formation in a variety of constrained enzymic/engineered systems and can inform the design of covalent therapeutics. </p>

<p>The human asparaginase-like protein 1 (hASRGL1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-asparagine and isoaspartyl-dipeptides. As an N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily member, the active form of hASRGL1 is generated by an intramolecular cleavage step with Thr168 as the catalytic residue. However, in vitro, autoprocessing is incomplete (~50%), fettering the biophysical characterization of hASRGL1. We circumvented this obstacle by constructing a circularly permuted hASRGL1 that uncoupled the autoprocessing reaction, allowing us to kinetically and structurally characterize this enzyme and the precursor-like hASRGL1-Thr168Ala variant. Crystallographic and biochemical evidence suggest an activation mechanism where a torsional restraint on the Thr168 side chain helps drive the intramolecular processing reaction. Cleavage and formation of the active site releases the torsional restriction on Thr168, which is facilitated by a small conserved Gly-rich loop near the active site that allows the conformational changes necessary for activation.</p>

<p>Comparison of the high-resolution X-ray structures of the native HIV-1 protease and its complexes with the inhibitors suggested that the enzyme flaps are flexible. The movement at the tip of the flaps could be as large as 7 A. On the basis of this observation, cyclic cyanoguanidines have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated as HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors. Cyclic cyanoguanidines were found to be very potent inhibitors of HIV-1 protease. The choice of cyclic cyanoguanidines over cyclic guanidines was based on the reduced basicity of the former. X-ray structure studies of the HIV PR complex with cyclic cyanoguanidine demonstrated that in analogy to cyclic urea, cyclic cyanoguanidines also displace the unique structural water molecule. The structure-activity relationship of the cyclic cyanoguanidines is compared with that of the corresponding cyclic urea analogues. The differences in binding constants of the two series of compounds have been rationalized using high-resolution X-ray structure information.</p>

<p>L-Cysteine desulfurase IscS and scaffold IscU proteins are universally involved in Fe/S cluster synthesis. The Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af) genome encodes proteins having a high degree of primary structure similarity to IscS and IscU from other organisms. However, AfIscS is unusual because it lacks the active site lysine residue that normally forms an internal Schiff base with pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) and serves as a base during catalysis. Our as-isolated recombinant AfIscS contains pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) instead of the expected PLP and lacks desulfurase activity. We have solved its structure to 1.43 Å resolution and found that PMP binds non-covalently at the PLP site of the enzyme and displays significant disorder. However, the previously reported structure of recombinant Af(IscU-D35A-IscS)(2) contains an in vivo generated [Fe(2)S(2)] species within AfIscU and the question arises as to how its sulfides were generated. Here, we report that adding PLP to AfIscS produces an enzyme that displays in vitro L-cysteine desulfurase activity mediating the synthesis of a stable holo Af(IscU-D35A-IscS) complex.</p>

<p>beta-Lactamase-mediated resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics poses a major threat to our antibiotic armamentarium. Among beta-lactamases, a significant threat comes from enzymes that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefotaxime. Among the enzymes that exhibit this phenotype, the CTX-M family is found worldwide. These enzymes have a small active site, which makes it difficult to explain how they hydrolyze the bulky extended-spectrum cephalosporins into the binding site. We investigated noncovalent substrate recognition and product release in CTX-M enzymes using steered molecular dynamics simulation and X-ray diffraction. An arginine residue located far from the binding site favors the capture and tracking of substrates during entrance into the catalytic pocket. We show that the accommodation of extended-spectrum cephalosporins by CTX-M enzymes induced subtle changes in the active site and established a high density of electrostatic interactions. Interestingly, the product of the catalytic reaction initiates its own release because of steric hindrances and electrostatic repulsions. This suggests that there exists a general mechanism for product release for all members of the beta-lactamase family and probably for most carboxypeptidases.</p>

<p>Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of the genetically encoded guanine at the wobble position of tRNAs(His,Tyr,Asp,Asn) by the premodified base preQ1, which is further converted to queuine at the tRNA level. As eucaryotes are not able to synthesise queuine de novo but acquire it through their diet, eucaryotic Tgt directly inserts the hypermodified base into the wobble position of the tRNAs mentioned above. Bacterial Tgt is required for the efficient pathogenicity of Shigella sp, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and, hence, it constitutes a putative target for the rational design of anti-Shigellosis compounds. Since mammalian Tgt is known to be indirectly essential to the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, it is necessary to create substances which only inhibit bacterial but not eucaryotic Tgt. Therefore, it seems of utmost importance to study selectivity-determining features within both types of proteins. Homology models of Caenorhabditis elegans Tgt and human Tgt suggest that the replacement of Cys158 and Val233 in bacterial Tgt (Zymomonas mobilis Tgt numbering) by valine and accordingly glycine in eucaryotic Tgt largely accounts for the different substrate specificities. In the present study we have created mutated variants of Z. mobilis Tgt in order to investigate the impact of a Cys158Val and a Val233Gly exchange on catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we gained evidence that the Cys158Val mutation reduces the affinity to preQ1 while leaving the affinity to guanine unaffected. The Val233Gly exchange leads to an enlarged substrate binding pocket, that is necessary to accommodate queuine in a conformation compatible with the intermediately covalently bound tRNA molecule. Contrary to our expectations, we found that a priori queuine is recognised by the binding pocket of bacterial Tgt without, however, being used as a substrate.</p>

<p>Meta-cleavage product (MCP) hydrolases are members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily that utilize a Ser-His-Asp triad to catalyze the hydrolysis of a C-C bond. BphD, the MCP hydrolase from the biphenyl degradation pathway, hydrolyzes 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA) to 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoic acid (HPD) and benzoate. A 1.6 Å resolution crystal structure of BphD H265Q incubated with HOPDA revealed that the enzyme's catalytic serine was benzoylated. The acyl-enzyme is stabilized by hydrogen bonding from the amide backbone of 'oxyanion hole' residues, consistent with formation of a tetrahedral oxyanion during nucleophilic attack by Ser112. Chemical quench and mass spectrometry studies substantiated the formation and decay of a Ser112-benzoyl species in wild-type BphD on a time scale consistent with turnover and incorporation of a single equivalent of (18)O into the benzoate produced during hydrolysis in H(2)(18)O. Rapid-scanning kinetic studies indicated that the catalytic histidine contributes to the rate of acylation by only an order of magnitude, but affects the rate of deacylation by over 5 orders of magnitude. The orange-colored catalytic intermediate, ES(red), previously detected in the wild-type enzyme and proposed herein to be a carbanion, was not observed during hydrolysis by H265Q. In the newly proposed mechanism, the carbanion abstracts a proton from Ser112, thereby completing tautomerization and generating a serinate for nucleophilic attack on the C6-carbonyl. Finally, quantification of an observed pre-steady-state kinetic burst suggests that BphD is a half-site reactive enzyme. While the updated catalytic mechanism shares features with the serine proteases, MCP hydrolase-specific chemistry highlights the versatility of the Ser-His-Asp triad.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of 2-methylisoborneol synthase (MIBS) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has been determined in complex with substrate analogues geranyl-S-thiolodiphosphate and 2-fluorogeranyl diphosphate at 1.80 and 1.95 Å resolution, respectively. This terpenoid cyclase catalyzes the cyclization of the naturally occurring, noncanonical C-methylated isoprenoid substrate, 2-methylgeranyl diphosphate, to form the bicyclic product 2-methylisoborneol, a volatile C(11) homoterpene alcohol with an earthy, musty odor. While MIBS adopts the tertiary structure of a class I terpenoid cyclase, its dimeric quaternary structure differs from that previously observed in dimeric terpenoid cyclases from plants and fungi. The quaternary structure of MIBS is nonetheless similar in some respects to that of dimeric farnesyl diphosphate synthase, which is not a cyclase. The structures of MIBS complexed with substrate analogues provide insights regarding differences in the catalytic mechanism of MIBS and the mechanisms of (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase and endo-fenchol synthase, plant cyclases that convert geranyl diphosphate into products with closely related bicyclic bornyl skeletons, but distinct structures and stereochemistries.</p>

<p>The main proteinase (M(pro)) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is a principal target for the design of anticoronaviral compounds. Benzotriazole esters have been reported as potent nonpeptidic inhibitors of the enzyme, but their exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV M(pro), the active-site cysteine of which has been acylated by benzotriazole esters that act as suicide inhibitors. In one of the structures, the thioester product has been hydrolyzed and benzoic acid is observed to bind to the hydrophobic S2 pocket. This structure also features the enzyme with a shortened N-terminal segment ("amputated N finger"). The results further the understanding of the important role of the N finger for catalysis as well as the design of benzotriazole inhibitors with improved specificity.</p>

<p>Formyl-coenzyme A transferase from Oxalobacter formigenes belongs to the Class III coenzyme A transferase family and catalyzes the reversible transfer of a CoA carrier between formyl-CoA and oxalate, forming oxalyl-CoA and formate. Formyl-CoA transferase has a unique three-dimensional fold composed of two interlaced subunits locked together like rings of a chain. We here present an intermediate in the reaction, formyl-CoA transferase containing the covalent beta-aspartyl-CoA thioester, adopting different conformations in the two active sites of the dimer, which was identified through crystallographic freeze-trapping experiments with formyl-CoA and oxalyl-CoA in the absence of acceptor carboxylic acid. The formation of the enzyme-CoA thioester was also confirmed by mass spectrometric data. Further structural data include a trapped aspartyl-formyl anhydride protected by a glycine loop closing down over the active site. In a crystal structure of the beta-aspartyl-CoA thioester of an inactive mutant variant, oxalate was found bound to the open conformation of the glycine loop. Together with hydroxylamine trapping experiments and kinetic as well as mutagenesis data, the structures of these formyl-CoA transferase complexes provide new information on the Class III CoA-transferase family and prompt redefinition of the catalytic steps and the modified reaction mechanism of formyl-CoA transferase proposed here.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase from two yeast species is activated allosterically has been elucidated. A total of seven three-dimensional structures of the enzyme, of enzyme variants, or of enzyme complexes from two yeast species, three of them reported here for the first time, provide detailed atomic resolution snapshots along the activation coordinate. The prime event is the covalent binding of the substrate pyruvate to the side chain of cysteine 221, thus forming a thiohemiketal. This reaction causes the shift of a neighboring amino acid, which eventually leads to the rigidification of two otherwise flexible loops, one of which provides two histidine residues necessary to complete the enzymatically competent active site architecture. The structural data are complemented and supported by kinetic investigations and binding studies, providing a consistent picture of the structural changes occurring upon enzyme activation.</p>

<p>The yfdXWUVE operon appears to encode proteins that enhance the ability of Escherichia coli MG1655 to survive under acidic conditions. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic behavior remain to be elucidated, findings from structural genomic studies have shown that the structure of YfdW, the protein encoded by the yfdW gene, is homologous to that of the enzyme that mediates oxalate catabolism in the obligate anaerobe Oxalobacter formigenes, O. formigenes formyl coenzyme A transferase (FRC). We now report the first detailed examination of the steady-state kinetic behavior and substrate specificity of recombinant, wild-type YfdW. Our studies confirm that YfdW is a formyl coenzyme A (formyl-CoA) transferase, and YfdW appears to be more stringent than the corresponding enzyme (FRC) in Oxalobacter in employing formyl-CoA and oxalate as substrates. We also report the effects of replacing Trp-48 in the FRC active site with the glutamine residue that occupies an equivalent position in the E. coli protein. The results of these experiments show that Trp-48 precludes oxalate binding to a site that mediates substrate inhibition for YfdW. In addition, the replacement of Trp-48 by Gln-48 yields an FRC variant for which oxalate-dependent substrate inhibition is modified to resemble that seen for YfdW. Our findings illustrate the utility of structural homology in assigning enzyme function and raise the question of whether oxalate catabolism takes place in E. coli upon the up-regulation of the yfdXWUVE operon under acidic conditions.</p>

<p>Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by organophosphorus compounds (OPs) such as pesticides and nerve agents causes acute toxicity or death of the intoxicated individual. The inhibited AChE may be reactivated by certain oximes as antidotes for clinical treatment of OP-intoxications. Crystal structures of the oximes HI-6, Ortho-7 and obidoxime in complex with Mus musculus acetylcholinesterase (mAChE) reveal different roles of the peripheral anionic site (PAS) in the binding of the oximes. A limited structural change of the side chains of Trp286 and Asp74 facilitates the intercalation of the 4-carboxylamide pyridinium ring of HI-6 between the side chains of Tyr124 and Trp286. The 2-carboxyimino pyridinium ring of HI-6 is accommodated at the entrance of the catalytic site with the oximate forming a hydrogen bond to the main-chain nitrogen atom of Phe295. In contrast to HI-6, the coordination of Ortho-7 and obidoxime within the PAS is facilitated by an extended structural change of Trp286 that allows one of the carboxyimino pyridinium rings to form a cation-pi interaction with the aromatic groups of Tyr72 and Trp286. The central chain of Ortho-7 and obidoxime is loosely coordinated in the active-site gorge, whereas the second carboxyimino pyridinium ring is accommodated in the vicinity of the phenol ring of Tyr337. The structural data clearly show analogous coordination of Ortho-7 and obidoxime within the active-site gorge of AChE. Different ability to reactivate AChE inhibited by tabun is shown in end-point reactivation experiments where HI-6, Ortho-7 and obidoxime showed an efficiency of 1, 45 and 38%, respectively. The low efficiency of HI-6 and the significantly higher efficiency of Ortho-7 and obidoxime may be explained by the differential binding of the oximes in the PAS and active-site gorge of AChE.</p>

<p>The first step of the reaction catalyzed by the homodimeric FabH from a dissociated fatty acid synthase is acyl transfer from acyl-CoA to an active site cysteine. We report that C1 to C10 alkyl-CoA disulfides irreversibly inhibit Escherichia coli FabH (ecFabH) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis FabH with relative efficiencies that reflect these enzymes' differential acyl-group specificity. Crystallographic and kinetic studies with MeSSCoA show rapid inhibition of one monomer of ecFabH through formation of a methyl disulfide conjugate with this cysteine. Reaction of the second subunit with either MeSSCoA or acetyl-CoA is much slower. In the presence of malonyl-ACP, the acylation rate of the second subunit is restored to that of the native ecFabH. These observations suggest a catalytic model in which a structurally disordered apo-ecFabH dimer orders on binding either the first substrate, acetyl-CoA, or the inhibitor MeSSCoA, and is restored to a disordered state on binding of malonyl-ACP.</p>

<p>Cellvibrio japonicus arabinanase Arb43A hydrolyzes the alpha-1,5-linked L-arabinofuranoside backbone of plant cell wall arabinans. The three-dimensional structure of Arb43A, determined at 1.9 A resolution, reveals a five-bladed beta-propeller fold. Arb43A is the first enzyme known to display this topology. A long V-shaped surface groove, partially enclosed at one end, forms a single extended substrate-binding surface across the face of the propeller. Three carboxylates deep in the active site groove provide the general acid and base components for glycosidic bond hydrolysis with inversion of anomeric configuration.</p>

<p>Optimization processes, such as evolution, are constrained by diminishing returns-the closer the optimum, the smaller the benefit per mutation, and by tradeoffs-improvement of one property at the cost of others. However, the magnitude and molecular basis of these parameters, and their effect on evolutionary transitions, remain unknown. Here we pursue a complete functional transition of an enzyme with a &gt;10(9)-fold change in the enzyme's selectivity using laboratory evolution. We observed strong diminishing returns, with the initial mutations conferring &gt;25-fold higher improvements than later ones, and asymmetric tradeoffs whereby the gain/loss ratio of the new/old activity decreased 400-fold from the beginning of the trajectory to its end. We describe the molecular basis for these phenomena and suggest they have an important role in shaping natural proteins. These findings also suggest that the catalytic efficiency and specificity of many natural enzymes may be far from their optimum.</p>

<p>HD-domain phosphohydrolases have nucleotidase and phosphodiesterase activities and play important roles in the metabolism of nucleotides and in signaling. We present three 2.1-A-resolution crystal structures (one in the free state and two complexed with natural substrates) of an HD-domain phosphohydrolase, the Escherichia coli 5'-nucleotidase YfbR. The free-state structure of YfbR contains a large cavity accommodating the metal-coordinating HD motif (H33, H68, D69, and D137) and other conserved residues (R18, E72, and D77). Alanine scanning mutagenesis confirms that these residues are important for activity. Two structures of the catalytically inactive mutant E72A complexed with Co(2+) and either thymidine-5'-monophosphate or 2'-deoxyriboadenosine-5'-monophosphate disclose the novel binding mode of deoxyribonucleotides in the active site. Residue R18 stabilizes the phosphate on the Co(2+), and residue D77 forms a strong hydrogen bond critical for binding the ribose. The indole side chain of W19 is located close to the 2'-carbon atom of the deoxyribose moiety and is proposed to act as the selectivity switch for deoxyribonucleotide, which is supported by comparison to YfdR, another 5'-nucleotidase in E. coli. The nucleotide bases of both deoxyriboadenosine-5'-monophosphate and thymidine-5'-monophosphate make no specific hydrogen bonds with the protein, explaining the lack of nucleotide base selectivity. The YfbR E72A substrate complex structures also suggest a plausible single-step nucleophilic substitution mechanism. This is the first proposed molecular mechanism for an HD-domain phosphohydrolase based directly on substrate-bound crystal structures.</p>

<p>As a potential drug to treat neurological diseases, the mechanism-based inhibitor (S)-4-amino-4,5-dihydro-2-furancarboxylic acid (S-ADFA) has been found to inhibit the γ-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT) reaction. To circumvent the difficulties in structural studies of a S-ADFA-enzyme complex using GABA-AT, l-aspartate aminotransferase (l-AspAT) from Escherichia coli was used as a model PLP-dependent enzyme. Crystal structures of the E. coli aspartate aminotransferase with S-ADFA bound to the active site were obtained via cocrystallization at pH 7.5 and 8. The complex structures suggest that S-ADFA inhibits the transamination reaction by forming adducts with the catalytic lysine 246 via a covalent bond while producing 1 equiv of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP). Based on the structures, formation of the K246-S-ADFA adducts requires a specific initial binding configuration of S-ADFA in the l-AspAT active site, as well as deprotonation of the ε-amino group of lysine 246 after the formation of the quinonoid and/or ketimine intermediate in the overall inactivation reaction.</p>

<p>Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), a derivative of vitamin B1, is an enzymatic cofactor whose special chemical properties allow it to play critical mechanistic roles in a number of essential metabolic enzymes. It has been assumed that all ThDP-dependent enzymes exploit a polar interaction between a strictly conserved glutamate and the N1' of the ThDP moiety. The crystal structure of glyoxylate carboligase challenges this paradigm by revealing that valine replaces the conserved glutamate. Through kinetic, spectroscopic and site-directed mutagenesis studies, we show that although this extreme change lowers the rate of the initial step of the enzymatic reaction, it ensures efficient progress through subsequent steps. Glyoxylate carboligase thus provides a unique illustration of the fine tuning between catalytic stages imposed during evolution on enzymes catalyzing multistep processes.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of a novel sulfonyl-pyridazinone inhibitor in complex with aldose reductase, the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, has been determined to 1.43 angstroms and 0.95 angstroms resolution. The ternary complex of inhibitor, cofactor and enzyme has been obtained by soaking of preformed crystals. Supposedly due to low solubility in the crystallisation buffer, in both structures the inhibitor shows reduced occupancy of 74% and 46% population, respectively. The pyridazinone head group of the inhibitor occupies the catalytic site, whereas the chloro-benzofuran moiety penetrates into the opened specificity pocket. The high-resolution structure provides some evidence that the pyridazinone group binds in a negatively charged deprotonated state, whereas the neighbouring His110 residue most likely adopts a neutral uncharged status. Since the latter structure is populated by the ligand to only 46%, a second conformation of the C-terminal ligand-binding region can be detected. This conformation corresponds to the closed state of the specificity pocket when no or only small ligands are bound to aldose reductase. The two conformational states are in good agreement with frames observed along a molecular dynamics trajectory describing the transition from closed to open situation. Accordingly, both geometries, superimposed in the averaged crystal structure, correspond to snapshots of the ligand-bound and the unbound state. Isothermal titration calorimetry has been applied to determine the binding constants of the investigated pyridazinone in comparison to the hydantoin sorbinil and the carboxylate-type inhibitors IDD 594 and tolrestat. The pyridazinone exhibits a binding affinity similar to those of tolrestat and sorbinil, and shows slightly reduced affinity compared to IDD 594. These studies elucidating the binding mode and providing information about protonation states of protein side-chains involved in binding of this novel class of inhibitors establish the platform for further structure-based drug design.</p>

The pyridazinone exhibits a binding affinity similar to those of tolrestat and sorbinil, and shows slightly reduced affinity compared to IDD 594. These studies elucidating the binding mode and providing information about protonation states of protein side-chains involved in binding of this novel class of inhibitors establish the platform for further structure-based drug design.</p>

<p>The copper amine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO) is reversibly inhibited by molecular wires comprising a Ru(II) complex head group and an aromatic tail group joined by an alkane linker. The crystal structures of a series of Ru(II)-wire-AGAO complexes differing with respect to the length of the alkane linker have been determined. All wires lie in the AGAO active-site channel, with their aromatic tail group in contact with the trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor of the enzyme. The TPQ cofactor is consistently in its active ("off-Cu") conformation, and the side chain of the so-called "gate" residue Tyr296 is consistently in the "gate-open" conformation. Among the wires tested, the most stable complex is produced when the wire has a -(CH2)4- linker. In this complex, the Ru(II)(phen)(bpy)2 head group is level with the protein molecular surface. Crystal structures of AGAO in complex with optically pure forms of the C4 wire show that the linker and head group in the two enantiomers occupy slightly different positions in the active-site channel. Both the Lambda and Delta isomers are effective competitive inhibitors of amine oxidation. Remarkably, inhibition by the C4 wire shows a high degree of selectivity for AGAO in comparison with other copper-containing amine oxidases.</p>

<p>The structures of F(1)-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria inhibited with the dietary phytopolyphenol, resveratrol, and with the related polyphenols quercetin and piceatannol have been determined at 2.3-, 2.4- and 2.7-A resolution, respectively. The inhibitors bind to a common site in the inside surface of an annulus made from loops in the three alpha- and three beta-subunits beneath the "crown" of beta-strands in their N-terminal domains. This region of F(1)-ATPase forms a bearing to allow the rotation of the tip of the gamma-subunit inside the annulus during catalysis. The binding site is a hydrophobic pocket between the C-terminal tip of the gamma-subunit and the beta(TP) subunit, and the inhibitors are bound via H-bonds mostly to their hydroxyl moieties mediated by bound water molecules and by hydrophobic interactions. There are no equivalent sites between the gamma-subunit and either the beta(DP) or the beta(E) subunit. The inhibitors probably prevent both the synthetic and hydrolytic activities of the enzyme by blocking both senses of rotation of the gamma-subunit. The beneficial effects of dietary resveratrol may derive in part by preventing mitochondrial ATP synthesis in tumor cells, thereby inducing apoptosis.</p>

<p>N(10) -formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) is a folate enzyme that catalyzes the formylation of tetrahydrofolate (THF) in an ATP dependent manner. Structures of FTHFS from the thermophilic homoacetogen, Moorella thermoacetica, complexed with (1) a catalytic intermediate-formylphosphate (XPO) and product-ADP; (2) with an inhibitory substrate analog-folate; (3) with XPO and an inhibitory THF analog, ZD9331, were used to analyze the enzyme mechanism. Nucleophilic attack of the formate ion on the gamma phosphate of ATP leads to the formation of XPO and the first product ADP. A channel that leads to the putative formate binding pocket allows for the binding of ATP and formate in random order. Formate binding is due to interactions with the gamma-phosphate moiety of ATP and additionally to two hydrogen bonds from the backbone nitrogen of Ala276 and the side chain of Arg97. Upon ADP dissociation, XPO reorients and moves to the position previously occupied by the beta-phosphate of ATP. Conformational changes that occur due to the XPO presence apparently allow for the recruitment of the third substrate, THF, with its pterin moiety positioned between Phe384 and Trp412. This position overlaps with that of the bound nucleoside, which is consistent with a catalytic mechanism hypothesis that FTHFS works via a sequential ping-pong mechanism. More specifically, a random bi uni uni bi ping-pong ter ter mechanism is proposed. Additionally, the native structure originally reported at a 2.5 Å resolution was redetermined at a 2.2 Å resolution.</p>

<p>Photosynthetic organisms can store nitrogen by synthesizing arginine, and, therefore, feedback inhibition of arginine synthesis must be relieved in these organisms when nitrogen is abundant. This relief is accomplished by the binding of the PII signal transduction protein to acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK), the controlling enzyme of arginine synthesis. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the complex between NAGK and PII of Synechococcus elongatus, at 2.75-A resolution. We prove the physiological relevance of the observed interactions by site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies. The complex consists of two polar PII trimers sandwiching one ring-like hexameric NAGK (a trimer of dimers) with the threefold axes of these molecules aligned. The binding of PII favors a narrow ring conformation of the NAGK hexamer that is associated with arginine sites having low affinity for this inhibitor. Each PII subunit contacts one NAGK subunit only. The contacts map in the inner circumference of the NAGK ring and involve two surfaces of the PII subunit. One surface is on the PII body and interacts with the C-domain of the NAGK subunit, helping widen the arginine site found on the other side of this domain. The other surface is at the distal region of a protruding large loop (T-loop) that presents a novel compact shape. This loop is inserted in the interdomain crevice of the NAGK subunit, contacting mainly the N-domain, and playing key roles in anchoring PII on NAGK, in activating NAGK, and in complex formation regulation by MgATP, ADP, 2-oxoglutarate, and by phosphorylation of serine-49.</p>

<p>8-hydroxy-4-methyl-9-nitrobenzo(g)chromen-2-one (NBC) has been found to be a fairly potent ATP site-directed inhibitor of protein kinase CK2 (Ki = 0.22 μM). Here, we show that NBC also inhibits PIM kinases, especially PIM1 and PIM3, the latter as potently as CK2. Upon removal of the nitro group, to give 8-hydroxy-4-methyl-benzo(g)chromen-2-one (here referred to as "denitro NBC", dNBC), the inhibitory power toward CK2 is almost entirely lost (IC(50) &gt; 30 μM) whereas that toward PIM1 and PIM3 is maintained; in addition, dNBC is a potent inhibitor of a number of other kinases that are weakly inhibited or unaffected by NBC, with special reference to DYRK1A whose IC(50) values with NBC and dNBC are 15 and 0.60 μM, respectively. Therefore, the observation that NBC, unlike dNBC, is a potent inducer of apoptosis is consistent with the notion that this effect is mediated by inhibition of endogenous CK2. The structural features underlying NBC selectivity have been revealed by inspecting its 3D structure in complex with the catalytic subunit of Z. mays CK2. The crucial role of the nitro group is exerted both through a direct electrostatic interaction with the side chain of Lys68 and, indirectly, by enhancing the acidic dissociation constant of the adjacent hydroxyl group which interacts with a conserved water molecule in the deepest part of the cavity. By contrast, the very same nitro group is deleterious for the binding to the active site of DYRK1A, as disclosed by molecular docking. This provides the rationale for preferential inhibition of DYRK1A by dNBC.</p>

<p>The mature HIV-1 protease (PR) bearing the L76V drug resistance mutation (PR(L76V)) is significantly less stable, with a &gt;7-fold higher dimer dissociation constant (K(d)) of 71 ± 24 nM and twice the sensitivity to urea denaturation (UC(50) = 0.85 M) relative to those of PR. Differential scanning calorimetry showed decreases in T(m) of 12 °C for PR(L76V) in the absence of inhibitors and 5-7 °C in the presence of inhibitors darunavir (DRV), saquinavir (SQV), and lopinavir (LPV), relative to that of PR. Isothermal titration calorimetry gave a ligand dissociation constant of 0.8 nM for DRV, ∼160-fold higher than that of PR, consistent with DRV resistance. Crystal structures of PR(L76V) in complexes with DRV and SQV were determined at resolutions of 1.45-1.46 Å. Compared to the corresponding PR complexes, the mutated Val76 lacks hydrophobic interactions with Asp30, Lys45, Ile47, and Thr74 and exhibits closer interactions with Val32 and Val56. The bound DRV lacks one hydrogen bond with the main chain of Asp30 in PR(L76V) relative to PR, possibly accounting for the resistance to DRV. SQV shows slightly improved polar interactions with PR(L76V) compared to those with PR. Although the L76V mutation significantly slows the N-terminal autoprocessing of the precursor TFR-PR(L76V) to give rise to the mature PR(L76V), the coselected M46I mutation counteracts the effect by enhancing this rate but renders the TFR-PR(M46I/L76V) precursor less responsive to inhibition by 6 μM LPV while preserving inhibition by SQV and DRV. The correlation of lowered stability, higher K(d), and impaired autoprocessing with reduced internal hydrophobic contacts suggests a novel molecular mechanism for drug resistance.</p>

<p>Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of guanine in the wobble position of particular tRNAs by the modified base preQ(1). In vitro, however, the enzyme is also able to insert the immediate biosynthetic precursor, preQ(0), into those tRNAs. This substrate promiscuity is based on a peptide switch in the active site, gated by the general acid/base Glu235. The switch alters the properties of the binding pocket to allow either the accommodation of guanine or preQ(1). The peptide conformer recognising guanine, however, is also able to bind preQ(0). To investigate selectivity regulation, kinetic data for Zymomonas mobilis Tgt were recorded. They show that selectivity in favour of the actual substrate preQ(1) over preQ(0) is not achieved by a difference in affinity but via a higher turnover rate. Moreover, a Tgt(Glu235Gln) variant was constructed. The mutation was intended to stabilise the peptide switch in the conformation favouring guanine and preQ(0) binding. Kinetic characterisation of the mutated enzyme revealed that the Glu235Gln exchange has, with respect to all substrate bases, no significant influence on k(cat). In contrast, K(M)(preQ(1)) is drastically increased, while K(M)(preQ(0)) seems to be decreased. Hence, regarding k(cat)/K(M) as an indicator for catalytic efficiency, selectivity of Tgt in favour of preQ(1) is abolished or even inverted in favour of preQ(0) for Tgt(Glu235Gln). Crystal structures of the mutated enzyme confirm that the mutation strongly favours the binding pocket conformation required for the accommodation of guanine and preQ(0). The way this is achieved, however, significantly differs from that predicted based on crystal structures of wild-type Tgt.</p>

<p>The aspartate biosynthetic pathway provides essential metabolites for many important biological functions, including the production of four essential amino acids. As this critical pathway is only present in plants and microbes, any disruptions will be fatal to these organisms. An early pathway enzyme, l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, produces a key intermediate at the first branch point of this pathway. Developing potent and selective inhibitors against several orthologs in the l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase family can serve as lead compounds for antibiotic development. Kinetic studies of two small molecule fragment libraries have identified inhibitors that show good selectivity against l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenases from two different bacterial species, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Vibrio cholerae, despite the presence of an identical constellation of active site amino acids in this homologous enzyme family. Structural characterization of enzyme-inhibitor complexes have elucidated different modes of binding between these structurally related enzymes. This information provides the basis for a structure-guided approach to the development of more potent and more selective inhibitors.</p>

<p>Laminarinase is commonly used to describe β-1,3-glucanases widespread throughout Archaea, bacteria, and several eukaryotic lineages. Some β-1,3-glucanases have already been structurally and biochemically characterized, but very few from organisms that are in contact with genuine laminarin, the storage polysaccharide of brown algae. Here we report the heterologous expression and subsequent biochemical and structural characterization of ZgLamAGH16 from Zobellia galactanivorans, the first GH16 laminarinase from a marine bacterium associated with seaweeds. ZgLamAGH16 contains a unique additional loop, compared with other GH16 laminarinases, which is composed of 17 amino acids and gives a bent shape to the active site cleft of the enzyme. This particular topology is perfectly adapted to the U-shaped conformation of laminarin chains in solution and thus explains the predominant specificity of ZgLamAGH16 for this substrate. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and two enzyme-substrate complexes, one with laminaritetraose and the other with a trisaccharide of 1,3-1,4-β-d-glucan, have been determined at 1.5, 1.35, and 1.13 Å resolution, respectively. The structural comparison of substrate recognition pattern between these complexes allows the proposition that ZgLamAGH16 likely diverged from an ancestral broad specificity GH16 β-glucanase and evolved toward a bent active site topology adapted to efficient degradation of algal laminarin. </p>

<p>Enzymes possessing catalytic zinc centers perform a variety of fundamental processes in nature, including methyl transfer to thiols. Cobalamin-independent (MetE) and cobalamin-dependent (MetH) methionine synthases are two such enzyme families. Although they perform the same net reaction, transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine (Hcy) to form methionine, they display markedly different catalytic strategies, modular organization, and active site zinc centers. Here we report crystal structures of zinc-replete MetE and MetH, both in the presence and absence of Hcy. Structural investigation of the catalytic zinc sites of these two methyltransferases reveals an unexpected inversion of zinc geometry upon binding of Hcy and displacement of an endogenous ligand in both enzymes. In both cases a significant movement of the zinc relative to the protein scaffold accompanies inversion. These structures provide new information on the activation of thiols by zinc-containing enzymes and have led us to propose a paradigm for the mechanism of action of the catalytic zinc sites in these and related methyltransferases. Specifically, zinc is mobile in the active sites of MetE and MetH, and its dynamic nature helps facilitate the active site conformational changes necessary for thiol activation and methyl transfer.</p>

<p>The three-dimensional structures of Escherichia coli glycerol kinase (GK) with bound glycerol in the presence and absence of one of the allosteric regulators of its activity, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), at 3.2 and 3.0 A, are presented. The molecule crystallized in space group P41212, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement. The models were refined with good stereochemistry to final R-factors of 21.1 and 21.9%, respectively. A tetrameric arrangement of monomers was observed which was essentially identical to the proposed inactive tetramer II previously described [Feese, M. D., Faber, H. R., Bystrom, C. E., Pettigrew, D. W., and Remington, S. J. (1998) Structure (in press)]. However, the crystal packing in this form was especially open, permitting the FBP binding site to be occupied and identified. The crystallographic data revealed a most unusual type of FBP binding site formed between two glycine-arginine loops (residues 234-236) where one-half of the binding site is donated by each monomer at the regulatory interface. The molecule of FBP binds in two mutually exclusive modes on a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis at 50% occupancy each; thus, a tetramer of GK binds two molecules of FBP. Ionic interactions between the 1- and 6-phosphates of FBP and Arg 236 were observed in addition to hydrogen bonding interactions between the backbone amide of Gly 234 and the 6-phosphate. No contacts between the protein and the furanose ring were observed. Mutagenesis of Arg 236 to alanine drastically reduced the extent of inhibition of GK by FBP and lowered, but did not eliminate, the ability of FBP to promote tetramer association. These observations are consistent with the previously characterized mechanism of FBP inhibition of GK, in which FBP acts both to promote dimer-tetramer assembly and to inactivate the tetramers.</p>

<p>3-Oxo-acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabG) plays a key role in the bacterial fatty acid synthesis II system in pathogenic microorganisms, which has been recognized as a potential drug target. FabG catalyzes reduction of a 3-oxo-acyl-ACP intermediate during the elongation cycle of fatty acid biosynthesis. Here, we report gene deletion experiments that support the essentiality of this gene in P. aeruginosa and the identification of a number of small molecule FabG inhibitors with IC50 values in the nanomolar to low micromolar range and good physicochemical properties. Structural characterization of 16 FabG-inhibitor complexes by X-ray crystallography revealed that the compounds bind at a novel allosteric site located at the FabG subunit-subunit interface. Inhibitor binding relies primarily on hydrophobic interactions, but specific hydrogen bonds are also observed. Importantly, the binding cavity is formed upon complex formation and therefore would not be recognized by virtual screening approaches. The structure analysis further reveals that the inhibitors act by inducing conformational changes that propagate to the active site, resulting in a displacement of the catalytic triad and the inability to bind NADPH. </p>

<p>The Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A light chain (BoNT/A-LC) is a Zn(II)-dependent metalloprotease that blocks the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by cleaving SNAP-25, one of the SNARE proteins required for exocytosis. Because of the potential for use of the toxin in bioterrorism and the increasingly widespread application of the toxin in the medical field, there is significant interest in the development of small-molecule inhibitors of the metalloprotease. Efforts to design such inhibitors have not benefited from knowledge of how peptides bind to the active site since the enzyme-peptide structures available previously either were not occupied in the vicinity of the catalytic Zn(II) ion or did not represent the product of SNAP-25 substrate cleavage. Herein we report the 1.4 A-resolution X-ray crystal structure of a complex between the BoNT/A-LC and the inhibitory peptide N-Ac-CRATKML, the first structure of the light chain with an inhibitory peptide bound at the catalytic Zn(II) ion. The peptide is bound with the Cys S gamma atom coordinating the metal ion. Surprisingly, the cysteine sulfur is oxidized to the sulfenic acid form. Given the unstable nature of this species in solution, is it likely that oxidation occurs on the enzyme. In addition to the peptide-bound structure, we report two structures of the unliganded light chain with and without the Zn(II) cofactor bound at 1.25 and 1.20 A resolution, respectively. The two structures are nearly identical, confirming that the Zn(II) ion plays a purely catalytic role. Additionally, the structure of the Zn(II)-bound uncomplexed enzyme allows identification of the catalytic water molecule and a second water molecule that occupies the same position as the peptidic oxygen in the tetrahedral intermediate. This observation suggests that the enzyme active site is prearranged to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate of the protease reaction.</p>

<p>Type II dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a plasmid-encoded enzyme that confers resistance to bacterial DHFR-targeted antifolate drugs. It forms a symmetric homotetramer with a central pore which functions as the active site. Its unusual structure, which results in a promiscuous binding surface that accommodates either the dihydrofolate (DHF) substrate or the NADPH cofactor, has constituted a significant limitation to efforts to understand its substrate specificity and reaction mechanism. We describe here the first structure of a ternary R67 DHFR.DHF.NADP+ catalytic complex, resolved to 1.26 A. This structure provides the first clear picture of how this enzyme, which lacks the active site carboxyl residue that is ubiquitous in Type I DHFRs, is able to function. In the catalytic complex, the polar backbone atoms of two symmetry-related I68 residues provide recognition motifs that interact with the carboxamide on the nicotinamide ring, and the N3-O4 amide function on the pteridine ring. This set of interactions orients the aromatic rings of substrate and cofactor in a relative endo geometry in which the reactive centers are held in close proximity. Additionally, a central, hydrogen-bonded network consisting of two pairs of Y69-Q67-Q67'-Y69' residues provides an unusually tight interface, which appears to serve as a "molecular clamp" holding the substrates in place in an orientation conducive to hydride transfer. In addition to providing the first clear insight regarding how this extremely unusual enzyme is able to function, the structure of the ternary complex provides general insights into how a mutationally challenged enzyme, i.e., an enzyme whose evolution is restricted to four-residues-at-a-time active site mutations, overcomes this fundamental limitation.</p>

<p>While the selection of amino acid insertions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) is a known mechanism of resistance against RT inhibitors, very few reports on the selection of insertions in the protease (PR) coding region have been published. It is still unclear whether these insertions impact protease inhibitor (PI) resistance and/or viral replication capacity. We show that the prevalence of insertions, especially between amino acids 30 to 41 of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) PR, has increased in recent years. We identified amino acid insertions at positions 33 and 35 of the PR of HIV-1-infected patients who had undergone prolonged treatment with PIs, and we characterized the contribution of these insertions to viral resistance. We prepared the corresponding mutated, recombinant PR variants with or without insertions at positions 33 and 35 and characterized them in terms of enzyme kinetics and crystal structures. We also engineered the corresponding recombinant viruses and analyzed the PR susceptibility and replication capacity by recombinant virus assay. Both in vitro methods confirmed that the amino acid insertions at positions 33 and 35 contribute to the viral resistance to most of the tested PIs. The structural analysis revealed local structural rearrangements in the flap region and in the substrate binding pockets. The enlargement of the PR substrate binding site together with impaired flap dynamics could account for the weaker inhibitor binding by the insertion mutants. Amino acid insertions in the vicinity of the binding cleft therefore represent a novel mechanism of HIV resistance development.</p>

<p>The mechanisms of molecular recognition of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and oxaloacetate (OAA) by cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (cPEPCK) were investigated by the systematic evaluation of a variety of PEP and OAA analogues as potential reversible inhibitors of the enzyme against PEP. The molecules that inhibit the enzyme in a competitive fashion were found to fall into two general classes. Those molecules that mimic the binding geometry of PEP, namely phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphonopropionate, are found to bind weakly (millimolar Ki values). In contrast, those competitive inhibitors that mimic the binding of OAA (oxalate and phosphonoformate) coordinate directly to the active site manganese ion and bind an order of magnitude more tightly (micromolar Ki values). The competitive inhibitor sulfoacetate is found to be an outlier of these two classes, binding in a hybrid fashion utilizing modes of recognition of both PEP and OAA in order to achieve a micromolar inhibition constant in the absence of direct coordination to the active site metal. The kinetic studies in combination with the structural characterization of the five aforementioned competitive inhibitors demonstrate the molecular requirements for high affinity binding of molecules to the active site of the enzyme. These features include cis-planar carbonyl groups that are required for coordination to the active site metal, a bridging electron rich atom at the position corresponding to the C2 methylene group of OAA to facilitate interactions with R405, a carboxylate or sulfonate moiety at a position corresponding to the C1 carboxylate of OAA, and the edge-on aromatic interaction between a carboxylate and Y235.</p>

<p>Potential dioxygen-binding sites in three Cu amine oxidases have been investigated by recording X-ray diffraction data at 1.7-2.2A resolution for crystals under a high pressure of xenon gas. Electron-density difference maps and crystallographic refinement provide unequivocal evidence for a number of Xe-binding sites in each enzyme. Only one of these sites is present in all three Cu amine oxidases studied. Structural changes elsewhere in the protein molecules are insignificant. The results illustrate the use of xenon as a probe for cavities, in which a protein may accommodate a dioxygen molecule. The finding of a potential dioxygen-binding cavity close to the active site of Cu amine oxidases may be relevant to the function of the enzymes, since the formation of a transient protein-dioxygen complex is a likely step in the catalytic mechanism. No evidence was found for xenon binding in a region of the molecule that was previously identified in two other Cu amine oxidases as a potential transient dioxygen-binding site.</p>

<p>In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the expression of a number of virulence factors, as well as biofilm formation, are controlled by quorum sensing (QS). N-Acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are an important class of signaling molecules involved in bacterial QS and in many pathogenic bacteria infection and host colonization are AHL-dependent. The AHL signaling molecules are subject to inactivation mainly by hydrolases (Enzyme Commission class number EC 3) (i.e. N-acyl-homoserine lactonases and N-acyl-homoserine-lactone acylases). Only little is known on quorum quenching mechanisms of oxidoreductases (EC 1). Here we report on the identification and structural characterization of the first NADP-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) involved in inactivation of N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C(12)-HSL) and derived from a metagenome library. The corresponding gene was isolated from a soil metagenome and designated bpiB09. Heterologous expression and crystallographic studies established BpiB09 as an NADP-dependent reductase. Although AHLs are probably not the native substrate of this metagenome-derived enzyme, its expression in P. aeruginosa PAO1 resulted in significantly reduced pyocyanin production, decreased motility, poor biofilm formation and absent paralysis of Caenorhabditis elegans. Furthermore, a genome-wide transcriptome study suggested that the level of lasI and rhlI transcription together with 36 well known QS regulated genes was significantly (≥10-fold) affected in P. aeruginosa strains expressing the bpiB09 gene in pBBR1MCS-5. Thus AHL oxidoreductases could be considered as potent tools for the development of quorum quenching strategies.</p>

<p>Type II dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a plasmid-encoded enzyme that confers resistance to bacterial DHFR-targeted antifolate drugs. It forms a symmetric homotetramer with a central pore which functions as the active site. Its unusual structure, which results in a promiscuous binding surface that accommodates either the dihydrofolate (DHF) substrate or the NADPH cofactor, has constituted a significant limitation to efforts to understand its substrate specificity and reaction mechanism. We describe here the first structure of a ternary R67 DHFR.DHF.NADP+ catalytic complex, resolved to 1.26 A. This structure provides the first clear picture of how this enzyme, which lacks the active site carboxyl residue that is ubiquitous in Type I DHFRs, is able to function. In the catalytic complex, the polar backbone atoms of two symmetry-related I68 residues provide recognition motifs that interact with the carboxamide on the nicotinamide ring, and the N3-O4 amide function on the pteridine ring. This set of interactions orients the aromatic rings of substrate and cofactor in a relative endo geometry in which the reactive centers are held in close proximity. Additionally, a central, hydrogen-bonded network consisting of two pairs of Y69-Q67-Q67'-Y69' residues provides an unusually tight interface, which appears to serve as a "molecular clamp" holding the substrates in place in an orientation conducive to hydride transfer. In addition to providing the first clear insight regarding how this extremely unusual enzyme is able to function, the structure of the ternary complex provides general insights into how a mutationally challenged enzyme, i.e., an enzyme whose evolution is restricted to four-residues-at-a-time active site mutations, overcomes this fundamental limitation.</p>

<p>While the selection of amino acid insertions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) is a known mechanism of resistance against RT inhibitors, very few reports on the selection of insertions in the protease (PR) coding region have been published. It is still unclear whether these insertions impact protease inhibitor (PI) resistance and/or viral replication capacity. We show that the prevalence of insertions, especially between amino acids 30 to 41 of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) PR, has increased in recent years. We identified amino acid insertions at positions 33 and 35 of the PR of HIV-1-infected patients who had undergone prolonged treatment with PIs, and we characterized the contribution of these insertions to viral resistance. We prepared the corresponding mutated, recombinant PR variants with or without insertions at positions 33 and 35 and characterized them in terms of enzyme kinetics and crystal structures.

The enlargement of the PR substrate binding site together with impaired flap dynamics could account for the weaker inhibitor binding by the insertion mutants. Amino acid insertions in the vicinity of the binding cleft therefore represent a novel mechanism of HIV resistance development.</p>

<p>3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P) is the phosphorylated precursor of KDO, an essential sugar of the lipopolysaccharide of Gram negative bacteria. KDO8P is produced by a specific synthase (KDO8PS) by condensing arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), with release of inorganic phosphate. As KDO8PS is present in bacteria and plants, but not in mammalian cells, and mutations that inactivate KDO8PS also block cell replication, KDO8PS is a promising target for the design of new antimicrobials that act by blocking lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that a compound mimicking an intermediate of the condensation reaction is a good ligand and a powerful inhibitor. Here we report on the crystallographic investigation of the binding to KDO8PS of new derivatives of this original inhibitor. The structures of the enzyme in complex with these compounds, and also with the PEP analogs, 2-phosphoglyceric acid (2-PGA) and Z-methyl-PEP, point to future strategies for the design of novel inhibitors of KDO8PS.</p>

<p>The ultimate step common to almost all DNA repair pathways is the ligation of the nicked intermediate to form contiguous double-stranded DNA. In the mammalian nucleotide and base excision repair pathways, the ligation step is carried out by ligase III-α. For efficient ligation, ligase III-α is constitutively bound to the scaffolding protein XRCC1 through interactions between the C-terminal BRCT domains of each protein. Although structural data for the individual domains has been available, no structure of the complex has been determined and several alternative proposals for this interaction have been advanced. Interpretation of the models is complicated by the formation of homodimers that, depending on the model, may either contribute to, or compete with heterodimer formation. We report here the structures of both homodimer complexes as well as the heterodimer complex. Structural characterization of the heterodimer formed from a longer XRCC1 BRCT domain construct, including residues comprising the interdomain linker region, revealed an expanded heterodimer interface with the ligase III-α BRCT domain. This enhanced linker-mediated binding interface plays a significant role in the determination of heterodimer/homodimer selectivity. These data provide fundamental insights into the structural basis of BRCT-mediated dimerization, and resolve questions related to the organization of this important repair complex.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of two orthologs of the regulatory subunit of acetohydroxyacid synthase III (AHAS, EC 2.2.1.6) from Thermotoga maritima (TM0549) and Nitrosomonas europea (NE1324) were determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods with the use of selenomethionine derivatives at 2.3 A and 2.5 A, respectively. TM0549 and NE1324 share the same fold, and in both proteins the polypeptide chain contains two separate domains of a similar size. Each protein contains a C-terminal domain with ferredoxin-type fold and an N-terminal ACT domain, of which the latter is characteristic for several proteins involved in amino acid metabolism. The ferredoxin domain is stabilized by a calcium ion in the crystal structure of NE1324 and by a Mg(H2O)(6)2+ ion in TM0549. Both TM0549 and NE1324 form dimeric assemblies in the crystal lattice.</p>

<p>Crystallography driven optimisation of a lead derived from similarity searching of the GSK compound collection resulted in the discovery of quinoline-3-carboxamides as highly potent and selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4B. This series has been optimized to GSK256066, a potent PDE4B inhibitor which also inhibits LPS induced production of TNF-alpha from isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a pIC(50) of 11.1. GSK256066 also has a suitable profile for inhaled dosing.</p>

<p>It is unclear how cancer cells coordinate glycolysis and biosynthesis to support rapidly growing tumors. We found that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), commonly upregulated in human cancers due to loss of TP53, contributes to biosynthesis regulation in part by controlling intracellular levels of its substrate, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), and product, 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG). 3-PG binds to and inhibits 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), while 2-PG activates 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase to provide feedback control of 3-PG levels. Inhibition of PGAM1 by shRNA or a small molecule inhibitor PGMI-004A results in increased 3-PG and decreased 2-PG levels in cancer cells, leading to significantly decreased glycolysis, PPP flux and biosynthesis, as well as attenuated cell proliferation and tumor growth.</p>

<p>Arginine kinase catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphoryl group between ATP and l-arginine and is a monomeric homolog of the human enzyme creatine kinase. Arginine and creatine kinases belongs to the phosphagen kinase family of enzymes, which consists of eight known members, each of which is specific for its own phosphagen. Here, the source of phosphagen specificity in arginine kinase is investigated through the use of phosphagen analogs. Crystal structures have been determined for Limulus polyphemus arginine kinase with one of four arginine analogs bound in a transition state analog complex: l-ornithine, l-citrulline, imino-l-ornithine, and d-arginine. In all complexes, the enzyme achieves a closed conformation very similar to that of the cognate transition state analog complex, but differences are observed in the configurations of bound ligands. Arginine kinase exhibits no detectable activity towards ornithine, citrulline, or imino-l-ornithine, and only trace activity towards d-arginine. The crystal structures presented here demonstrate that phosphagen specificity is derived neither from a lock-and-key mechanism nor a modulation of induced-fit conformational changes, but potentially from subtle distortions in bound substrate configurations.</p>

<p>DYRKs (dual specificity, tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinases) and CLKs (cdc2-like kinases) are implicated in the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. The marine sponge alkaloid leucettamine B was recently identified as an inhibitor of DYRKs/CLKs. Synthesis of analogues (leucettines) led to an optimized product, leucettine L41. Leucettines were cocrystallized with DYRK1A, DYRK2, CLK3, PIM1, and GSK-3β. The selectivity of L41 was studied by activity and interaction assays of recombinant kinases and affinity chromatography and competition affinity assays. These approaches revealed unexpected potential secondary targets such as CK2, SLK, and the lipid kinase PIKfyve/Vac14/Fig4. L41 displayed neuroprotective effects on glutamate-induced HT22 cell death. L41 also reduced amyloid precursor protein-induced cell death in cultured rat brain slices. The unusual multitarget selectivity of leucettines may account for their neuroprotective effects. This family of kinase inhibitors deserves further optimization as potential therapeutics against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>The human cytosolic sulfotransfases (hSULTs) comprise a family of 12 phase II enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs and hormones, the bioactivation of carcinogens, and the detoxification of xenobiotics. Knowledge of the structural and mechanistic basis of substrate specificity and activity is crucial for understanding steroid and hormone metabolism, drug sensitivity, pharmacogenomics, and response to environmental toxins. We have determined the crystal structures of five hSULTs for which structural information was lacking, and screened nine of the 12 hSULTs for binding and activity toward a panel of potential substrates and inhibitors, revealing unique "chemical fingerprints" for each protein. The family-wide analysis of the screening and structural data provides a comprehensive, high-level view of the determinants of substrate binding, the mechanisms of inhibition by substrates and environmental toxins, and the functions of the orphan family members SULT1C3 and SULT4A1. Evidence is provided for structural "priming" of the enzyme active site by cofactor binding, which influences the spectrum of small molecules that can bind to each enzyme. The data help explain substrate promiscuity in this family and, at the same time, reveal new similarities between hSULT family members that were previously unrecognized by sequence or structure comparison alone.</p>

<p>Burkholderia pseudomallei is a soil-dwelling bacterium endemic to Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Burkholderia is responsible for melioidosis, a serious infection of the skin. The enzyme 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) catalyzes the interconversion of 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate, a key step in the glycolytic pathway. As such it is an extensively studied enzyme and X-ray crystal structures of PGAM enzymes from multiple species have been elucidated. Vanadate is a phosphate mimic that is a powerful tool for studying enzymatic mechanisms in phosphoryl-transfer enzymes such as phosphoglycerate mutase. However, to date no X-ray crystal structures of phosphoglycerate mutase have been solved with vanadate acting as a substrate mimic. Here, two vanadate complexes together with an ensemble of substrate and fragment-bound structures that provide a comprehensive picture of the function of the Burkholderia enzyme are reported.</p>

<p>Dihydroorotase (DHOase) catalyzes the reversible cyclization of N-carbamyl-l-aspartate (CA-asp) to l-dihydroorotate (DHO) in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Two different conformations of the surface loop (residues 105-115) were found in the dimeric Escherichia coli DHOase crystallized in the presence of DHO (PDB code 1XGE). The loop asymmetry reflected that of the active site contents of the two subunits: the product, DHO, was bound in the active site of one subunit and the substrate, CA-asp, in the active site of the other. In the substrate- (CA-asp-) bound subunit, the surface loop reaches in toward the active site and makes hydrogen bonds with the bound CA-asp via two threonine residues (Thr109 and Thr110), whereas the loop forms part of the surface of the protein in the product- (DHO-) bound subunit. To investigate the relationship between the structural states of this loop and the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, a series of mutant DHOases including deletion of the flexible loop were generated and characterized kinetically and structurally. Disruption of the hydrogen bonds between the surface loop and the substrate results in significant loss of catalytic activity. Furthermore, structures of these mutants with low catalytic activity have no interpretable electron density for parts of the flexible loop. The structure of the mutant (Delta107-116), in which the flexible loop is deleted, shows only small differences in positions of other substrate binding residues and in the binuclear zinc center compared with the native structure, yet the enzyme has negligible activity. The kinetic and structural analyses suggest that Thr109 and Thr110 in the flexible loop provide productive binding of substrate and stabilize the transition-state intermediate, thereby increasing catalytic activity.</p>

<p>The reoccurrence of water molecules in crystal structures of RNase T1 was investigated. Five waters were found to be invariant in RNase T1 as well as in six other related fungal RNases. The structural, dynamical, and functional characteristics of one of these conserved hydration sites (WAT1) were analyzed by protein engineering, X-ray crystallography, and (17)O and 2H nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD). The position of WAT1 and its surrounding hydrogen bond network are unaffected by deletions of two neighboring side chains. In the mutant Thr93Gln, the Gln93N epsilon2 nitrogen replaces WAT1 and participates in a similar hydrogen bond network involving Cys6, Asn9, Asp76, and Thr91. The ability of WAT1 to form four hydrogen bonds may explain why evolution has preserved a water molecule, rather than a side-chain atom, at the center of this intricate hydrogen bond network. Comparison of the (17)O NMRD profiles from wild-type and Thr93Gln RNase T1 yield a mean residence time of 7 ns at 27 degrees C and an orientational order parameter of 0.45. The effects of mutations around WAT1 on the kinetic parameters of RNase T1 are small but significant and probably relate to the dynamics of the active site.</p>

<p>A new screening method using fluorescent correlation spectroscopy was developed to select kinase inhibitors that competitively inhibit the binding of a fluorescently labeled substrate peptide. Using the method, among approximately 700 candidate compounds selected by virtual screening, we identified a novel Pim-1 kinase inhibitor targeting its peptide binding residues. X-ray crystal analysis of the complex structure of Pim-1 with the inhibitor indicated that the inhibitor actually binds to the ATP-binding site and also forms direct interactions with residues (Asp128 and Glu171) that bind the substrate peptide. These interactions, which cause small side-chain movements, seem to affect the binding ability of the fluorescently labeled substrate. The compound inhibited Pim-1 kinase in vitro, with an IC(50) value of 150 nM. Treatment of cultured leukemia cells with the compound reduced the amount of p21 and increased the amount of p27, due to Pim-1 inhibition, and then triggered apoptosis after cell-cycle arrest at the G(1)/S phase. This screening method may be widely applicable for the identification of various new Pim-1 kinase inhibitors targeting the residues that bind the substrate peptide.</p>

<p>Rho-kinase is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cytoskeletal events in cells. The enzyme activity of Rho-kinase is auto-inhibited in the free state but is activated through direct binding to the small GTPase Rho in the GTP-bound form. The crystal structure of the Rho-binding domain (RhoBD) of Rho-kinase has been determined at 1.8-A resolution by the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion technique. The structure shows that RhoBD dimerizes to form a parallel coiled-coil with long consecutive alpha-helices extended to approximately 97 A and suggests that free Rho-kinase can also form a dimer through parallel self-association. At the middle region of the coiled-coil, the polypeptide chains are flexible and display loose "knobs-into-holes" packing of the side chains from both chains. RhoBD residues that have been shown to be critical for Rho-binding are spread in the positively charged C-terminal region. The parallel coiled-coil structure of our Rho-kinase RhoBD in the free form is different from the anti-parallel coiled-coil structure of RhoBD of protein kinase N when complexed with RhoA. Implications derived from these structural studies in relation to the mechanism of Rho-kinase activation will be addressed with previously reported experimental data.</p>

<p>The bacterial sliding clamp (SC), also known as the DNA polymerase III β subunit, is an emerging antibacterial target that plays a central role in DNA replication, serving as a protein-protein interaction hub with a common binding pocket to recognize linear motifs in the partner proteins. Here, fragment-based screening using X-ray crystallography produced four hits bound in the linear-motif-binding pocket of the Escherichia coli SC. Compounds structurally related to the hits were identified that inhibited the E. coli SC and SC-mediated DNA replication in vitro. A tetrahydrocarbazole derivative emerged as a promising lead whose methyl and ethyl ester prodrug forms showed minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 21-43 μg/mL against representative Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria species. The work demonstrates the utility of a fragment-based approach for identifying bacterial sliding clamp inhibitors as lead compounds with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. </p>

<p>Bacterial beta-lactamases hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins. The TEM-type class A beta-lactamase SHV-2 is a natural variant that exhibits activity against third-generation cephalosporins normally resistant to hydrolysis by class A enzymes. SHV-2 contains a single Gly238Ser change relative to the wild-type enzyme SHV-1. Crystallographic refinement of a model including hydrogen atoms gave R and R(free) of 12.4% and 15.0% for data to 0.91 A resolution. The hydrogen atom on the O(gamma) atom of the reactive Ser70 is clearly seen for the first time, bridging to the water molecule activated by Glu166. Though hydrogen atoms on the nearby Lys73 are not seen, this observation of the Ser70 hydrogen atom and the hydrogen bonding pattern around Lys73 indicate that Lys73 is protonated. These findings support a role for the Glu166-water couple, rather than Lys73, as the general base in the deprotonation of Ser70 in the acylation process of class A beta-lactamases. Overlay of SHV-2 with SHV-1 shows a significant 1-3 A displacement in the 238-242 beta-strand-turn segment, making the beta-lactam binding site more open to newer cephalosporins with large C7 substituents and thereby expanding the substrate spectrum of the variant enzyme. The OH group of the buried Ser238 side-chain hydrogen bonds to the main-chain CO of Asn170 on the Omega loop, that is unaltered in position relative to SHV-1. This structural role for Ser238 in protein-protein binding makes less likely its hydrogen bonding to oximino cephalosporins such as cefotaxime or ceftazidime.</p>

<p>Rhomboids are evolutionarily conserved serine proteases that cleave transmembrane proteins within the membrane. The increasing number of known rhomboid functions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes makes them attractive drug targets. Here, we describe structures of the Escherichia coli rhomboid GlpG in complex with β-lactam inhibitors. The inhibitors form a single bond to the catalytic serine and the carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor faces away from the oxyanion hole. The hydrophobic N-substituent of β-lactam inhibitors points into a cavity within the enzyme, providing a structural explanation for the specificity of β-lactams on rhomboid proteases. This same cavity probably represents the S2' substrate binding site of GlpG. We suggest that the structural changes in β-lactam inhibitor binding reflect the state of the enzyme at an initial stage of substrate binding to the active site. The structural insights from these enzyme-inhibitor complexes provide a starting point for structure-based design for rhomboid inhibitors.</p>

<p>Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) catalyze the degradation of the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP, which are important second messengers. Five of the 11 mammalian PDE families have tandem GAF domains at their N termini. PDE10A may be the only mammalian PDE for which cAMP is the GAF domain ligand, and it may be allosterically stimulated by cAMP. PDE10A is highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons. Here we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal GAF domain (GAF-B) of human PDE10A complexed with cAMP at 2.1-angstroms resolution. The conformation of the PDE10A GAF-B domain monomer closely resembles those of the GAF domains of PDE2A and the cyanobacterium Anabaena cyaB2 adenylyl cyclase, except for the helical bundle consisting of alpha1, alpha2, and alpha5. The PDE10A GAF-B domain forms a dimer in the crystal and in solution. The dimerization is mainly mediated by hydrophobic interactions between the helical bundles in a parallel arrangement, with a large buried surface area. In the PDE10A GAF-B domain, cAMP tightly binds to a cNMP-binding pocket. The residues in the alpha3 and alpha4 helices, the beta6 strand, the loop between 3(10) and alpha4, and the loop between alpha4 and beta5 are involved in the recognition of the phosphate and ribose moieties. This recognition mode is similar to those of the GAF domains of PDE2A and cyaB2. In contrast, the adenine base is specifically recognized by the PDE10A GAF-B domain in a unique manner, through residues in the beta1 and beta2 strands.</p>

<p>A carboxylesterase with a beta-lactamase fold from Arthrobacter possesses a low level of hydrolytic activity (0.023 mumol.min(-1).mg(-1)) when acting on a 6-aminohexanoate linear dimer byproduct of the nylon-6 industry (Ald). G181D/H266N/D370Y triple mutations in the parental esterase increased the Ald-hydrolytic activity 160-fold. Kinetic studies showed that the triple mutant possesses higher affinity for the substrate Ald (K(m) = 2.0 mm) than the wild-type Ald hydrolase from Arthrobacter (K(m) = 21 mm). In addition, the k(cat)/K(m) of the mutant (1.58 s(-1).mm(-1)) was superior to that of the wild-type enzyme (0.43 s(-1).mm(-1)), demonstrating that the mutant efficiently converts the unnatural amide compounds even at low substrate concentrations, and potentially possesses an advantage for biotechnological applications. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the G181D/H266N/D370Y enzyme and the inactive S112A-mutant-Ald complex revealed that Ald binding induces rotation of Tyr370/His375, movement of the loop region (N167-V177), and flip-flop of Tyr170, resulting in the transition from open to closed forms. From the comparison of the three-dimensional structures of various mutant enzymes and site-directed mutagenesis at positions 266 and 370, we now conclude that Asn266 makes suitable contacts with Ald and improves the electrostatic environment at the N-terminal region of Ald cooperatively with Asp181, and that Tyr370 stabilizes Ald binding by hydrogen-bonding/hydrophobic interactions at the C-terminal region of Ald.</p>

<p>A well-balanced human diet includes a significant intake of non-starch polysaccharides, collectively termed 'dietary fibre', from the cell walls of diverse fruits and vegetables. Owing to the paucity of alimentary enzymes encoded by the human genome, our ability to derive energy from dietary fibre depends on the saccharification and fermentation of complex carbohydrates by the massive microbial community residing in our distal gut. The xyloglucans (XyGs) are a ubiquitous family of highly branched plant cell wall polysaccharides whose mechanism(s) of degradation in the human gut and consequent importance in nutrition have been unclear. Here we demonstrate that a single, complex gene locus in Bacteroides ovatus confers XyG catabolism in this common colonic symbiont. Through targeted gene disruption, biochemical analysis of all predicted glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate-binding proteins, and three-dimensional structural determination of the vanguard endo-xyloglucanase, we reveal the molecular mechanisms through which XyGs are hydrolysed to component monosaccharides for further metabolism. We also observe that orthologous XyG utilization loci (XyGULs) serve as genetic markers of XyG catabolism in Bacteroidetes, that XyGULs are restricted to a limited number of phylogenetically diverse strains, and that XyGULs are ubiquitous in surveyed human metagenomes. Our findings reveal that the metabolism of even highly abundant components of dietary fibre may be mediated by niche species, which has immediate fundamental and practical implications for gut symbiont population ecology in the context of human diet, nutrition and health. </p>

<p>Emergence of drug-resistant mutants of HIV-1 protease is an ongoing problem in the fight against AIDS. The mechanisms governing resistance are both complex and varied. We have determined crystal structures of HIV-1 protease mutants, D30N, K45I, N88D, and L90M complexed with peptide inhibitor analogues of CA-p2 and p2-NC cleavage sites in the Gag-pol precursor in order to study the structural mechanisms underlying resistance. The structures were determined at 1.55-1.9-A resolution and compared with the wild-type structure. The conformational disorder seen for most of the hydrophobic side-chains around the inhibitor binding site indicates flexibility of binding. Eight water molecules are conserved in all 9 structures; their location suggests that they are important for catalysis as well as structural stability. Structural differences among the mutants were analyzed in relation to the observed changes in protease activity and stability. Mutant L90M shows steric contacts with the catalytic Asp25 that could destabilize the catalytic loop at the dimer interface, leading to its observed decreased dimer stability and activity. Mutant K45I reduces the mobility of the flap and the inhibitor and contributes to an enhancement in structural stability and activity. The side-chain variations at residue 30 relative to wild-type are the largest in D30N and the changes are consistent with the altered activity observed with peptide substrates. Polar interactions in D30N are maintained, in agreement with the observed urea sensitivity. The side-chains of D30N and N88D are linked through a water molecule suggesting correlated changes at the two sites, as seen with clinical inhibitors. Structural changes seen in N88D are small; however, water molecules that mediate interactions between Asn88 and Thr74/Thr31/Asp30 in other complexes are missing in N88D.</p>

<p>We have determined the structure of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in an E2.P(i)-like form stabilized as a complex with MgF(4)(2-), an ATP analog, adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate (AMPPCP), and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). The structure determined at 2.5A resolution leads to a significantly revised model of CPA binding when compared with earlier reports. It shows that a divalent metal ion is required for CPA binding through coordination of the tetramic acid moiety at a characteristic kink of the M1 helix found in all P-type ATPase structures, which is expected to be part of the cytoplasmic cation access pathway. Our model is consistent with the biochemical data on CPA function and provides new measures in structure-based drug design targeting Ca(2+)-ATPases, e.g. from pathogens. We also present an extended structural basis of ATP modulation pinpointing key residues at or near the ATP binding site. A structural comparison to the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase reveals that the Phe(93) side chain occupies the equivalent binding pocket of the CPA site in SERCA, suggesting an important role of this residue in stabilization of the potassium-occluded E2 state of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase.</p>

<p>Glucokinase (GK) catalyses the formation of glucose 6-phosphate from glucose and ATP. A specific feature of GK amongst hexokinases is that it can cycle between active and inactive conformations as a function of glucose concentration, resulting in a unique positive kinetic cooperativity with glucose, which turns GK into a unique key sensor of glucose metabolism, notably in the pancreas. GK is a target of antidiabetic drugs aimed at the activation of GK activity, leading to insulin secretion. Here, the first structures of a GK-glucose complex without activator, of GK-glucose-AMP-PNP and of GK-glucose-AMP-PNP with a bound activator are reported. All these structures are extremely similar, thus demonstrating that binding of GK activators does not result in conformational changes of the active protein but in stabilization of the active form of GK.</p>

<p>Folylpolyglutamate synthetase, which is responsible for the addition of a polyglutamate tail to folate and folate derivatives, is an ATP-dependent enzyme isolated from eukaryotic and bacterial sources, where it plays a key role in the retention of the intracellular folate pool. Here, we report the 2.4-A resolution crystal structure of the MgATP complex of the enzyme from Lactobacillus casei. The structural analysis reveals that folylpolyglutamate synthetase is a modular protein consisting of two domains, one with a typical mononucleotide-binding fold and the other strikingly similar to the folate-binding enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. We have located the active site of the enzyme in a large interdomain cleft adjacent to an ATP-binding P-loop motif. Opposite this site, in the C domain, a cavity likely to be the folate binding site has been identified, and inspection of this cavity and the surrounding protein structure suggests that the glutamate tail of the substrate may project into the active site. A further feature of the structure is a well defined Omega loop, which contributes both to the active site and to interdomain interactions. The determination of the structure of this enzyme represents the first step toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of polyglutamylation of folates and antifolates.</p>

<p>Bacterial luciferase from Vibrio harveyi is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic alpha subunit and a homologous but noncatalytic beta subunit. Despite decades of enzymological investigation, structural evidence defining the active center has been elusive. We report here the crystal structure of V. harveyi luciferase bound to flavin mononucleotide (FMN) at 2.3 A. The isoalloxazine ring is coordinated by an unusual cis-Ala-Ala peptide bond. The reactive sulfhydryl group of Cys106 projects toward position C-4a, the site of flavin oxygenation. This structure also provides the first data specifying the conformations of a mobile loop that is crystallographically disordered in both prior crystal structures [(1995) Biochemistry 34, 6581-6586; (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 21956 21968]. This loop appears to be a boundary between solvent and the active center. Within this portion of the protein, a single contact was observed between Phe272 of the alpha subunit, not seen in the previous structures, and Tyr151 of the beta subunit. Substitutions at position 151 on the beta subunit caused reductions in activity and total quantum yield. Several of these mutants were found to have decreased affinity for reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH(2)). These findings partially address the long-standing question of how the beta subunit stabilizes the active conformation of the alpha subunit, thereby participating in the catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PMT) is essential for phospholipid biogenesis in the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. PfPMT catalyzes the triple methylation of phosphoethanolamine to produce phosphocholine, which is then used for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Here we describe the 2.0Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of PfPMT in complex with amodiaquine. To better characterize inhibition of PfPMT by amodiaquine, we determined the IC(50) values of a series of aminoquinolines using a direct radiochemical assay. Both structural and functional analyses provide a possible approach for the development of new small molecule inhibitors of PfPMT.</p>

<p>Ribosome inhibiting proteins, RIPs, are a widespread family of toxic enzymes. Ricin is a plant toxin used as a poison and biological warfare agent; shiga toxin is a homologue expressed by pathogenic strains of E. coli. There is interest in creating effective antidote inhibitors to this class of enzymes. RIPs act by binding and hydrolyzing a specific adenine base from rRNA. Previous virtual screens revealed that pterins could bind in the specificity pocket of ricin and inhibit the enzyme. In this paper we explore a range of compounds that could serve as better platforms for inhibitor design. This establishes the importance of key hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for active-site complementarity. 8-Methyl-9-oxoguanine is a soluble compound that has the best inhibitory properties of any platform tested. The X-ray structure of this complex revealed that the inhibitor binds in an unexpected way that provides insight for future design. Several inhibitors of ricin were also shown to be inhibitors of shiga toxin, suggesting this program has the potential to develop effective antidotes to an important form of food poisoning.</p>

<p>Oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII) is a tetra-manganese calcium penta-oxygenic cluster (Mn4CaO5) catalyzing light-induced water oxidation through several intermediate states (S-states) by a mechanism that is not fully understood. To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 Å, and compared it with the 1.9 Å structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 Å structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure.</p>

<p>Heparin lyase I (heparinase I) specifically depolymerizes heparin, cleaving the glycosidic linkage next to iduronic acid. Here, we show the crystal structures of heparinase I from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron at various stages of the reaction with heparin oligosaccharides before and just after cleavage and product disaccharide. The heparinase I structure is comprised of a beta-jellyroll domain harboring a long and deep substrate binding groove and an unusual thumb-resembling extension. This thumb, decorated with many basic residues, is of particular importance in activity especially on short heparin oligosaccharides. Unexpected structural similarity of the active site to that of heparinase II with an (alpha/alpha)(6) fold is observed. Mutational studies and kinetic analysis of this enzyme provide insights into the catalytic mechanism, the substrate recognition, and processivity.</p>

<p>The hydrophobic effect--a rationalization of the insolubility of nonpolar molecules in water--is centrally important to biomolecular recognition. Despite extensive research devoted to the hydrophobic effect, its molecular mechanisms remain controversial, and there are still no reliably predictive models for its role in protein-ligand binding. Here we describe a particularly well-defined system of protein and ligands--carbonic anhydrase and a series of structurally homologous heterocyclic aromatic sulfonamides--that we use to characterize hydrophobic interactions thermodynamically and structurally. In binding to this structurally rigid protein, a set of ligands (also defined to be structurally rigid) shows the expected gain in binding free energy as hydrophobic surface area is added. Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrates that enthalpy determines these increases in binding affinity, and that changes in the heat capacity of binding are negative. X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations are compatible with the proposal that the differences in binding between the homologous ligands stem from changes in the number and organization of water molecules localized in the active site in the bound complexes, rather than (or perhaps in addition to) release of structured water from the apposed hydrophobic surfaces. These results support the hypothesis that structured water molecules--including both the molecules of water displaced by the ligands and those reorganized upon ligand binding--determine the thermodynamics of binding of these ligands at the active site of the protein. Hydrophobic effects in various contexts have different structural and thermodynamic origins, although all may be manifestations of the differences in characteristics of bulk water and water close to hydrophobic surfaces.</p>

<p>In order to understand the structure-activity profile observed for a series of substituted dibenz[b,f]azepine antifolates, the crystal structure of the binary complex of human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) with the potent and selective inhibitor 2,4-diamino-6-{2'-O-(3-carboxypropyl)oxydibenz[b,f]-azepin-5-yl}methylpteridine (PT684) was determined to 1.8 Å resolution. These data revealed that the carboxylate side chain of PT684 occupies two alternate positions, neither of which interacts with the conserved Arg70 in the active-site pocket, which in turn hydrogen bonds to water. These observations are in contrast to those reported for the ternary complex of mouse DHFR (mDHFR) with NADPH [Cody et al. (2008), Acta Cryst. D64, 977-984], in which the 3-carboxypropyl side chain of PT684 was hydrolyzed to its hydroxyl derivative, PT684a. The crystallization conditions differed for the human and mouse DHFR crystals (100 mM K2HPO4 pH 6.9, 30% ammonium sulfate for hDHFR; 15 mM Tris pH 8.3, 75 mM sodium cacodylate, PEG 4K for mDHFR). Additionally, the side chains of Phe31 and Gln35 in the hDHFR complex have a single conformation, whereas in the mDHFR complex they occupied two alternative conformations. These data show that the hDHFR complex has a decreased active-site volume compared with the mDHFR complex, as reflected in a relative shift of helix C (residues 59-64) of 1.2 Å, and a shift of 1.5 Å compared with the ternary complex of Pneumocystis carinii DHFR (pcDHFR) with the parent dibenz[b,f]azepine PT653. These data suggest that the greater inhibitory potency of PT684 against pcDHFR is consistent with the larger active-site volume of pcDHFR and the predicted interactions of the carboxylate side chain with Arg75.</p>

<p>Phytochrome is a multidomain dimeric red light photoreceptor that utilizes a chromophore-binding domain (CBD), a PHY domain, and an output module to induce cellular changes in response to light. A promising biotechnology tool emerged when a structure-based substitution at Asp-207 was shown to be an infrared fluorophore that uses a biologically available tetrapyrrole chromophore. We report multiple crystal structures of this D207H variant of the Deinococcus radiodurans CBD, in which His-207 is observed to form a hydrogen bond with either the tetrapyrrole A-ring oxygen or the Tyr-263 hydroxyl. Based on the implications of this duality for fluorescence properties, Y263F was introduced and shown to have stronger fluorescence than the original D207H template. Our structures are consistent with the model that the Y263F change prevents a red light-induced far-red light absorbing phytochrome chromophore configuration. With the goal of decreasing size and thereby facilitating use as a fluorescent tag in vivo, we also engineered a monomeric form of the CBD. Unexpectedly, photoconversion was observed in the monomer despite the lack of a PHY domain. This observation underscores an interplay between dimerization and the photochemical properties of phytochrome and suggests that the monomeric CBD could be used for further studies of the photocycle. The D207H substitution on its own in the monomer did not result in fluorescence, whereas Y263F did. Combined, the D207H and Y263F substitutions in the monomeric CBD lead to the brightest of our variants, designated Wisconsin infrared phytofluor (Wi-Phy).</p>

<p>A disulfide-linked nitroxide side chain (R1) used in site-directed spin labeling of proteins often exhibits an EPR spectrum characteristic of a weakly ordered z-axis anisotropic motion at topographically diverse surface sites, including those on helices, loops and edge strands of beta-sheets. To elucidate the origin of this motion, the first crystal structures of R1 that display simple z-axis anisotropic motion at solvent-exposed helical sites (131 and 151) and a loop site (82) in T4 lysozyme have been determined. Structures of 131R1 and 151R1 determined at cryogenic or ambient temperature reveal an intraresidue C(alpha)--H...S(delta) interaction that immobilizes the disulfide group, consistent with a model in which the internal motions of R1 are dominated by rotations about the two terminal bonds (Columbus, Kálai, Jeko, Hideg, and Hubbell, Biochemistry 2001;40:3828-3846). Remarkably, the 131R1 side chain populates two rotamers equally, but the EPR spectrum reflects a single dominant dynamic population, showing that the two rotamers have similar internal motion determined by the common disulfide-backbone interaction. The anisotropic motion for loop residue 82R1 is also accounted for by a common disulfide-backbone interaction, showing that the interaction does not require a specific secondary structure. If the above observations prove to be general, then significant variations in order and rate for R1 at noninteracting solvent-exposed helical and loop sites can be assigned to backbone motion because the internal motion is essentially constant.</p>

<p>Fragment screens have successfully identified new scaffolds in drug discovery, often with relatively high hit rates (5%) using small screening libraries (1,000-10,000 compounds). This raises two questions: would other noteworthy chemotypes be found were one to screen all commercially available fragments (&gt;300,000), and does the success rate imply low specificity of fragments? We used molecular docking to screen large libraries of fragments against CTX-M beta-lactamase. We identified ten millimolar-range inhibitors from the 69 compounds tested. The docking poses corresponded closely to the crystallographic structures subsequently determined. Notably, these initial low-affinity hits showed little specificity between CTX-M and an unrelated beta-lactamase, AmpC, which is unusual among beta-lactamase inhibitors. This is consistent with the idea that the high hit rates among fragments correlate to a low initial specificity. As the inhibitors were progressed, both specificity and affinity rose together, yielding to our knowledge the first micromolar-range noncovalent inhibitors against a class A beta-lactamase.</p>

<p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs), which are essential in eukaryotes, have no confirmed function in prokaryotes that are devoid of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The structure of a secretable LOX from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa_LOX), the first available from a prokaryote, presents significant differences with respect to eukaryotic LOXs, including a cluster of helices acting as a lid to the active center. The mobility of the lid and the structural variability of the N-terminal region of Pa_LOX was confirmed by comparing 2 crystal forms. The binding pocket contains a phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipid with branches of 18 (sn-1) and 14/16 (sn-2) carbon atoms in length. Carbon atoms from the sn-1 chain approach the catalytic iron in a manner that sheds light on how the enzymatic reaction might proceed. The findings in these studies suggest that Pa_LOX has the capacity to extract and modify unsaturated phospholipids from eukaryotic membranes, allowing this LOX to play a role in the interaction of P. aeruginosa with host cells.</p>

Structures of 131R1 and 151R1 determined at cryogenic or ambient temperature reveal an intraresidue C(alpha)--H...S(delta) interaction that immobilizes the disulfide group, consistent with a model in which the internal motions of R1 are dominated by rotations about the two terminal bonds (Columbus, Kálai, Jeko, Hideg, and Hubbell, Biochemistry 2001;40:3828-3846). Remarkably, the 131R1 side chain populates two rotamers equally, but the EPR spectrum reflects a single dominant dynamic population, showing that the two rotamers have similar internal motion determined by the common disulfide-backbone interaction. The anisotropic motion for loop residue 82R1 is also accounted for by a common disulfide-backbone interaction, showing that the interaction does not require a specific secondary structure. If the above observations prove to be general, then significant variations in order and rate for R1 at noninteracting solvent-exposed helical and loop sites can be assigned to backbone motion because the internal motion is essentially constant.</p>

<p>A series of 6-substituted and 5-fluoro-6-substituted uridine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their potential as anticancer agents. The designed molecules were synthesized from either fully protected uridine or the corresponding 5-fluorouridine derivatives. The mononucleotide derivatives were used for enzyme inhibition investigations against ODCase. Anticancer activities of all the synthesized derivatives were evaluated using the nucleoside forms of the inhibitors. 5-Fluoro-UMP was a very weak inhibitor of ODCase. 6-Azido-5-fluoro and 5-fluoro-6-iodo derivatives are covalent inhibitors of ODCase, and the active site Lys145 residue covalently binds to the ligand after the elimination of the 6-substitution. Among the synthesized nucleoside derivatives, 6-azido-5-fluoro, 6-amino-5-fluoro, and 6-carbaldehyde-5-fluoro derivatives showed potent anticancer activities in cell-based assays against various leukemia cell lines. On the basis of the overall profile, 6-azido-5-fluoro and 6-amino-5-fluoro uridine derivatives exhibited potential for further investigations.</p>

<p>Transcriptional activity and chromatin structure accessibility are correlated with the methylation of specific histone residues. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is the first discovered histone demethylase, which demethylates Lys4 or Lys9 of histone H3, using FAD. Among the known monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tranylcypromine (Parnate) showed the most potent inhibitory effect on LSD1. Recently, the crystal structure of LSD1 and tranylcypromine was solved at 2.75 A, revealing a five-membered ring fused to the flavin of LSD1. In this study, we refined the crystal structure of the LSD1-tranylcypromine complex to 2.25 A. The five-membered ring model did not fit completely with the electron density, giving R(work)/R(free) values of 0.226/0.254. On the other hand, the N(5) adduct gave the lowest R(work)/R(free) values of 0.218/0.248, among the tested models. These results imply that the LSD1-tranylcypromine complex is not completely composed of the five-membered adduct, but partially contains an intermediate, such as the N(5) adduct.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of A-form and B-form DNA duplexes containing 2'-S-methyl-uridines reveal that the modified residues adopt a RNA-like C3'-endo pucker, illustrating that the replacement of electronegative oxygen at the 2'-carbon of RNA by sulfur does not appear to fundamentally alter the conformational preference of the sugar in the oligonucleotide context and sterics trump stereoelectronics.</p>

<p>Human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a significant target for therapeutic drugs. Here we present high resolution crystal structures of human AChE, alone and in complexes with drug ligands; donepezil, an Alzheimer's disease drug, binds differently to human AChE than it does to  Torpedo  AChE. These crystals of human AChE provide a more accurate platform for further drug development than previously available.</p>

<p>Phosphotriesterase (PTE) from Pseudomonas diminuta catalyzes the detoxification of organophosphates such as the widely utilized insecticide paraoxon and the chemical warfare agent sarin. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is known from high resolution x-ray crystallographic analyses. Each subunit of the homodimer folds into a so-called TIM barrel, with eight strands of parallel beta-sheet. The two zinc ions required for activity are positioned at the C-terminal portion of the beta-barrel. Here, we describe the three-dimensional structure of PTE complexed with the inhibitor diisopropyl methyl phosphonate, which serves as a mimic for sarin. Additionally, the structure of the enzyme complexed with triethyl phosphate is also presented. In the case of the PTE-diisopropyl methyl phosphonate complex, the phosphoryl oxygen of the inhibitor coordinates to the more solvent-exposed zinc ion (2.5 A), thereby lending support to the presumed catalytic mechanism involving metal coordination of the substrate. In the PTE-triethyl phosphate complex, the phosphoryl oxygen of the inhibitor is positioned at 3.4 A from the more solvent-exposed zinc ion. The two structures described in this report provide additional molecular understanding for the ability of this remarkable enzyme to hydrolyze such a wide range of organophosphorus substrates.</p>

<p>The x-ray crystallographic structure of selenomethionyl cytosine-5'-monophosphate-acylneuraminate synthetase (CMP-NeuAc synthetase) from Neisseria meningitidis has been determined at 2.0-A resolution using multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing, and a second structure, in the presence of the substrate analogue CDP, has been determined at 2.2-A resolution by molecular replacement. This work identifies the active site residues for this class of enzyme for the first time. The detailed interactions between the enzyme and CDP within the mononucleotide-binding pocket are directly observed, and the acylneuraminate-binding pocket has also been identified. A model of acylneuraminate bound to CMP-NeuAc synthetase has been constructed and provides a structural basis for understanding the mechanism of production of "activated" sialic acids. Sialic acids are key saccharide components on the surface of mammalian cells and can be virulence factors in a variety of bacterial species (e.g. Neisseria, Haemophilus, group B streptococci, etc.). As such, the identification of the bacterial CMP-NeuAc synthetase active site can serve as a starting point for rational drug design strategies.</p>

<p>Two X-ray data sets for a complex of human aldose reductase (h-AR) with the inhibitor IDD 594 and the cofactor NADP(+) were collected from two different parts of the same crystal to a resolution of 0.81 A at 15 and 60 K using cold helium gas as cryogen. The contribution of temperature to the atomic B values was estimated by comparison of the independently refined models. It was found that although being slightly different for different kinds of atoms, the differences (deltaB) in the isotropic equivalents B of atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) were approximately constant (about 1.7 A(2)) for well ordered atoms as the temperature was increased from 15 to 60 K. The mean value of this difference varied according to the number of non-H atoms covalently bound to the parent atom. Atoms having a B value of higher than 8 A(2) at 15 K showed much larger deviations of deltaB from the average value, which might reflect partial occupancy of atomic sites. An analysis of the anisotropy of ADPs for individual atoms revealed an increase in the isotropy of ADPs with the increase of the temperature from 15 to 60 K. In a separate experiment, a 0.93 A resolution data set was collected from a different crystal of the same complex at 100 K using cold nitrogen as a cryogen. The effects of various errors on the atomic B values were estimated by comparison of the refined models and the temperature-dependent component was inferred. It was found that both decreasing the data redundancy and increasing the resolution cutoff led to an approximately constant increase in atomic B values for well ordered atoms.</p>

<p>Subclass B1 beta-lactamases are Zn(II)-dependent hydrolases that confer bacterial resistance to most clinically useful beta-lactam antibiotics. The enzyme BcII from Bacillus cereus is a prototypical enzyme that belongs to this group, the first Zn(II)-dependent beta-lactamase to be discovered. Crucial aspects of the BcII catalytic mechanism and metal binding mode have been assessed mostly on the Co(II)-substituted surrogate. Here we report a high-resolution structure of Co(II)-BcII, revealing a metal coordination geometry identical to that of the native zinc enzyme. In addition, a high-resolution structure of the apoenzyme, together with structures with different degrees of metal occupancy and oxidation levels of a conserved Cys ligand, discloses a considerable mobility of two loops containing four metal ligands (namely, regions His116-Arg121 and Gly219-Cys221). This flexibility is expected to assist in the structural rearrangement of the metal sites during catalytic turnover, which, along with the coordination geometry adaptability of Zn(II) ions, grants the interaction with a variety of substrates, a characteristic feature of B1 metallo-beta-lactamases.</p>

<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalyzes the reversible decarboxylation of oxaloacetic acid with the concomitant transfer of the gamma-phosphate of GTP to form PEP and GDP as the first committed step of gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis. The three structures of the mitochondrial isoform of PEPCK reported are complexed with Mn2+, Mn2+-PEP, or Mn2+-malonate-Mn2+ GDP and provide the first observations of the structure of the mitochondrial isoform and insight into the mechanism of catalysis mediated by this enzyme. The structures show the involvement of the hyper-reactive cysteine (C307) in the coordination of the active site Mn2+. Upon formation of the PEPCK-Mn2+-PEP or PEPCK-Mn2+-malonate-Mn2+ GDP complexes, C307 coordination is lost as the P-loop in which it resides adopts a different conformation. The structures suggest that stabilization of the cysteine-coordinated metal geometry holds the enzyme as a catalytically incompetent metal complex and may represent a previously unappreciated mechanism of regulation. A third conformation of the mobile P-loop in the PEPCK-Mn2+-malonate-Mn2+ GDP complex demonstrates the participation of a previously unrecognized, conserved serine residue (S305) in mediating phosphoryl transfer. The ordering of the mobile active site lid in the PEPCK-Mn2+-malonate-Mn2+ GDP complex yields the first observation of this structural feature and provides additional insight into the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer.</p>

<p>Despite the importance of tryptophan (Trp) radicals in biology, very few radicals have been trapped and characterized in a physiologically meaningful context. Here we demonstrate that the diheme enzyme MauG uses Trp radical chemistry to catalyze formation of a Trp-derived tryptophan tryptophylquinone cofactor on its substrate protein, premethylamine dehydrogenase. The unusual six-electron oxidation that results in tryptophan tryptophylquinone formation occurs in three discrete two-electron catalytic steps. Here the exact order of these oxidation steps in the processive six-electron biosynthetic reaction is determined, and reaction intermediates are structurally characterized. The intermediates observed in crystal structures are also verified in solution using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, an unprecedented Trp-derived diradical species on premethylamine dehydrogenase, which is an intermediate in the first two-electron step, is characterized using high-frequency and -field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy. This work defines a unique mechanism for radical-mediated catalysis of a protein substrate, and has broad implications in the areas of applied biocatalysis and understanding of oxidative protein modification during oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Polyadenylate [poly(A)] polymerase (PAP) catalyzes the addition of a polyadenosine tail to almost all eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The crystal structure of the PAP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pap1) has been solved to 2.6 angstroms, both alone and in complex with 3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3'-dATP). Like other nucleic acid polymerases, Pap1 is composed of three domains that encircle the active site. The arrangement of these domains, however, is quite different from that seen in polymerases that use a template to select and position their incoming nucleotides. The first two domains are functionally analogous to polymerase palm and fingers domains. The third domain is attached to the fingers domain and is known to interact with the single-stranded RNA primer. In the nucleotide complex, two molecules of 3'-dATP are bound to Pap1. One occupies the position of the incoming base, prior to its addition to the mRNA chain. The other is believed to occupy the position of the 3' end of the mRNA primer.</p>

<p>1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone ethylene. Recently, a new biological role for ACS has been found in Cucumis melo where a single point mutation (A57V) of one isoform of the enzyme, causing reduced activity, results in andromonoecious plants. We present here a straightforward structural basis for the reduced activity of the A57V mutant, based on our work on Malus domestica ACS, including a new structure of the unliganded apple enzyme at 1.35Å resolution.</p>

<p>Beta-lactamases are the most widespread resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins. Transition-state analogues that bind to the enzymes with nanomolar affinities have been introduced in an effort to reverse the resistance conferred by these enzymes. To understand the origins of this affinity, and to guide design of future inhibitors, double-mutant thermodynamic cycle experiments were undertaken. An unexpected hydrogen bond between the nonconserved Asn289 and a key inhibitor carboxylate was observed in the X-ray crystal structure of a 1 nM inhibitor (compound 1) in complex with AmpC beta-lactamase. To investigate the energy of this hydrogen bond, the mutant enzyme N289A was made, as was an analogue of 1 that lacked the carboxylate (compound 2). The differential affinity of the four different protein and analogue complexes indicates that the carboxylate-amide hydrogen bond contributes 1.7 kcal/mol to overall binding affinity. Synthesis of an analogue of 1 where the carboxylate was replaced with an aldehyde led to an inhibitor that lost all this hydrogen bond energy, consistent with the importance of the ionic nature of this hydrogen bond. To investigate the structural bases of these energies, X-ray crystal structures of N289A/1 and N289A/2 were determined to 1.49 and 1.39 A, respectively. These structures suggest that no significant rearrangement occurs in the mutant versus the wild-type complexes with both compounds. The mutant enzymes L119A and L293A were made to investigate the interaction between a phenyl ring in 1 and these residues. Whereas deletion of the phenyl itself diminishes affinity by 5-fold, the double-mutant cycles suggest that this energy does not come through interaction with the leucines, despite the close contact in the structure. The energies of these interactions provide key information for the design of improved inhibitors against beta-lactamases. The high magnitude of the ion-dipole interaction between Asn289 and the carboxylate of 1 is consistent with the idea that ionic interactions can provide significant net affinity in inhibitor complexes.</p>

<p>Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGDO) uses a mononuclear nonheme Fe(2+) to catalyze the oxidative ring cleavage in the degradation of Tyr and Phe by producing maleylacetoacetate from homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate). Here, we report three crystal structures of HGDO, revealing five different steps in its reaction cycle at 1.7-1.98 Å resolution. The resting state structure displays an octahedral coordination for Fe(2+) with two histidine residues (His331 and His367), a bidentate carboxylate ligand (Glu337), and two water molecules. Homogentisate binds as a monodentate ligand to Fe(2+), and its interaction with Tyr346 invokes the folding of a loop over the active site, effectively shielding it from solvent. Binding of homogentisate is driven by enthalpy and is entropically disfavored as shown by anoxic isothermal titration calorimetry. Three different reaction cycle intermediates have been trapped in different HGDO subunits of a single crystal showing the influence of crystal packing interactions on the course of enzymatic reactions. The observed superoxo:semiquinone-, alkylperoxo-, and product-bound intermediates have been resolved in a crystal grown anoxically with homogentisate, which was subsequently incubated with dioxygen. We demonstrate that, despite different folds, active site architectures, and Fe(2+) coordination, extradiol dioxygenases can proceed through the same principal reaction intermediates to catalyze the O2-dependent cleavage of aromatic rings. Thus, convergent evolution of nonhomologous enzymes using the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad motif developed different solutions to stabilize closely related intermediates in unlike environments. </p>

<p>Carbapenem antibiotics are often the "last resort" in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. To understand why meropenem is resistant to hydrolysis by the SHV-1 class A beta-lactamase, the atomic structure of meropenem inactivated SHV-1 was solved to 1.05 A resolution. Two conformations of the Ser70 acylated intermediate are observed in the SHV-1-meropenem complex; the meropenem carbonyl oxygen atom of the acyl-enzyme is in the oxyanion hole in one conformation, while in the other conformation it is not. Although the structures of the SHV-1 apoenzyme and the SHV-1-meropenem complex are very similar (0.29 A rmsd for Calpha atoms), the orientation of the conserved Ser130 is different. Notably, the Ser130-OH group of the SHV-1-meropenem complex is directed toward Lys234Nz, while the Ser130-OH of the apo enzyme is oriented toward the Lys73 amino group. This altered position may affect proton transfer via Ser130 and the rate of hydrolysis. A most intriguing finding is the crystallographic detection of protonation of the Glu166 known to be involved in the deacylation mechanism. The critical deacylation water molecule has an additional hydrogen-bonding interaction with the OH group of meropenem's 6alpha-1 R-hydroxyethyl substituent. This interaction may weaken the nucleophilicity and/or change the direction of the lone pair of electrons of the water molecule and result in poor turnover of meropenem by the SHV-1 beta-lactamase. Using timed mass spectrometry, we further show that meropenem is covalently attached to SHV-1 beta-lactamase for at least 60 min. These observations explain key properties of meropenem's ability to resist hydrolysis by SHV-1 and lead to important insights regarding future carbapenem and beta-lactamase inhibitor design.</p>

<p>ABCB10 is one of the three ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters found in the inner membrane of mitochondria. In mammals ABCB10 is essential for erythropoiesis, and for protection of mitochondria against oxidative stress. ABCB10 is therefore a potential therapeutic target for diseases in which increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress play a major role. The crystal structure of apo-ABCB10 shows a classic exporter fold ABC transporter structure, in an open-inwards conformation, ready to bind the substrate or nucleotide from the inner mitochondrial matrix or membrane. Unexpectedly, however, ABCB10 adopts an open-inwards conformation when complexed with nonhydrolysable ATP analogs, in contrast to other transporter structures which adopt an open-outwards conformation in complex with ATP. The three complexes of ABCB10/ATP analogs reported here showed varying degrees of opening of the transport substrate binding site, indicating that in this conformation there is some flexibility between the two halves of the protein. These structures suggest that the observed plasticity, together with a portal between two helices in the transmembrane region of ABCB10, assist transport substrate entry into the substrate binding cavity. These structures indicate that ABC transporters may exist in an open-inwards conformation when nucleotide is bound. We discuss ways in which this observation can be aligned with the current views on mechanisms of ABC transporters.</p>

<p>The Escherichia coli T4 bacteriophage uses two glycosyltransferases to glucosylate and thus protect its DNA: the retaining alpha-glucosyltransferase (AGT) and the inverting beta-glucosyltransferase (BGT). They glucosylate 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-HMC) bases of duplex DNA using UDP-glucose as the sugar donor to form an alpha-glucosidic linkage and a beta-glucosidic linkage, respectively. Five structures of AGT have been determined: a binary complex with the UDP product and four ternary complexes with UDP or UDP-glucose and oligonucleotides containing an A:G, HMU:G (hydroxymethyl uracyl) or AP:G (apurinic/apyrimidinic) mismatch at the target base-pair. AGT adopts the GT-B fold, one of the two folds known for GTs. However, while the sugar donor binding mode is classical for a GT-B enzyme, the sugar acceptor binding mode is unexpected and breaks the established consensus: AGT is the first GT-B enzyme that predominantly binds both the sugar donor and acceptor to the C-terminal domain. Its active site pocket is highly similar to four retaining GT-B glycosyltransferases (trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, glycogen synthase, glycogen and maltodextrin phosphorylases) strongly suggesting a common evolutionary origin and catalytic mechanism for these enzymes. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analysis do not permit identification of a nucleophile residue responsible for a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate for the classical double displacement mechanism. Interestingly, the DNA structures reveal partially flipped-out bases. They provide evidence for a passive role of AGT in the base-flipping mechanism and for its specific recognition of the acceptor base.</p>

<p>The DNA nucleotide thymidylate is synthesized by the enzyme thymidylate synthase, which catalyzes the reductive methylation of deoxyuridylate using the cofactor methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH(2)H(4)folate). Most organisms, including humans, rely on the thyA- or TYMS-encoded classic thymidylate synthase, whereas, certain microorganisms, including all Rickettsia and other pathogens, use an alternative thyX-encoded flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS). Although several crystal structures of FDTSs have been reported, the absence of a structure with folates limits understanding of the molecular mechanism and the scope of drug design for these enzymes. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of FDTS with several folate derivatives, which together with mutagenesis, kinetic analysis, and computer modeling shed light on the cofactor binding and function. The unique structural data will likely facilitate further elucidation of FDTSs' mechanism and the design of structure-based inhibitors as potential leads to new antimicrobial drugs.</p>

<p>Fragment screens for new ligands have had wide success, notwithstanding their constraint to libraries of 1,000-10,000 molecules. Larger libraries would be addressable were molecular docking reliable for fragment screens, but this has not been widely accepted. To investigate docking's ability to prioritize fragments, a library of &gt;137,000 such molecules were docked against the structure of beta-lactamase. Forty-eight fragments highly ranked by docking were acquired and tested; 23 had K(i) values ranging from 0.7 to 9.2 mM. X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme-bound complexes were determined for 8 of the fragments. For 4, the correspondence between the predicted and experimental structures was high (RMSD between 1.2 and 1.4 A), whereas for another 2, the fidelity was lower but retained most key interactions (RMSD 2.4-2.6 A). Two of the 8 fragments adopted very different poses in the active site owing to enzyme conformational changes. The 48% hit rate of the fragment docking compares very favorably with "lead-like" docking and high-throughput screening against the same enzyme. To understand this, we investigated the occurrence of the fragment scaffolds among larger, lead-like molecules. Approximately 1% of commercially available fragments contain these inhibitors whereas only 10(-7)% of lead-like molecules do. This suggests that many more chemotypes and combinations of chemotypes are present among fragments than are available among lead-like molecules, contributing to the higher hit rates. The ability of docking to prioritize these fragments suggests that the technique can be used to exploit the better chemotype coverage that exists at the fragment level.</p>

<p>Glutathione S-transferase (GST), an essential detoxification enzyme in parasitic helminths, is a major vaccine target and an attractive drug target against schistosomiasis and other helminthic diseases. Crystal structures of the 26 kDa GST from the helminth Schistosoma japonica (SjGST) have been determined for the unligated enzyme (resolution = 2.4 A, R-factor = 19.7%) and for the enzyme bound to the leading antischistosomal drug praziquantel (resolution = 2.6 A, R-factor = 21.2%). The protein, recombinantly expressed using the Pharamacia PGEX-3X vector for production of GST fusion proteins, contains all 218 residues of SjGST and an additional 13 residues at the C terminus. The structure of unligated SjGST shows that the glutathione binding site pre-exists unchanged in the ligand-free enzyme and is conserved between parasitic and the mammalian class mu enzymes. At therapeutic concentrations the leading antischistosomal drug praziquantel (PZQ) binds one drug per enzyme homodimer in the dimer interface groove adjoining the two catalytic sites. This establishes a protein target for PZQ, identifies the GST non-substrate ligand transport site, and implicates PZQ in steric inhibition of SjGST catalytic and transport for large ligands. Thus, increased expression or mutagenesis of SjGST by the parasite may confer resistance to PZQ. Differences in the xenobiotic binding region between parasitic and mammalian GSTs reveal a distinct substrate repertoire for SjGST and, together with the newly identified PZQ binding site, provide the basis for design of novel antischistosomal drugs. Due to the widespread use expression systems based on SjGST fusions, the atomic structure of SjGST should also provide an important tool for phasing fusion protein structures by molecular replacement.</p>

<p>The SARS coronavirus main peptidase (SARS-CoV M(pro)) plays an essential role in the life-cycle of the virus and is a primary target for the development of anti-SARS agents. Here, we report the crystal structure of M(pro) at a resolution of 1.82 Angstroms, in space group P2(1) at pH 6.0. In contrast to the previously reported structure of M(pro) in the same space group at the same pH, the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers in the structure of M(pro) reported here are in the catalytically competent conformation, suggesting their conformational flexibility. We report two crystal structures of M(pro) having an additional Ala at the N terminus of each protomer (M(+A(-1))(pro)), both at a resolution of 2.00 Angstroms, in space group P4(3)2(1)2: one unbound and one bound by a substrate-like aza-peptide epoxide (APE). In the unbound form, the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers of M(+A(-1))(pro) are observed in a collapsed (catalytically incompetent) conformation; whereas they are in an open (catalytically competent) conformation in the APE-bound form. The observed conformational flexibility of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets suggests that these parts of M(pro) exist in dynamic equilibrium. The structural data further suggest that the binding of APE to M(pro) follows an induced-fit model. The substrate likely also binds in an induced-fit manner in a process that may help drive the catalytic cycle.</p>

<p>The diuretic drug ethacrynic acid, an inhibitor of pi class glutathione S-transferase, has been tested in clinical trials as an adjuvant in chemotherapy. We recently solved the crystal structure of this enzyme in complex with ethacrynic acid and its glutathione conjugate. Here we present a new structure of the ethacrynic-glutathione conjugate complex. In this structure the ethacrynic moiety of the complex is shown to bind in a completely different orientation to that previously observed. Thus there are at least two binding modes possible, an observation of great importance to the design of second generation inhibitors of the enzyme.</p>

<p>Alpha-glucuronidases cleave the alpha-1,2-glycosidic bond between 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid and short xylooligomers as part of the hemicellulose degradation system. To date, all of the alpha-glucuronidases are classified as family 67 glycosidases, which catalyze the hydrolysis via the investing mechanism. Here we describe several high resolution crystal structures of the alpha-glucuronidase (AguA) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, in complex with its substrate and products. In the complex of AguA with the intact substrate, the 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid sugar ring is distorted into a half-chair conformation, which is closer to the planar conformation required for the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state structure. In the active site, a water molecule is coordinated between two carboxylic acids, in an appropriate position to act as a nucleophile. From the structural data it is likely that two carboxylic acids, Asp(364) and Glu(392), activate together the nucleophilic water molecule. The loop carrying the catalytic general acid Glu(285) cannot be resolved in some of the structures but could be visualized in its "open" and "closed" (catalytic) conformations in other structures. The protonated state of Glu(285) is presumably stabilized by its proximity to the negative charge of the substrate, representing a new variation of substrate-assisted catalysis mechanism.</p>

<p>The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis highlights the need for identifying new antitubercular drugs that can treat these infections. The antigen 85 (Ag85) complex has emerged as an intriguing mycobacterial drug target due to its central role in synthesizing major components of the inner and outer leaflets of the mycobacterial outer membrane. Here we identify ebselen (EBS) as a potent inhibitor of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ag85 complex. Mass spectrometry data show that EBS binds covalently to a cysteine residue (C209) located near the Ag85C active site. The crystal structure of Ag85C in the presence of EBS shows that C209 modification restructures the active site, thereby disrupting the hydrogen-bonded network within the active site that is essential for enzymatic activity. C209 mutations display marked decreases in enzymatic activity. These data suggest that compounds using this mechanism of action will strongly inhibit the Ag85 complex and minimize the selection of drug resistance. </p>

<p>Oxidative damage to DNA generates 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG). During DNA replication and repair synthesis, 8-oxodG can pair with cytosine or adenine. The ability to accurately replicate through this lesion depends on the DNA polymerase. We report the first structure of a polymerase with a promutagenic DNA lesion, 8-oxodG, in the confines of its active site. The modified guanine residue is in an anti conformation and forms Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with an incoming dCTP. To accommodate the oxygen at C8, the 5'-phosphate backbone of the templating nucleotide flips 180 degrees. Thus, the flexibility of the template sugar-phosphate backbone near the polymerase active site is one parameter that influences the anti-syn equilibrium of 8-oxodG. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms employed by polymerases to select the complementary dNTP.</p>

<p>DYRK1B is a kinase over-expressed in certain cancer cells (including colon, ovarian, pancreatic, etc.). Recent publications have demonstrated inhibition of DYRK1B could be an attractive target for cancer therapy. From a data-mining effort, the team has discovered analogues of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines as potent enantio-selective inhibitors of DYRK1B. Cells treated with a tool compound from this series showed the same cellular effects as down regulation of DYRK1B with siRNA. Such effects are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action. Progress of the SAR study is presented. </p>

<p>Class I alpha1,2-mannosidases (glycosylhydrolase family 47) are key enzymes in the maturation of N-glycans. This protein family includes two distinct enzymatically active subgroups. Subgroup 1 includes the yeast and human endoplasmic reticulum (ER) alpha1,2-mannosidases that primarily trim Man(9)GlcNAc(2) to Man(8)GlcNAc(2) isomer B whereas subgroup 2 includes mammalian Golgi alpha1,2-mannosidases IA, IB, and IC that trim Man(9)GlcNAc(2) to Man(5)GlcNAc(2) via Man(8)GlcNAc(2) isomers A and C. The structure of the catalytic domain of the subgroup 2 alpha1,2-mannosidase from Penicillium citrinum has been determined by molecular replacement at 2.2-A resolution. The fungal alpha1,2-mannosidase is an (alphaalpha)(7)-helix barrel, very similar to the subgroup 1 yeast (Vallée, F., Lipari, F., Yip, P., Sleno, B., Herscovics, A., and Howell, P. L. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 581-588) and human (Vallée, F., Karaveg, K., Herscovics, A., Moremen, K. W., and Howell, P. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 41287-41298) ER enzymes. The location of the conserved acidic residues of the catalytic site and the binding of the inhibitors, kifunensine and 1-deoxymannojirimycin, to the essential calcium ion are conserved in the fungal enzyme. However, there are major structural differences in the oligosaccharide binding site between the two alpha1,2-mannosidase subgroups. In the subgroup 1 enzymes, an arginine residue plays a critical role in stabilizing the oligosaccharide substrate. In the fungal alpha1,2-mannosidase this arginine is replaced by glycine. This replacement and other sequence variations result in a more spacious carbohydrate binding site. Modeling studies of interactions between the yeast, human and fungal enzymes with different Man(8)GlcNAc(2) isomers indicate that there is a greater degree of freedom to bind the oligosaccharide in the active site of the fungal enzyme than in the yeast and human ER alpha1,2-mannosidases.</p>

<p>We report the crystal structure of a thermophilic "ene" reductase (TOYE) isolated from Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus E39. The crystal structure reveals a tetrameric enzyme and an active site that is relatively large compared to most other structurally determined and related Old Yellow Enzymes. The enzyme adopts higher order oligomeric states (octamers and dodecamers) in solution, as revealed by sedimentation velocity and multiangle laser light scattering. Bead modelling indicates that the solution structure is consistent with the basic tetrameric structure observed in crystallographic studies and electron microscopy. TOYE is stable at high temperatures (T(m)&gt;70 degrees C) and shows increased resistance to denaturation in water-miscible organic solvents compared to the mesophilic Old Yellow Enzyme family member, pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase. TOYE has typical ene-reductase properties of the Old Yellow Enzyme family. There is currently major interest in using Old Yellow Enzyme family members in the preparative biocatalysis of a number of activated alkenes. The increased stability of TOYE in organic solvents is advantageous for biotransformations in which water-miscible organic solvents and biphasic reaction conditions are required to both deliver novel substrates and minimize product racemisation.</p>

<p>The cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that generate prostaglandin H(2) from arachidonic acid (AA). Although AA is the preferred substrate, other fatty acids are oxygenated by these enzymes with varying efficiencies. We determined the crystal structures of AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) bound to Co(3+)-protoporphyrin IX-reconstituted murine COX-2 to 2.1, 2.4, and 2.65 A, respectively. AA, EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid bind in different conformations in each monomer constituting the homodimer in their respective structures such that one monomer exhibits nonproductive binding and the other productive binding of the substrate in the cyclooxygenase channel. The interactions identified between protein and substrate when bound to COX-1 are conserved in our COX-2 structures, with the only notable difference being the lack of interaction of the carboxylate of AA and EPA with the side chain of Arg-120. Leu-531 exhibits a different side chain conformation when the nonproductive and productive binding modes of AA are compared. Unlike COX-1, mutating this residue to Ala, Phe, Pro, or Thr did not result in a significant loss of activity or substrate binding affinity. Determination of the L531F:AA crystal structure resulted in AA binding in the same global conformation in each monomer. We speculate that the mobility of the Leu-531 side chain increases the volume available at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel and contributes to the observed ability of COX-2 to oxygenate a broad spectrum of fatty acid and fatty ester substrates.</p>

<p>The galactoside acetyltransferase (thiogalactoside transacetylase) of Escherichia coli (GAT, LacA, EC 2.3.1.18) is a gene product of the classical lac operon. GAT may assist cellular detoxification by acetylating nonmetabolizable pyranosides, thereby preventing their reentry into the cell. The structure of GAT has been solved in binary complexes with acetyl-CoA or CoA and in ternary complexes with CoA and the nonphysiological acceptor substrates isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) or p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (PNPbetaGal). A hydrophobic cleft that binds the thioisopropyl and p-nitrophenyl aglycones of IPTG and PNPbetaGal may discriminate against substrates with hydrophilic substituents at this position, such as lactose, or inducers of the lac operon. An extended loop projecting from the left-handed parallel beta helix domain contributes His115, which is in position to facilitate attack of the C6-hydroxyl group of the substrate on the thioester.</p>

<p>Structural data are reported for five antifolates, namely 2,4-diamino-6-[5'-(5-carboxypentyloxy)-2'-methoxybenzyl]-5-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine, (1), and the 5'-[3-(ethoxycarbonyl)propoxy]-, (2), 5'-[3-(ethoxycarbonyl)butoxy]-, (3), 5'-[3-(ethoxycarbonyl)pentyloxy]-, (4), and 5'-benzyloxy-, (5), derivatives, which are potent and selective for Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase (pcDHFR). Crystal structures are reported for their ternary complexes with NADPH and pcDHFR refined to between 1.4 and 2.0 Å resolution and for that of 3 with human DHFR (hDHFR) to 1.8 Å resolution. These data reveal that the carboxylate of the ω-carboxyalkoxy side chain of 1, the most potent inhibitor in this series, forms ionic interactions with the conserved Arg75 in the substrate-binding pocket of pcDHFR, whereas the less potent ethyl esters of 2-4 bind with variable side-chain conformations. The benzyloxy side chain of 5 makes no contact with Arg75 and is the least active inhibitor in this series. These structural results suggest that the weaker binding of this series compared with that of their pyrimidine homologs in part arises from the flexibility observed in their side-chain conformations, which do not optimize intermolecular contact to Arg75. Structural data for the binding of 3 to both hDHFR and pcDHFR reveals that the inhibitor binds in two different conformations, one similar to each of the two conformations observed for the parent pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine, piritrexim (PTX), bound to hDHFR. The structure of the pcDHFR complex of 4 reveals disorder in the side-chain orientation; one orientation has the ω-carboxyalkoxy side chain positioned in the folate-binding pocket similar to the others in this series, while the second orientation occupies a new site near the nicotinamide ring of NADPH. This alternate binding site has not been observed in other DHFR structures. Structural data for the pcDHFR complex of 5 show that its benzyl side chain forms intermolecular van der Waals interactions with Phe69 in the binding pocket that could account for its enhanced binding selectivity compared with the other analogs in this series.</p>

<p>The first committed step of lipid A biosynthesis is catalyzed by UDP-(3-O-((R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl))-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, a metal-dependent deacetylase also known as LpxC. Because lipid A is essential for bacterial viability, the inhibition of LpxC is an appealing therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Here we report the 1.79 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of LpxC from Yersinia enterocolitica (YeLpxC) complexed with the potent hydroxamate inhibitor CHIR-090. This enzyme is a nearly identical orthologue of LpxC from Yersinia pestis (99.7% sequence identity), the pathogen that causes bubonic plague. Similar to the inhibition of LpxC from Escherichia coli, CHIR-090 inhibits YeLpxC via a two-step slow, tight-binding mechanism with an apparent K(i) of 0.54 ± 0.14 nM followed by conversion of the E·I to E·I* species with a rate constant of 0.11 ± 0.01 min(-1). The structure of the LpxC complex with CHIR-090 shows that the inhibitor hydroxamate group chelates the active site zinc ion, and the "tail" of the inhibitor binds in the hydrophobic tunnel in the active site. This hydrophobic tunnel is framed by a βαβ subdomain that exhibits significant conformational flexibility as it accommodates inhibitor binding. CHIR-090 displays a 27 mm zone of inhibition against Y. enterocolitica in a Kirby-Bauer antibiotic assay, which is comparable to its reported activity against other Gram-negative species including E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study demonstrates that the inhibition of LpxC should be explored as a potential therapeutic and/or prophylatic response to infection by weaponized Yersinia species.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of many enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily determined in the presence of bound NAD(P)(+) have exhibited conformational flexibility for the nicotinamide half of the cofactor. This has been hypothesized to be important in catalysis because one conformation would block the second half of the reaction, but no firm evidence has been put forth which shows whether the oxidized and reduced cofactors preferentially occupy the two observed conformations. We present here two structures of the wild type and two structures of a Cys302Ser mutant of human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in binary complexes with NAD(+) and NADH. These structures, including the Cys302Ser mutant in complex with NAD(+) at 1.4 A resolution and the wild-type enzyme in complex with NADH at 1.9 A resolution, provide strong evidence that bound NAD(+) prefers an extended conformation ideal for hydride transfer and bound NADH prefers a contracted conformation ideal for acyl-enzyme hydrolysis. Unique interactions between the cofactor and the Rossmann fold make isomerization possible while allowing the remainder of the active site complex to remain intact. In addition, these structures clarify the role of magnesium in activating the human class 2 enzyme. Our data suggest that the presence of magnesium may lead to selection of particular conformations and speed isomerization of the reduced cofactor following hydride transfer.</p>

<p>The structure of RNase P protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima was determined at 1.2-A resolution by using x-ray crystallography. This protein structure is from an ancestral-type RNase P and bears remarkable similarity to the recently determined structures of RNase P proteins from bacteria that have the distinct, Bacillus type of RNase P. These two types of protein span the extent of bacterial RNase P diversity, so the results generalize the structure of the bacterial RNase P protein. The broad phylogenetic conservation of structure and distribution of potential RNA-binding elements in the RNase P proteins indicate that all of these homologous proteins bind to their cognate RNAs primarily by interaction with the phylogenetically conserved core of the RNA. The protein is found to dimerize through an extensive, well-ordered interface. This dimerization may reflect a mechanism of thermal stability of the protein before assembly with the RNA moiety of the holoenzyme.</p>

<p>A general approach for the computational design of enzymes to catalyze arbitrary reactions is a goal at the forefront of the field of protein design. Recently, computationally designed enzymes have been produced for three chemical reactions through the synthesis and screening of a large number of variants. Here, we present an iterative approach that has led to the development of the most catalytically efficient computationally designed enzyme for the Kemp elimination to date. Previously established computational techniques were used to generate an initial design, HG-1, which was catalytically inactive. Analysis of HG-1 with molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and X-ray crystallography indicated that the inactivity might be due to bound waters and high flexibility of residues within the active site. This analysis guided changes to our design procedure, moved the design deeper into the interior of the protein, and resulted in an active Kemp eliminase, HG-2. The cocrystal structure of this enzyme with a transition state analog (TSA) revealed that the TSA was bound in the active site, interacted with the intended catalytic base in a catalytically relevant manner, but was flipped relative to the design model. MD analysis of HG-2 led to an additional point mutation, HG-3, that produced a further threefold improvement in activity. This iterative approach to computational enzyme design, including detailed MD and structural analysis of both active and inactive designs, promises a more complete understanding of the underlying principles of enzymatic catalysis and furthers progress toward reliably producing active enzymes.</p>

<p>Prokaryotic genes related to the oxygenase domain of mammalian nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) have recently been identified. Although they catalyze the same reaction as the eukaryotic NOS oxygenase domain, their biological function(s) are unknown. In order to explore rationally the biochemistry and evolution of the prokaryotic NOS family, we have determined the crystal structure of SANOS, from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), to 2.4 A. Haem and S-ethylisothiourea (SEITU) are bound at the SANOS active site, while the intersubunit site, occupied by the redox cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (H(4)B) in mammalian NOSs, has NAD(+) bound in SANOS. In common with all bacterial NOSs, SANOS lacks the N-terminal extension responsible for stable dimerization in mammalian isoforms, but has alternative interactions to promote dimer formation.</p>

<p>The flavoenzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) eliminates the alpha-proton of the substrate analog, 3-thiaoctanoyl-CoA (3S-C8-CoA), to form a charge-transfer complex with deprotonated 3S-C8-CoA. This complex can simulate the metastable reaction intermediate immediately after the alpha-proton elimination of a substrate and before the beta-hydrogen transfer as a hydride, and is therefore regarded as a transition-state analog. The crystalline complex was obtained by co-crystallizing MCAD in the oxidized form with 3S-C8-CoA. The three-dimensional structure of the complex was solved by X-ray crystallography. The deprotonated 3S-C8-CoA was clearly located within the active-site cleft of the enzyme. The arrangement between the flavin ring and deprotonated 3S-C8-CoA is consistent with a charge transfer interaction with the negatively charged acyl-chain of 3S-C8-CoA as an electron donor stacking on the pyrimidine moiety of the flavin ring as an electron acceptor. The structure of the model complex between lumiflavin and the deprotonated ethylthioester of 3-thiabutanoic acid was optimized by molecular orbital calculations. The obtained theoretical structure was essentially the same as that of the corresponding region of the X-ray structure. A considerable amount of negative charge is transferred to the flavin ring system to stabilize the complex by 9.2 kcal/mol. The large stabilization energy by charge transfer probably plays an important role in determining the alignment of the flavin ring with 3S-C8-CoA. The structure of the highest occupied molecular orbital of the complex revealed the electron flow pathway from a substrate to the flavin ring.</p>

<p>Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases that regulate metabolism and aging-related processes. Sirt2 is the only cytoplasmic isoform among the seven mamalian Sirtuins (Sirt1-7) and structural information concerning this isoform is limited. We crystallized Sirt2 in complex with a product analog, ADP-ribose, and solved this first crystal structure of a Sirt2 ligand complex at 2.3Å resolution. Additionally, we re-refined the structure of the Sirt2 apoform and analyzed the conformational changes associated with ligand binding to derive insights into the dynamics of the enzyme. Our analyses also provide information on Sirt2 peptide substrate binding and structural states of a Sirt2-specific protein region, and our insights and the novel Sirt2 crystal form provide helpful tools for the development of Sirt2 specific inhibitors.</p>

<p>Uridine-cytidine nucleoside kinase 2 (UCK2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine-nucleotide salvage pathway. UCK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of the natural ribonucleosides cytidine and uridine to cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP) and uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP), respectively, and activates several important frontline antimetabolite drugs. The present contribution reports the rapid crystal structure determination of human UCK2 complexed with a magnesium ion and the reaction products adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and CMP. Diffraction data were collected on a copper rotating-anode X-ray generator from one native UCK2 crystal and a single samarium-derivative crystal. Utilizing the relatively high anomalous signal from the samarium derivative at the Cu Kalpha wavelength, the structure was determined by single isomorphous replacement and single anomalous signal (SIRAS) phasing techniques. Two of the four major samarium sites are located in the active sites of the two UCK2 molecules that form the asymmetric unit and appear to displace the magnesium ions present in the native crystals. The crystal structures of UCK2 alone and in complex with various ligands have recently been determined using traditional multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) phasing techniques and data from three heavy-atom derivatives. The reported structures validate our independently determined structure. Of more than 1000 kinase crystal structure entries in the Protein Data Bank, less than 1% of them have been determined by SIRAS. For the published kinase crystal structures determined by SIRAS, all data were reportedly collected at various synchrotron-radiation facilities. This study demonstrates that diffraction data collected from a single samarium derivative using Cu Kalpha radiation provides sufficient phasing power to determine a novel macromolecular crystal structure.</p>

<p>Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) is a functionally dimeric ligase, which specifically couples hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate to the formation of an ester bond between tryptophan and the cognate tRNA. TrpRS from Bacillus stearothermophilus binds the ATP analogue, adenosine-5' tetraphosphate (AQP) competitively with ATP during pyrophosphate exchange. Estimates of binding affinity from this competitive inhibition and from isothermal titration calorimetry show that AQP binds 200 times more tightly than ATP both under conditions of induced-fit, where binding is coupled to an unfavorable conformational change, and under exchange conditions, where there is no conformational change. These binding data provide an indirect experimental measurement of +3.0 kcal/mol for the conformational free energy change associated with induced-fit assembly of the active site. Thermodynamic parameters derived from the calorimetry reveal very modest enthalpic changes, consistent with binding driven largely by a favorable entropy change. The 2.5 A structure of the TrpRS:AQP complex, determined de novo by X-ray crystallography, resembles that of the previously described, pre-transition state TrpRS:ATP complexes. The anticodon-binding domain untwists relative to the Rossmann-fold domain by 20% of the way toward the orientation observed for the Products complex. An unexpected tetraphosphate conformation allows the gamma and deltad phosphate groups to occupy positions equivalent to those occupied by the beta and gamma phosphates of ATP. The beta-phosphate effects a 1.11 A extension that relocates the alpha-phosphate toward the tryptophan carboxylate while the PPi mimic moves deeper into the KMSKS loop. This configuration improves interactions between enzyme and nucleotide significantly and uniformly in the adenosine and PPi binding subsites. A new hydrogen bond forms between S194 from the class I KMSKS signature sequence and the PPi mimic. These complementary thermodynamic and structural data are all consistent with the conclusion that the tetraphosphate mimics a transition-state in which the KMSKS loop develops increasingly tight bonds to the PPi leaving group, weakening linkage to the Palpha as it is relocated by an energetically favorable domain movement. Consistent with extensive mutational data on Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, this aspect of the mechanism develops high transition-state affinity for the adenosine and pyrophosphate moieties, which move significantly, relative to one another, during the catalytic step.</p>

<p>Quinone reductase 2 (QR2) is one of two members comprising the mammalian quinone reductase family of enzymes responsible for performing FAD mediated reductions of quinone substrates. In contrast to quinone reductase 1 (QR1) which uses NAD(P)H as its co-substrate, QR2 utilizes a rare group of hydride donors, N-methyl or N-ribosyl nicotinamide. Several studies have linked QR2 to the generation of quinone free radicals, several neuronal degenerative diseases, and cancer. QR2 has been also identified as the third melatonin receptor (MT3) through in cellulo and in vitro inhibition of QR2 by traditional MT3 ligands, and through recent X-ray structures of human QR2 (hQR2) in complex with melatonin and 2-iodomelatonin. Several MT3 specific ligands have been developed that exhibit both potent in cellulo inhibition of hQR2 nanomolar, affinity for MT3. The potency of these ligands suggest their use as molecular probes for hQR2. However, no definitive correlation between traditionally obtained MT3 ligand affinity and hQR2 inhibition exists limiting our understanding of how these ligands are accommodated in the hQR2 active site. To obtain a clearer relationship between the structures of developed MT3 ligands and their inhibitory properties, in cellulo and in vitro IC₅₀ values were determined for a representative set of MT3 ligands (MCA-NAT, 2-I-MCANAT, prazosin, S26695, S32797, and S29434). Furthermore, X-ray structures for each of these ligands in complex with hQR2 were determined allowing for a structural evaluation of the binding modes of these ligands in relation to the potency of MT3 ligands.</p>

<p>CCA-adding enzymes [ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferases] add CCA onto the 3' end of transfer RNA (tRNA) precursors without using a nucleic acid template. Although the mechanism by which cytosine (C) is selected at position 75 of tRNA has been established, the mechanism by which adenine (A) is selected at position 76 remains elusive. Here, we report five cocrystal structures of the enzyme complexed with both a tRNA mimic and nucleoside triphosphates under catalytically active conditions. These structures suggest that adenosine 5'-monophosphate is incorporated onto the A76 position of the tRNA via a carboxylate-assisted, one-metal-ion mechanism with aspartate 110 functioning as a general base. The discrimination against incorporation of cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP) at position 76 arises from improper placement of the α phosphate of the incoming CTP, which results from the interaction of C with arginine 224 and prevents the nucleophilic attack by the 3' hydroxyl group of cytidine75.</p>

<p>Tremendous gains and novel methods are often developed when people are challenged to do something new or difficult. This process is enhanced when people compete against each other-this can be seen in sport as well as in science and technology (e.g. the space race). The SAMPL challenges, like the CASP challenges, aim to challenge modellers and software developers to develop new ways of looking at molecular interactions so the community as a whole can progress in the accurate prediction of these interactions. In order for this challenge to occur, data must be supplied so the prospective test can be done. We have supplied unpublished data related to a drug discovery program run several years ago on HIV integrase for the SAMPL4 challenge. This paper describes the methods used to obtain these data and the chemistry involved.</p>

<p>The trifluoromethylphenyl P2 motif from previously reported heteroarylnitrile series has been successfully applied for the design and synthesis of highly potent novel ketoamide-based cathepsin S inhibitors. The key in this process is the change of the torsion angle between the P2 phenyl ring and the attached secondary amide by adding a small Cl, F, or Me group at the 2-position.</p>

<p>Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) are a physiologically important class of membrane-bound ectonucleotidases responsible for the regulation of extracellular levels of nucleotides. CD39 or NTPDase1 is the dominant NTPDase of the vasculature. By hydrolyzing proinflammatory ATP and platelet-activating ADP to AMP, it blocks platelet aggregation and supports blood flow. Thus, great interest exists in understanding the structure and dynamics of this prototype member of the eukaryotic NTPDase family. Here, we report the crystal structure of a variant of soluble NTPDase1 lacking a putative membrane interaction loop identified between the two lobes of the catalytic domain. ATPase and ADPase activities of this variant are determined via a newly established kinetic isothermal titration calorimetry assay and compared to that of the soluble NTPDase1 variant characterized previously. Complex structures with decavanadate and heptamolybdate show that both polyoxometallates bind electrostatically to a loop that is involved in binding of the nucleobase. In addition, a comparison of the domain orientations of the four independent proteins in the crystal asymmetric unit provides the first direct experimental evidence for a domain motion of NTPDases. An interdomain rotation angle of up to 7.4° affects the active site cleft between the two lobes of the protein. Comparison with a previously solved bacterial NTPDase structure indicates that the domains may undergo relative rotational movements of more than 20°. Our data support the idea that the influence of transmembrane helix dynamics on activity is achieved by coupling to a domain motion.</p>

<p>The degradation of the plant cell wall by glycoside hydrolases is central to environmentally sustainable industries. The major polysaccharides of the plant cell wall are cellulose and xylan, a highly decorated β-1,4-xylopyranose polymer. Glycoside hydrolases displaying multiple catalytic functions may simplify the enzymes required to degrade plant cell walls, increasing the industrial potential of these composite structures. Here we test the hypothesis that glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH43) provides a suitable scaffold for introducing additional catalytic functions into enzymes that target complex structures in the plant cell wall. We report the crystal structure of Humicola insolens AXHd3 (HiAXHd3), a GH43 arabinofuranosidase that hydrolyses O3-linked arabinose of doubly substituted xylans, a feature of the polysaccharide that is recalcitrant to degradation. HiAXHd3 displays an N-terminal five-bladed β-propeller domain and a C-terminal β-sandwich domain. The interface between the domains comprises a xylan binding cleft that houses the active site pocket. Substrate specificity is conferred by a shallow arabinose binding pocket adjacent to the deep active site pocket, and through the orientation of the xylan backbone. Modification of the rim of the active site introduces endo-xylanase activity, whereas the resultant enzyme variant, Y166A, retains arabinofuranosidase activity. These data show that the active site of HiAXHd3 is tuned to hydrolyse arabinofuranosyl or xylosyl linkages, and it is the topology of the distal regions of the substrate binding surface that confers specificity. This report demonstrates that GH43 provides a platform for generating bespoke multifunctional enzymes that target industrially significant complex substrates, exemplified by the plant cell wall.</p>

<p>Deacetoxycephalosporin-C synthase (DAOCS) is a mononuclear ferrous enzyme that transforms penicillins into cephalosporins by inserting a carbon atom into the penicillin nucleus. In the first half-reaction, dioxygen and 2-oxoglutarate produce a reactive iron-oxygen species, succinate and CO2. The oxidizing iron species subsequently reacts with penicillin to give cephalosporin and water. Here we describe high-resolution structures for ferrous DAOCS in complex with penicillins, the cephalosporin product, the cosubstrate and the coproduct. Steady-state kinetic data, quantum-chemical calculations and the new structures indicate a reaction sequence in which a 'booby-trapped' oxidizing species is formed. This species is stabilized by the negative charge of succinate on the iron. The binding sites of succinate and penicillin overlap, and when penicillin replaces succinate, it removes the stabilizing charge, eliciting oxidative attack on itself. Requisite groups of penicillin are within 1 A of the expected position of a ferryl oxygen in the enzyme-penicillin complex.</p>

<p>Prokaryotic phosphopentomutases (PPMs) are di-Mn(2+) enzymes that catalyze the interconversion of α-D-ribose 5-phosphate and α-D-ribose 1-phosphate at an active site located between two independently folded domains. These prokaryotic PPMs belong to the alkaline phosphatase superfamily, but previous studies of Bacillus cereus PPM suggested adaptations of the conserved alkaline phosphatase catalytic cycle. Notably, B. cereus PPM engages substrates when the active site nucleophile, Thr-85, is phosphorylated. Further, the phosphoenzyme is stable throughout purification and crystallization. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase engages substrates when the active site nucleophile is dephosphorylated, and the phosphoenzyme reaction intermediate is only stably trapped in a catalytically compromised enzyme. Studies were undertaken to understand the divergence of these mechanisms. Crystallographic and biochemical investigations of the PPM(T85E) phosphomimetic variant and the neutral corollary PPM(T85Q) determined that the side chain of Lys-240 underwent a change in conformation in response to active site charge, which modestly influenced the affinity for the small molecule activator α-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. More strikingly, the structure of unphosphorylated B. cereus PPM revealed a dramatic change in the interdomain angle and a new hydrogen bonding interaction between the side chain of Asp-156 and the active site nucleophile, Thr-85. This hydrogen bonding interaction is predicted to align and activate Thr-85 for nucleophilic addition to α-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, favoring the observed equilibrium phosphorylated state. Indeed, phosphorylation of Thr-85 is severely impaired in the PPM(D156A) variant even under stringent activation conditions. These results permit a proposal for activation of PPM and explain some of the essential features that distinguish between the catalytic cycles of PPM and alkaline phosphatase.</p>

<p>The genus Burkholderia includes pathogenic gram-negative bacteria that cause melioidosis, glanders, and pulmonary infections of patients with cancer and cystic fibrosis. Drug resistance has made development of new antimicrobials critical.

<p>Phospho-CDK2/cyclin A, a kinase that is active in cell cycle S phase, contains an RXL substrate recognition site that is over 40 A from the catalytic site. The role of this recruitment site, which enhances substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency, has been investigated using peptides derived from the natural substrates, namely CDC6 and p107, and a bispeptide inhibitor in which the gamma-phosphate of ATP is covalently attached by a linker to the CDC6 substrate peptide. X-ray studies with a 30-residue CDC6 peptide in complex with pCDK2/cyclin A showed binding of a dodecamer peptide at the recruitment site and a heptapeptide at the catalytic site, but no density for the linking 11 residues. Kinetic studies established that the CDC6 peptide had an 18-fold lower Km compared with heptapeptide substrate and that this effect required the recruitment peptide to be covalently linked to the substrate peptide. X-ray studies with the CDC6 bispeptide showed binding of the dodecamer at the recruitment site and the modified ATP in two alternative conformations at the catalytic site. The CDC6 bispeptide was a potent inhibitor competitive with both ATP and peptide substrate of pCDK2/cyclin A activity against a heptapeptide substrate (Ki = 0.83 nm) but less effective against RXL-containing substrates. We discuss how localization at the recruitment site (KD 0.4 microm) leads to increased catalytic efficiency and the design of a potent inhibitor. The notion of a flexible linker between the sites, which must have more than a minimal number of residues, provides an explanation for recognition and discrimination against different substrates.</p>

<p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a major threat to human health, particularly through hospital acquired infection. The spread of MRSA means that novel targets are required to develop potential inhibitors to combat infections caused by such drug-resistant bacteria. Thymidylate kinase (TMK) is attractive as an antibacterial target as it is essential for providing components for DNA synthesis. Here, we report crystal structures of unliganded and thymidylate-bound forms of S. aureus thymidylate kinase (SaTMK). His-tagged and untagged SaTMK crystallize with differing lattice packing and show variations in conformational states for unliganded and thymidylate (TMP) bound forms. In addition to open and closed forms of SaTMK, an intermediate conformation in TMP binding is observed, in which the site is partially closed. Analysis of these structures indicates a sequence of events upon TMP binding, with helix alpha3 shifting position initially, followed by movement of alpha2 to close the substrate site. In addition, we observe significant conformational differences in the TMP-binding site in SaTMK as compared to available TMK structures from other bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as human TMK. In SaTMK, Arg 48 is situated at the base of the TMP-binding site, close to the thymine ring, whereas a cis-proline occupies the equivalent position in other TMKs. The observed TMK structural differences mean that design of compounds highly specific for the S. aureus enzyme looks possible; such inhibitors could minimize the transfer of drug resistance between different bacterial species.</p>

<p>The combination of an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with an E3 ubiquitin-ligase is essential for ubiquitin modification of a substrate. Moreover, the pairing dictates both the substrate choice and the modification type. The molecular details of generic E3-E2 interactions are well established. Nevertheless, the determinants of selective, specific E3-E2 recognition are not understood. There are ∼40 E2s and ∼600 E3s giving rise to a possible ∼24,000 E3-E2 pairs. Using the Fanconi Anemia pathway exclusive E3-E2 pair, FANCL-Ube2T, we report the atomic structure of the FANCL RING-Ube2T complex, revealing a specific and extensive network of additional electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, we show that these specific interactions are required for selection of Ube2T over other E2s by FANCL. </p>

<p>Onchocerciasis is a debilitating parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. Similar to other helminth parasites, O. volvulus is capable of evading the host's immune responses by a variety of defense mechanisms, including the detoxification activities of the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Additionally, in response to drug treatment, helminth GSTs are highly up-regulated, making them tempting targets both for chemotherapy and for vaccine development. We analyzed the three-dimensional x-ray structure of the major cytosolic GST from O. volvulus (Ov-GST2) in complex with its natural substrate glutathione and its competitive inhibitor S-hexylglutathione at 1.5 and 1.8 angstrom resolution, respectively. From the perspective of the biochemical classification, the Ov-GST2 seems to be related to pi-class GSTs. However, in comparison to other pi-class GSTs, in particular to the host's counterpart, the Ov-GST2 reveals significant and unusual differences in the sequence and overall structure. Major differences can be found in helix alpha-2, an important region for substrate recognition. Moreover, the binding site for the electrophilic co-substrate is spatially increased and more solvent-accessible. These structural alterations are responsible for different substrate specificities and will form the basis of parasite-specific structure-based drug design investigations.</p>

<p>A detailed description of the transition that allosteric enzymes undergo constitutes a major challenge in structural biology. We have succeeded in trapping four distinct allosteric states of a mutant enzyme of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbomylase and determining their structures by X-ray crystallography. The mutant version of aspartate transcarbamoylase in which Glu50 in the catalytic chains was replaced by Ala destabilizes the native R state and shifts the equilibrium towards the T state. This behavior allowed the use of substrate analogs such as phosphonoacetamide and malonate to trap the enzyme in T-like and R-like structures that are distinct from the T-state structure of the wild-type enzyme (as represented by the structure of the enzyme with CTP bound and the R-state structure as represented by the structure with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate bound). These structures shed light on the nature and the order of internal structural rearrangements during the transition from the T to the R state. They also suggest an explanation for diminished activity of the E50A enzyme and for the change in reaction mechanism from ordered to random for this mutant enzyme.</p>

<p>Herein we report a study aimed at discovering a new class of compounds that are able to inhibit Leishmania donovani cell growth. Evaluation of an in-house library of compounds in a whole-cell screening assay highlighted 4-((1-(4-ethylphenyl)-2-methyl-5-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methyl)thiomorpholine (compound 1) as the most active. Enzymatic assays on Leishmania infantum trypanothione reductase (LiTR, belonging to the Leishmania donovani complex) shed light on both the interaction with, and the nature of inhibition by, compound 1. A molecular modeling approach based on docking studies and on the estimation of the binding free energy aided our rationalization of the biological data. Moreover, X-ray crystal structure determination of LiTR in complex with compound 1 confirmed all our results: compound 1 binds to the T(SH)2 binding site, lined by hydrophobic residues such as Trp21 and Met113, as well as residues Glu18 and Tyr110. Analysis of the structure of LiTR in complex with trypanothione shows that Glu18 and Tyr110 are also involved in substrate binding, according to a competitive inhibition mechanism. </p>

<p>An inhibitor of alpha-thrombin was designed on the basis of the X-ray crystal structures of thrombin and trypsin. The design strategy employed the geometric and electrostatic differences between the specificity pockets of the two enzymes. These differences arise due to the replacement of Ser 190 in trypsin by Ala 190 in thrombin. The new inhibitor contained a tryptophan side chain instead of the arginine side chain that is present in the prototypical thrombin inhibitors. This inhibitor had a Ki value of 0.25 microM, displayed more than 400-fold specificity for thrombin over trypsin, and doubled the rat plasma APTT at a concentration of 44.9 microM. The X-ray crystal structure of the inhibitor/alpha-thrombin complex was determined. This represents the first reported three-dimensional structure of a thrombin/ inhibitor complex where the specificity pocket of the enzyme is occupied by a chemical moiety other than a guanidino or an amidino group. As was predicted by the molecular model, the tryptophan side chain docks into the specificity pocket of the enzyme. This finding is in contrast with the indole binding region of thrombin reported earlier [Berliner, L. J., &amp; Shen, Y. Y. L. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 4622-4626]. The lower binding affinity of the new inhibitor for trypsin, compared to that for thrombin, appears to be due to (i) the extra energy required to deform the smaller specificity pocket of trypsin to accommodate the bulky indole group and (ii) the favorable electrostatic interactions of the indole group with the more hydrophobic specificity pocket of thrombin. The neutral indole group may be of pharmacological significance because the severe hypotension and respiratory distress observed following the administration of some thrombin inhibitors have been linked to the positively charged guanidino or amidino functionalities.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the noncovalent complex of bovine thrombin and a fibrinogen-A alpha tridecapeptide substrate analog, G17 psi, in which the scissile bond amide nitrogen of Gly-17f has been replaced by a methylene carbon, has been determined at 2.3 A resolution with an R factor of 17.1%. The geometry of the active site indicates that the crystal structure is a close model of the true Michaelis complex. The three independently determined thrombin/G17 psi complexes in the crystal asymmetric unit reveal novel interactions for the P2' and P3' residues-Pro-18f and Arg-19f, respectively-on the carboxyl-terminal side of the scissile bond and confirm previously observed interactions of the P1 (Arg-16f) through P10 (Asp-7f) positions on the amino-terminal side. The thrombin S2' binding site for Pro-18f, as observed in all three complexes, differs from that predicted by modeling studies and is notable for including two carbonyl oxygens of the thrombin main chain. Arg-19f occupies two binding sites on thrombin, S3'A and S3'B, which have dramatically different placements for the arginyl side chain and carboxyl terminus.</p>

<p>Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe type of malaria, a life-threatening disease affecting the lives of over three billion people. Factors like widespread resistance against available drugs and absence of an effective vaccine are seriously compounding control of the malaria parasite. Thus, there is an urgent need for the identification and validation of new drug targets. The enzymes of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway have been suggested as possible targets for the treatment of malaria. One of these enzymes is spermidine synthase (SPDS, putrescine aminopropyltransferase), which catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl moiety from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) to putrescine, leading to the formation of spermidine and 5'-methylthioadenosine. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of P. falciparum spermidine synthase (pfSPDS) in apo form, in complex with dcAdoMet and two inhibitors, S-adenosyl-1,8-diamino-3-thio-octane (AdoDATO) and trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (4MCHA). The results show that binding of dcAdoMet to pfSPDS stabilizes the conformation of the flexible gatekeeper loop of the enzyme and affects the conformation of the active-site amino acid residues, preparing the protein for binding of the second substrate. The complexes of AdoDATO and 4MCHA with pfSPDS reveal the mode of interactions of these compounds with the enzyme. While AdoDATO essentially fills the entire active-site pocket, 4MCHA only occupies part of it, which suggests that simple modifications of this compound may yield more potent inhibitors of pfSPDS.</p>

<p>Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) is an important enzyme component of the purine recycling pathway. Parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida are unable to synthesize purines de novo and use the salvage pathway for the synthesis of purine bases rendering this biosynthetic pathway an attractive target for antiparasitic drug design. The recombinant human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (hAPRT) structure was resolved in the presence of AMP in the active site to 1.76 A resolution and with the substrates PRPP and adenine simultaneously bound to the catalytic site to 1.83 A resolution. An additional structure was solved containing one subunit of the dimer in the apo-form to 2.10 A resolution. Comparisons of these three hAPRT structures with other 'type I' PRTases revealed several important features of this class of enzymes. Our data indicate that the flexible loop structure adopts an open conformation before and after binding of both substrates adenine and PRPP. Comparative analyses presented here provide structural evidence to propose the role of Glu104 as the residue that abstracts the proton of adenine N9 atom before its nucleophilic attack on the PRPP anomeric carbon. This work leads to new insights to the understanding of the APRT catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>We characterized the mechanism and pharmacodynamics of five structurally distinct inhibitors of d-amino acid oxidase. All inhibitors bound the oxidized form of human enzyme with affinity slightly higher than that of benzoate (Kd ≈ 2-4 μM). Stopped-flow experiments showed that pyrrole-based inhibitors possessed high affinity (Kd ≈ 100-200 nM) and slow release kinetics (k &lt; 0.01 s(-1)) in the presence of substrate, while inhibitors with pendent aromatic groups altered conformations of the active site lid, as evidenced by X-ray crystallography, and showed slower kinetics of association. Rigid bioisosteres of benzoic acid induced a closed-lid conformation, had slower release in the presence of substrate, and were more potent than benzoate. Steady-state d-serine concentrations were described in a PK/PD model, and competition for d-serine sites on NMDA receptors was demonstrated in vivo. DAAO inhibition increased the spatiotemporal influence of glial-derived d-serine, suggesting localized effects on neuronal circuits where DAAO can exert a neuromodulatory role.</p>

<p>Cyclodextrin-based host-guest chemistry has been exploited to facilitate co-crystallization of recombinant human acid β-glucosidase (β-glucocerebrosidase, GlcCerase) with amphiphilic bicyclic nojirimycin analogues of the sp(2)-iminosugar type. Attempts to co-crystallize GlcCerase with 5-N,6-O-[N'-(n-octyl)iminomethylidene]nojirimycin (NOI-NJ) or with 5-N,6-S-[N'-(n-octyl)iminomethylidene]-6-thionojirimycin (6S-NOI-NJ), two potent inhibitors of the enzyme with promising pharmacological chaperone activity for several Gaucher disease-associated mutations, were unsuccessful probably due to the formation of aggregates that increase the heterogeneity of the sample and affect nucleation and growth of crystals. Cyclomaltoheptaose (β-cyclodextrin, βCD) efficiently captures NOI-NJ and 6S-NOI-NJ in aqueous media to form inclusion complexes in which the lipophilic tail is accommodated in the hydrophobic cavity of the cyclooligosaccharide. The dissociation constant of the complex of the amphiphilic sp(2)-iminosugars with βCD is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding complex with GlcCerase, allowing the efficient transfer of the inhibitor from the βCD cavity to the GlcCerase active site. Enzyme-inhibitor complexes suitable for X-ray analysis were thus grown in the presence of βCD. In contrast to what was previously observed for the complex of GlcCerase with the more basic derivative, 6-amino-6-deoxy-5-N,6-N-[N'-(n-octyl)iminomethylidene]nojirimycin (6N-NOI-NJ), the β-anomers of both NOI-NJ and 6S-NOI-NJ were seen in the active site, even though the α-anomer was exclusively detected both in aqueous solution and in the corresponding βCD:sp(2)-iminosugar complexes. Our results further suggest that cyclodextrin derivatives might serve as suitable delivery systems of amphiphilic glycosidase inhibitors in a biomedical context.</p>

<p>Activation of the complement cascade induces inflammatory responses and marks cells for immune clearance. In the central complement-amplification step, a complex consisting of surface-bound C3b and factor B is cleaved by factor D to generate active convertases on targeted surfaces. We present crystal structures of the pro-convertase C3bB at 4 angstrom resolution and its complex with factor D at 3.5 angstrom resolution. Our data show how factor B binding to C3b forms an open "activation" state of C3bB. Factor D specifically binds the open conformation of factor B through a site distant from the catalytic center and is activated by the substrate, which displaces factor D's self-inhibitory loop. This concerted proteolytic mechanism, which is cofactor-dependent and substrate-induced, restricts complement amplification to C3b-tagged target cells.</p>

<p>The class II chelatases associated with heme, siroheme, and cobalamin biosynthesis are structurally related enzymes that insert a specific metal ion (Fe(2+) or Co(2+)) into the center of a modified tetrapyrrole (protoporphyrin or sirohydrochlorin). The structures of two related class II enzymes, CbiX(S) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus and CbiK from Salmonella enterica, that are responsible for the insertion of cobalt along the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway are presented in complex with their metallated product. A further structure of a CbiK from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough reveals how cobalt is bound at the active site. The crystal structures show that the binding of sirohydrochlorin is distinctly different to porphyrin binding in the protoporphyrin ferrochelatases and provide a molecular overview of the mechanism of chelation. The structures also give insights into the evolution of chelatase form and function. Finally, the structure of a periplasmic form of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough CbiK reveals a novel tetrameric arrangement of its subunits that are stabilized by the presence of a heme b cofactor. Whereas retaining colbaltochelatase activity, this protein has acquired a central cavity with the potential to chaperone or transport metals across the periplasmic space, thereby evolving a new use for an ancient protein subunit.</p>

<p>As a mechanism-based inactivator of PLP-enzymes, (S)-4-amino-4,5-dihydro-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (SADTA) was cocrystallized with Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (l-AspAT) at a series of pH values ranging from 6 to 8. Five structural models with high resolution (1.4-1.85 A) were obtained for l-AspAT-SADTA complexes at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. Electron densities of the models showed that two different adducts had formed in the active sites. One adduct was formed from SADTA covalently linked to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) while the other adduct was formed with the inhibitor covalently linked to Lysine246,1 the active site lysine. Moreover, there is a strong indication based on the electron densities that the occurrence of the two adducts is pH dependent. We conclude that SADTA inactivates l-AspAT via two different mechanisms based on the binding direction of the inactivator. Additionally, the structural models also show pH dependence of the protein structure itself, which provided detailed mechanistic implications for l-AspAT.</p>

<p>Cyclic urea amides, a novel series of HIV-1 protease (HIV PR) inhibitors, have increased activity against drug-resistant mutants of the HIV PR. The design strategy for these inhibitors is based on the hypotheses that (i) the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the inhibitor and the protease backbone will remain constant for wild-type and mutant enzymes and (ii) inhibitors which are capable of forming many nonbonded interactions, distributed throughout the active site, will experience a lower percent change in binding energy as a result of mutation in the target enzyme than those that form fewer interactions by partial occupation of the active site. The cyclic urea amide, SD146, forms 14 hydrogen bonds and 191 van der Waals contacts to HIV PR. SD146 is a very potent antiviral agent (IC90 = 5.1 nM) against wild-type HIV and maintains the same or improved level of high potency against a range of mutant strains of HIV with resistance to a wide variety of HIV protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>As a mechanism-based inactivator of PLP-enzymes, (S)-4-amino-4,5-dihydro-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (SADTA) was cocrystallized with Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (l-AspAT) at a series of pH values ranging from 6 to 8. Five structural models with high resolution (1.4-1.85 A) were obtained for l-AspAT-SADTA complexes at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. Electron densities of the models showed that two different adducts had formed in the active sites. One adduct was formed from SADTA covalently linked to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) while the other adduct was formed with the inhibitor covalently linked to Lysine246,1 the active site lysine.

<p>NAD(+)-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the oxidation of formate ion to carbon dioxide coupled with the reduction of NAD(+) to NADH. The crystal structures of the apo and holo forms of FDH from the methylotrophic bacterium Moraxella sp. C-1 (MorFDH) are reported at 1.96 and 1.95 A resolution, respectively. MorFDH is similar to the previously studied FDH from the bacterium Pseudomonas sp. 101 in overall structure, cofactor-binding mode and active-site architecture, but differs in that the eight-residue-longer C-terminal fragment is visible in the electron-density maps of MorFDH. MorFDH also differs in the organization of the dimer interface. The holo MorFDH structure supports the earlier hypothesis that the catalytic residue His332 can form a hydrogen bond to both the substrate and the transition state. Apo MorFDH has a closed conformation of the interdomain cleft, which is unique for an apo form of an NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase. A comparison of the structures of bacterial FDH in open and closed conformations allows the differentiation of the conformational changes associated with cofactor binding and domain motion and provides insights into the mechanism of the closure of the interdomain cleft in FDH. The C-terminal residues 374-399 and the substrate (formate ion) or inhibitor (azide ion) binding are shown to play an essential role in the transition from the open to the closed conformation.</p>

<p>Macrophage infectivity potentiators (Mips) are immunophilin proteins and essential virulence factors for a range of pathogenic organisms. We applied a structural biology approach to characterize a Mip from Burkholderia pseudomallei (BpML1), the causative agent of melioidosis. Crystal structure and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of BpML1 in complex with known macrocyclics and other derivatives led to the identification of a key chemical scaffold. This scaffold possesses inhibitory potency for BpML1 without the immunosuppressive components of related macrocyclic agents. Biophysical characterization of a compound series with this scaffold allowed binding site specificity in solution and potency determinations for rank ordering the set. The best compounds in this series possessed a low-micromolar affinity for BpML1, bound at the site of enzymatic activity, and inhibited a panel of homologous Mip proteins from other pathogenic bacteria, without demonstrating toxicity in human macrophages. Importantly, the in vitro activity of BpML1 was reduced by these compounds, leading to decreased macrophage infectivity and intracellular growth of Burkholderia pseudomallei. These compounds offer the potential for activity against a new class of antimicrobial targets and present the utility of a structure-based approach for novel antimicrobial drug discovery. </p>

<p>Human estrogenic 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD1), a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, is responsible for the biosynthesis of all active estrogens. The crystal structures of two C19-steroid ternary complexes (17beta-HSD1-androstanedione-NADP and 17beta-HSD1-androstenedione-NADP) reveal the critical role of Leu149 in regulating the substrate specificity and provide novel insight into the different fates of a conserved glutamate residue in the estrogen-specific proteins upon the binding of the keto and hydroxyl groups of steroids. The whole NADP molecule can be unambiguously defined in the NADP binary complex, whereas both ternary complexes show that the nicotinamide moiety of NADP cannot be located in the density maps. In both ternary complexes, the expected position of carboxamide oxygen of NADP is occupied by a water molecule, which makes a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the O3 of C19-steroid and the main chain nitrogen of Val188. These results demonstrate that the hydrogen bonding interaction between the main chain amide group and the carboxamide group of NAD(P)(H) plays an important role in anchoring the nicotinamide ring to the enzyme. This finding is substantiated by structural analyses of all 33 NAD(P)(H) complexes of different SDR proteins, because 29 structures of 33 show this interaction. This common feature reveals a general mechanism among the SDR family, providing a rational basis for inhibitor design against biologically relevant SDR targets.</p>

<p>Signal transduction, regulatory processes and pharmaceutical responses are highly dependent upon ligand residence times. Gaining insight into how physical factors influence residence times (1/k(off)) should enhance our ability to manipulate biological interactions. We report experiments that yield structural insight into k(off) involving a series of eight 2,4-diaminopyrimidine inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase whose binding affinities vary by six orders of magnitude. NMR relaxation-dispersion experiments revealed a common set of residues near the binding site that undergo a concerted millisecond-timescale switching event to a previously unidentified conformation. The rate of switching from ground to excited conformations correlates exponentially with the binding affinity K(i) and k(off), suggesting that protein dynamics serves as a mechanical initiator of ligand dissociation within this series and potentially for other macromolecule-ligand systems. Although the forward rate of conformational exchange, k(conf,forward), is faster than k(off), the use of the ligand series allowed for connections to be drawn between kinetic events on different timescales.</p>

<p>C1r is a modular serine protease which is the autoactivating component of the C1 complex of the classical pathway of the complement system. We have determined the first crystal structure of the entire active catalytic region of human C1r. This fragment contains the C-terminal serine protease (SP) domain and the preceding two complement control protein (CCP) modules. The activated CCP1-CCP2-SP fragment makes up a dimer in a head-to-tail fashion similarly to the previously characterized zymogen. The present structure shows an increased number of stabilizing interactions. Moreover, in the crystal lattice there is an enzyme-product relationship between the C1r molecules of neighboring dimers. This enzyme-product complex exhibits the crucial S1-P1 salt bridge between Asp631 and Arg446 residues, and intermolecular interaction between the CCP2 module and the SP domain. Based on these novel structural information we propose a new split-and-reassembly model for the autoactivation of the C1r. This model is consistent with experimental results that have not been explained adequately by previous models. It allows autoactivation of C1r without large-scale, directed movement of C1q arms. The model is concordant with the stability of the C1 complex during activation of the next complement components.</p>

<p>Two new X-ray structures of an HIV-1 protease mutant (A71V, V82T, I84V) in complex with inhibitors SE and SQ, pseudotetrapeptide inhibitors with an acyclic S-hydroxyethylamine isostere, were determined. Comparison of eight structures exploring the binding of four similar inhibitors--SE, SQ (S-hydroxyethylamine isostere), OE (ethyleneamine), and QF34 (hydroxyethylene)--to wild-type and A71V/V82T/I84V HIV-1 protease elucidates the principles of altered interaction with changing conditions. The A71V mutation, which is distant from the active site, causes changes in the structure of the enzyme detectable by the means of X-ray structure analysis, and a route of propagation of the effect toward the active site is proposed.</p>

<p>Understanding the catalytic efficiency and specificity of enzymes is a fundamental question of major practical and conceptual importance in biochemistry. Although progress in biochemical and structural studies has enriched our knowledge of enzymes, the role in enzyme catalysis of residues that are not nearest neighbors of the reacting substrate molecule is largely unexplored experimentally. Here computational active site predictors, THEMATICS and POOL, were employed to identify functionally important residues that are not in direct contact with the reacting substrate molecule. These predictions then guided experiments to explore the active sites of two isomerases, Pseudomonas putida ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) and human phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), as prototypes for very different types of predicted active sites. Both KSI and PGI are members of EC 5.3 and catalyze similar reactions, but they represent significantly different degrees of remote residue participation, as predicted by THEMATICS and POOL. For KSI, a compact active site of mostly first-shell residues is predicted, but for PGI, an extended active site in which residues in the first, second, and third layers around the reacting substrate are predicted. Predicted residues that have not been previously tested experimentally were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. In human PGI, single-point mutations of the predicted second- and third-shell residues K362, H100, E495, D511, H396, and Q388 show significant decreases in catalytic activity relative to that of the wild type. The results of these experiments demonstrate that, as predicted, remote residues are very important in PGI catalysis but make only small contributions to catalysis in KSI.</p>

<p>Tankyrases are ADP-ribosyltransferases that play key roles in various cellular pathways, including the regulation of cell proliferation, and thus, they are promising drug targets for the treatment of cancer. Flavones have been shown to inhibit tankyrases and we report here the discovery of more potent and selective flavone derivatives. Commercially available flavones with single substitutions were used for structure-activity relationship studies, and cocrystal structures of the 18 hit compounds were analyzed to explain their potency and selectivity. The most potent inhibitors were also tested in a cell-based assay, which demonstrated that they effectively antagonize Wnt signaling. To assess selectivity, they were further tested against a panel of homologous human ADP-ribosyltransferases. The most effective compound, 22 (MN-64), showed 6 nM potency against tankyrase 1, isoenzyme selectivity, and Wnt signaling inhibition. This work forms a basis for rational development of flavones as tankyrase inhibitors and guides the development of other structurally related inhibitors. </p>

<p>Many studies have shown that the dynamic motions of individual protein segments can play an important role in enzyme function. Recent structural studies of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) demonstrate that PEPCK contains a 10-residue Omega-loop domain that acts as an active site lid. On the basis of these structural studies, we have previously proposed a model for the mechanism of PEPCK catalysis in which the conformation of this mobile lid domain is energetically coupled to ligand binding, resulting in the closed conformation of the lid, necessary for correct substrate positioning, becoming more energetically favorable as ligands associate with the enzyme. Here we test this model by introducing a point mutation (A467G) into the center of the Omega-loop lid that is designed to increase the entropic penalty for lid closure. Structural and kinetic characterization of this mutant enzyme demonstrates that the mutation has decreased the favorability of the enzyme adapting the closed lid conformation. As a consequence of this shift in the equilibrium defining the conformation of the active site lid, the enzyme's ability to stabilize the reaction intermediate is weakened, resulting in catalytic defect. This stabilization is initially surprising, as the lid domain makes no direct contacts with the enolate intermediate formed during the reaction. Furthermore, during the conversion of OAA to PEP, the destabilization of the lid-closed conformation results in the reaction becoming decoupled as the enolate intermediate is protonated rather than phosphorylated, resulting in the formation of pyruvate. Taken together, the structural and kinetic characterization of A467G-PEPCK supports our model of the role of the active site lid in catalytic function and demonstrates that the shift in the lowest-energy conformation between open and closed lid states is a function of the free energy available to the enzyme through ligand binding and the entropic penalty for ordering of the 10-residue Omega-loop lid domain.</p>

<p>Dynamic histone lysine methylation involves the activities of modifying enzymes (writers), enzymes removing modifications (erasers), and readers of the histone code. One common feature of these activities is the recognition of lysines in methylated and unmethylated states, whether they are substrates, reaction products, or binding partners. We applied the concept of adding a lysine mimic to an established inhibitor (BIX-01294) of histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferases G9a and G9a-like protein by including a 5-aminopentyloxy moiety, which is inserted into the target lysine-binding channel and becomes methylated by G9a-like protein, albeit slowly. The compound enhances its potency in vitro and reduces cell toxicity in vivo. We suggest that adding a lysine or methyl-lysine mimic should be considered in the design of small-molecule inhibitors for other methyl-lysine writers, erasers, and readers.</p>

<p>Thiazide diuretics inhibit all mammalian isoforms of carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) with a different profile as compared to classical inhibitors. Acting as moderate-weak inhibitors of CA II and CA I, chlorthalidone and indapamide considerably inhibit other isozymes among the 16 CAs present in vertebrates. These compounds show a different behavior against CAs I and II, with chlorthalidone being 18.3 times more potent against CA II and 150 times more potent against CA I, as compared to indapamide. In the X-ray crystal structures of the CA II-chlorthalidone adduct three active site water molecules interacting with the inhibitor scaffold were observed that lack in the corresponding indapamide adduct. Chlorthalidone bound within the active site is in an enolic tautomeric form, with the OH moiety participating in two strong hydrogen bonds with Asn67 and a water molecule. This binding mode may be exploited for designing better CA II inhibitors.</p>

<p>Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by eukaryotic Babesia parasites which are morphologically similar to Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria in humans. Like Plasmodium, different species of Babesia are tuned to infect different mammalian hosts, including rats, dogs, horses and cattle. Most species of Plasmodium and Babesia possess an essential bifunctional enzyme for nucleotide synthesis and folate metabolism: dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase. Although thymidylate synthase is highly conserved across organisms, the bifunctional form of this enzyme is relatively uncommon in nature. The structural characterization of dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase in Babesia bovis, the causative agent of babesiosis in livestock cattle, is reported here. The apo state is compared with structures that contain dUMP, NADP and two different antifolate inhibitors: pemetrexed and raltitrexed. The complexes reveal modes of binding similar to that seen in drug-resistant malaria strains and point to the utility of applying structural studies with proven cancer chemotherapies towards infectious disease research.</p>

<p>Bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a multifunctional biotin-dependent enzyme that consists of three separate proteins: biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and carboxyltransferase (CT). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a potentially attractive target for novel antibiotics because it catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis. In the first half-reaction, BC catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of BCCP. In the second half-reaction, the carboxyl group is transferred from carboxybiotinylated BCCP to acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. A series of structures of BC from several bacteria crystallized in the presence of various ATP analogs is described that addresses three major questions concerning the catalytic mechanism. The structure of BC bound to AMPPNP and the two catalytically essential magnesium ions resolves inconsistencies between the kinetics of active-site BC mutants and previously reported BC structures. Another structure of AMPPNP bound to BC shows the polyphosphate chain folded back on itself, and not in the correct (i.e., extended) conformation for catalysis. This provides the first structural evidence for the hypothesis of substrate-induced synergism, which posits that ATP binds nonproductively to BC in the absence of biotin. The BC homodimer has been proposed to exhibit half-sites reactivity where the active sites alternate or "flip-flop" their catalytic cycles. A crystal structure of BC showed the ATP analog AMPPCF(2)P bound to one subunit while the other subunit was unliganded. The liganded subunit was in the closed or catalytic conformation while the unliganded subunit was in the open conformation. This provides the first structural evidence for half-sites reactivity in BC.</p>

<p>Vitamin D3 hydroxylase (Vdh) from Pseudonocardia autotrophica is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the two-step hydroxylation of vitamin D3 (VD3 ) to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)VD3 ) and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2 VD3 ). These hydroxylated forms of VD3 are useful as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of conditions associated with VD3 deficiency and VD3 metabolic disorder. Herein, we describe the creation of a highly active T107A mutant of Vdh by engineering the putative ferredoxin-binding site. Crystallographic and kinetic analyses indicate that the T107A mutation results in conformational change from an open to a closed state, thereby increasing the binding affinity with ferredoxin. We also report the efficient biocatalytic synthesis of 25(OH)VD3 , a promising intermediate for the synthesis of various hydroxylated VD3 derivatives, by using nisin-treated Rhodococcus erythropolis cells containing VdhT107A . The gene-expression cassette encoding Bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase-IV was inserted into the R. erythropolis chromosome and expressed to avoid exhaustion of NADH in a cytoplasm during bioconversion. As a result, approximately 573 μg mL(-1) 25(OH)VD3 was successfully produced by a 2 h bioconversion.</p>

<p>The genomes of aerobic organisms suffer chronic oxidation of guanine to the genotoxic product 8-oxoguanine (oxoG). Replicative DNA polymerases misread oxoG residues and insert adenine instead of cytosine opposite the oxidized base. Both bases in the resulting A*oxoG mispair are mutagenic lesions, and both must undergo base-specific replacement to restore the original C*G pair. Doing so represents a formidable challenge to the DNA repair machinery, because adenine makes up roughly 25% of the bases in most genomes. The evolutionarily conserved enzyme adenine DNA glycosylase (called MutY in bacteria and hMYH in humans) initiates repair of A*oxoG to C*G by removing the inappropriately paired adenine base from the DNA backbone. A central issue concerning MutY function is the mechanism by which A*oxoG mispairs are targeted among the vast excess of A*T pairs. Here we report the use of disulphide crosslinking to obtain high-resolution crystal structures of MutY-DNA lesion-recognition complexes. These structures reveal the basis for recognizing both lesions in the A*oxoG pair and for catalysing removal of the adenine base.</p>

<p>Making new ligands for a given protein by in situ ligation of building blocks (or fragments) is an attractive method. However, it suffers from inherent limitations, such as the limited number of available chemical reactions and the low information content of usual chemical library deconvolution. Here, we describe a focused screening of adenosine derivatives using X-ray crystallography. We discovered an unexpected and biocompatible chemical reactivity and have simultaneously identified the mode of binding of the resulting products. We observed that the NAD kinase from Listeria monocytogenes (LmNADK1) can promote amide formation between 5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine and carboxylic acid groups. This unexpected reactivity allowed us to bridge in situ two adenosine derivatives to fully occupy the active NAD site.

<p>ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) catalyzes the divalent metal ion-dependent hydrolysis of ADP-ribose to ribose 5'-phosphate and AMP. This enzyme plays a key role in regulating the intracellular ADP-ribose levels, and prevents nonenzymatic ADP-ribosylation. To elucidate the pyrophosphatase hydrolysis mechanism employed by this enzyme, structural changes occurring on binding of substrate, metal and product were investigated using crystal structures of ADPRase from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8. Seven structures were determined, including that of the free enzyme, the Zn(2+)-bound enzyme, the binary complex with ADP-ribose, the ternary complexes with ADP-ribose and Zn(2+) or Gd(3+), and the product complexes with AMP and Mg(2+) or with ribose 5'-phosphate and Zn(2+). The structural and functional studies suggested that the ADP-ribose hydrolysis pathway consists of four reaction states: bound with metal (I), metal and substrate (II), metal and substrate in the transition state (III), and products (IV). In reaction state II, Glu-82 and Glu-70 abstract a proton from a water molecule. This water molecule is situated at an ideal position to carry out nucleophilic attack on the adenosyl phosphate, as it is 3.6 A away from the target phosphorus and almost in line with the scissile bond.</p>

<p>4-Diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (IspE) catalyses the ATP-dependent conversion of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDPME) to 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2-phosphate with the release of ADP. This reaction occurs in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis and because it is essential in important microbial pathogens and absent from mammals it represents a potential target for anti-infective drugs. We set out to characterize the biochemical properties, determinants of molecular recognition and reactivity of IspE and report the cloning and purification of recombinant Aquifex aeolicus IspE (AaIspE), kinetic data, metal ion, temperature and pH dependence, crystallization and structure determination of the enzyme in complex with CDP, CDPME and ADP. In addition, 4-fluoro-3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylpent-1-enylphosphonic acid (compound 1) was designed to mimic a fragment of the substrate, a synthetic route to 1 was elucidated and the complex structure determined. Surprisingly, this ligand occupies the binding site for the ATP alpha-phosphate not the binding site for the methyl-D-erythritol moiety of CDPME. Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation indicate that AaIspE is a monomer in solution. The enzyme displays the characteristic alpha/beta galacto-homoserine-mevalonate-phosphomevalonate kinase fold, with the catalytic centre positioned in a deep cleft between the ATP- and CDPME-binding domains. Comparisons indicate a high degree of sequence conservation on the IspE active site across bacterial species, similarities in structure, specificity of substrate recognition and mechanism. The biochemical characterization, attainment of well-ordered and reproducible crystals and the models resulting from the analyses provide reagents and templates to support the structure-based design of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.</p>

<p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), currently infects one-third of the world's population in its latent form. The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensive drug-resistant strains has highlighted the need for new pharmacological targets within M. tuberculosis. The class IIa fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) enzyme from M. tuberculosis (MtFBA) has been proposed as one such target since it is upregulated in latent TB. Since the structure of MtFBA has not been determined and there is little information available on its reaction mechanism, we sought to determine the X-ray structure of MtFBA in complex with its substrates. By lowering the pH of the enzyme in the crystalline state, we were able to determine a series of high-resolution X-ray structures of MtFBA bound to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate at 1.5, 2.1, and 1.3 A, respectively. Through these structures, it was discovered that MtFBA belongs to a novel tetrameric class of type IIa FBAs. The molecular details at the interface of the tetramer revealed important information for better predictability of the quaternary structures among the FBAs based on their primary sequences. These X-ray structures also provide interesting and new details on the reaction mechanism of class II FBAs. Substrates and products were observed in geometries poised for catalysis; in addition, unexpectedly, the hydroxyl-enolate intermediate of dihydroxyacetone phosphate was also captured and resolved structurally. These concise new details offer a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms for FBAs in general and provide a structural basis for inhibitor design efforts aimed at this class of enzymes.</p>

<p>Synthetic cavitands and protein cavities have been widely studied as models for ligand recognition. Here we investigate the Met102 → His substitution in the artificial L99A cavity in T4 lysozyme as a Kemp eliminase. The resulting enzyme had k(cat)/K(M) = 0.43 M(-1) s(-1) and a (k(cat)/K(M))/k(uncat) = 10(7) at pH 5.0. The crystal structure of this enzyme was determined at 1.30 Å, as were the structures of four complexes of substrate and product analogs. The absence of ordered waters or hydrogen bonding interactions, and the presence of a common catalytic base (His102) in an otherwise hydrophobic, buried cavity, facilitated detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism and its optimization. Subsequent substitutions increased eliminase activity by an additional four-fold. As activity-enhancing substitutions were engineered into the cavity, protein stability decreased, consistent with the stability-function trade-off hypothesis. This and related model cavities may provide templates for studying protein design principles in radically simplified environments.</p>

<p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), currently infects one-third of the world's population in its latent form. The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensive drug-resistant strains has highlighted the need for new pharmacological targets within M. tuberculosis. The class IIa fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) enzyme from M. tuberculosis (MtFBA) has been proposed as one such target since it is upregulated in latent TB. Since the structure of MtFBA has not been determined and there is little information available on its reaction mechanism, we sought to determine the X-ray structure of MtFBA in complex with its substrates. By lowering the pH of the enzyme in the crystalline state, we were able to determine a series of high-resolution X-ray structures of MtFBA bound to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate at 1.5, 2.1, and 1.3 A, respectively.

<p>Crystals of the catalytic chain of Methanococcus jannaschii aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) grew in the presence of the regulatory chain in the hexagonal space group P6(3)22, with one monomer per asymmetric unit. This is the first time that crystals with only one monomer in the asymmetric unit have been obtained; all known structures of the catalytic subunit contain several crystallographically independent monomers. The symmetry-related chains form the staggered dimer of trimers observed in the other known structures of the catalytic subunit. The central channel of the catalytic subunit contains a sulfate ion and a K(+) ion as well as a glycerol molecule at its entrance. It is possible that it is involved in channeling carbamoyl phosphate (CP) to the active site of the enzyme. A second sulfate ion near Arg164 is near the second CP position in the wild-type Escherichia coli ATCase structure complexed with CP. It is suggested that this position may also be in the path that CP takes when binding to the active site in a partial diffusion process at 310 K. Additional biochemical studies of carbamoylation and the molecular organization of this enzyme in M. jannaschii will provide further insight into these points.</p>

<p>The development of HIV-1 protease inhibitors has been the historic paradigm of rational structure-based drug design, where structural and thermodynamic analyses have assisted in the discovery of novel inhibitors. While the total enthalpy and entropy change upon binding determine the affinity, often the thermodynamics are considered in terms of inhibitor properties only. In the current study, profound changes are observed in the binding thermodynamics of a drug-resistant variant compared to wild-type HIV-1 protease, irrespective of the inhibitor bound. This variant (Flap+) has a combination of flap and active site mutations and exhibits extremely large entropy-enthalpy compensation compared to wild-type protease, 5-15 kcal/mol, while losing only 1-3 kcal/mol in total binding free energy for any of six FDA-approved inhibitors. Although entropy-enthalpy compensation has been previously observed for a variety of systems, never have changes of this magnitude been reported. The co-crystal structures of Flap+ protease with four of the inhibitors were determined and compared with complexes of both the wild-type protease and another drug-resistant variant that does not exhibit this energetic compensation. Structural changes conserved across the Flap+ complexes, which are more pronounced for the flaps covering the active site, likely contribute to the thermodynamic compensation. The finding that drug-resistant mutations can profoundly modulate the relative thermodynamic properties of a therapeutic target independent of the inhibitor presents a new challenge for rational drug design.</p>

<p>Hyaluronate lyases are a class of endoglycosaminidase enzymes with a high level of complexity and heterogeneity. The main function of the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage protein hyaluronate lyase, HylP2, is to degrade hyaluronan into unsaturated disaccharide units. HylP2 was cloned, over-expressed and purified to homogeneity. The recombinant HylP2 exists as a homotrimer with a molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa under physiological conditions. The HylP2 was crystallized and the crystals were soaked in two separate reservoir solutions containing ascorbic acid and lactose, respectively. The crystal structures of native HylP2 and its two complexes with ascorbic acid and lactose have been determined. HylP2 folds into four distinct domains with a central core consisting of 16 antiparallel beta-strands forming an irregular triangular tube designated as triple-stranded beta-helix. The structures of complexes show that three molecules each of ascorbic acid and lactose bind to protein at the sugar binding groove in the triple-stranded beta-helix domain. Both ascorbic acid and lactose molecules occupy almost identical subsites in the long saccharide binding groove. Both ligands are involved in several hydrogen bonded interactions at each subsite. The binding characteristics and stereochemical properties indicate that Tyr264 may be involved in the catalytic activity of HylP2. The mutation of Tyr264 to Phe264 supports this observation.</p>

<p>We previously reported octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine derivative 2 (T-3256336) as a potent antagonist for inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins. Because compound 2 was susceptible to MDR1 mediated efflux, we developed another scaffold, hexahydropyrazino[1,2-a]indole, using structure-based drug design. The fused benzene ring of this scaffold was aimed at increasing the lipophilicity and decreasing the basicity of the scaffold to improve the membrane permeability across MDR1 expressing cells. We established a chiral pool synthetic route to yield the desired tricyclic chiral isomers. Chemical modification of the core scaffold led to a representative compound 50, which showed strong inhibition of IAP binding (X chromosome-linked IAP [XIAP]: IC50 23 nM and cellular IAP [cIAP]: IC50 1.1 nM) and cell growth inhibition (MDA-MB-231 cells: GI50 2.8 nM) with high permeability and low potential of MDR1 substrate.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of ABT-378 (lopinavir), bound to the active site of HIV-1 protease is described. A comparison with crystal structures of ritonavir, A-78791, and BILA-2450 shows some analogous features with previous reported compounds. A cyclic urea unit in the P(2) position of ABT-378 is novel and makes two bidentate hydrogen bonds with Asp 29 of HIV-1 protease. In addition, a previously unreported shift in the Gly 48 carbonyl position is observed. A discussion of the structural features responsible for its high potency against wild-type HIV protease is given along with an analysis of the effect of active site mutations on potency in in vitro assays.</p>

<p>Abstract Human mitochondrial 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase (mdN) catalyzes dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates, and thus helps maintain homeostasis of deoxynucleosides required for mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Mature mdN is a 23-kDa dimeric protein with highest expression levels in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle. We have identified an alternative splice variant of the mdN gene containing an 18-nucleotide insertion encoding 6 amino acids (GKWPAT) at the 3'-end of the penultimate exon 4. We recombinantly expressed this enzyme variant and characterized its biochemical and kinetic properties as well as its three-dimensional structure. Our high-resolution (1.27 Å) crystal structure revealed that the insertion forms a loop located in the vicinity of the active site pocket and affects enzyme kinetic parameters as well as protein thermal stability.</p>

<p>Mips (macrophage infectivity potentiators) are a subset of immunophilins associated with virulence in a range of micro-organisms. These proteins possess peptidylprolyl isomerase activity and are inhibited by drugs including rapamycin and tacrolimus. We determined the structure of the Mip homologue [BpML1 (Burkholderia pseudomallei Mip-like protein 1)] from the human pathogen and biowarfare threat B. pseudomallei by NMR and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure suggests that key catalytic residues in the BpML1 active site have unexpected conformational flexibility consistent with a role in catalysis. The structure further revealed BpML1 binding to a helical peptide, in a manner resembling the physiological interaction of human TGFβRI (transforming growth factor β receptor I) with the human immunophilin FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein 12). Furthermore, the structure of BpML1 bound to the class inhibitor cycloheximide N-ethylethanoate showed that this inhibitor mimics such a helical peptide, in contrast with the extended prolyl-peptide mimicking shown by inhibitors such as tacrolimus. We suggest that Mips, and potentially other bacterial immunophilins, participate in protein-protein interactions in addition to their peptidylprolyl isomerase activity, and that some roles of Mip proteins in virulence are independent of their peptidylprolyl isomerase activity.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the complete 12 subunit RNA polymerase (pol) II bound to a transcription bubble and product RNA reveals incoming template and nontemplate DNA, a seven base pair DNA/RNA hybrid, and three nucleotides each of separating DNA and RNA. The complex adopts the posttranslocation state and accommodates a cocrystallized nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate. The NTP binds in the active site pore at a position to interact with a DNA template base. Residues surrounding the NTP are conserved in all cellular RNA polymerases, suggesting a universal mechanism of NTP selection and incorporation. DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA strand separation may be explained by pol II-induced duplex distortions. Four protein loops partition the active center cleft, contribute to embedding the hybrid, prevent strand reassociation, and create an RNA exit tunnel. Binding of the elongation factor TFIIS realigns RNA in the active center, possibly converting the elongation complex to an alternative state less prone to stalling.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) heterodimer from Naja naja sagittifera reveals the presence of a new PLA2-like protein with eight disulphide bridges. The heterodimer is formed between a commonly observed group I PLA2 having seven characteristic disulfide bonds and a novel PLA2-like protein (Cys-PLA2) containing two extra cysteines at two highly conserved sites (positions 32 and 49) of structural and functional importance. The crystals of the heterodimer belong to tetragonal space group P41212 with cell dimensions, a = b = 77.7 A and c = 68.4 A corresponding to a solvent content of 33%, which is one of the lowest values observed so far in the PLA2 crystals. The structure has been solved with molecular replacement method and refined to a final R value of 21.6% [Rfree = 25.6%]. The electron density revealed the presence of cysteines 32 and 49 that are covalently linked to give rise to an eighth disulphide bridge in the PLA2-like monomer. A non-protein high-quality electron density was also observed at the substrate-binding site in the PLA2-like protein that has been interpreted as N-acetylglucosamine. The overall tertiary folds of the two monomers are similar having all features of PLA2-type folding. A zinc ion is detected at the interface of the heterodimer with fivefold coordination while another zinc ion was found on the surface of Cys-PLA2 with sixfold coordination. The conformations of the calcium-binding loops of both monomers are significantly different from each other as well as from those in other group I PLA2s. The N-acetylglucosamine molecule is favorably placed in the substrate-binding site of Cys-PLA2 and forms five hydrogen bonds and several van der Waals interactions with protein atoms, thus indicating a strong affinity. It also provides clue of the possible mechanism of sugar recognition by PLA2 and PLA2-like proteins. The formation of heterodimer seems to have been induced by zinc ion.</p>

<p>The genome of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 reveals the presence of a rich repertoire of esterases and lipases highlighting their important role in cellular metabolism. Among them is the carboxylesterase LpEst1 a bacterial enzyme related to the mammalian hormone-sensitive lipase, which is known to play a central role in energy homeostasis. In this study, the crystal structure of LpEst1 has been determined at 2.05 Å resolution; it exhibits an αβ-hydrolase fold, consisting of a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, endowed with novel topological features. The structure reveals a dimeric assembly not comparable with any other enzyme from the bacterial hormone-sensitive lipase family, probably echoing the specific structural features of the participating subunits. Biophysical studies including analytical gel filtration and ultracentrifugation support the dimeric nature of LpEst1. Structural and mutational analyses of the substrate-binding pocket and active site together with biochemical studies provided insights for understanding the substrate profile of LpEst1 and suggested for the first time the conserved Asp173, which is adjacent to the nucleophile, as a key element in the stabilization of the loop where the oxyanion hole resides. </p>

<p>The genetic alphabet is composed of two base pairs, and the development of a third, unnatural base pair would increase the genetic and chemical potential of DNA. d5SICS-dNaM is one of the most efficiently replicated unnatural base pairs identified to date, but its pairing is mediated by only hydrophobic and packing forces, and in free duplex DNA it forms a cross-strand intercalated structure that makes its efficient replication difficult to understand. Recent studies of the KlenTaq DNA polymerase revealed that the insertion of d5SICSTP opposite dNaM proceeds via a mutually induced-fit mechanism, where the presence of the triphosphate induces the polymerase to form the catalytically competent closed structure, which in turn induces the pairing nucleotides of the developing unnatural base pair to adopt a planar Watson-Crick-like structure. To understand the remaining steps of replication, we now report the characterization of the prechemistry complexes corresponding to the insertion of dNaMTP opposite d5SICS, as well as multiple postchemistry complexes in which the already formed unnatural base pair is positioned at the postinsertion site. Unlike with the insertion of d5SICSTP opposite dNaM, addition of dNaMTP does not fully induce the formation of the catalytically competent closed state. The data also reveal that once synthesized and translocated to the postinsertion position, the unnatural nucleobases again intercalate. Two modes of intercalation are observed, depending on the nature of the flanking nucleotides, and are each stabilized by different interactions with the polymerase, and each appear to reduce the affinity with which the next correct triphosphate binds. Thus, continued primer extension is limited by deintercalation and rearrangements with the polymerase active site that are required to populate the catalytically active, triphosphate bound conformation. </p>

<p>We present crystal structures of the calcium-free E2 state of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, stabilized by the inhibitor thapsigargin and the ATP analog AMPPCP. The structures allow us to describe the ATP binding site in a modulatory mode uncoupled from the Asp351 phosphorylation site. The Glu439 side chain interacts with AMPPCP via an Mg2+ ion in accordance with previous Fe2+ -cleavage studies implicating this residue in the ATPase cycle and in magnesium binding. Functional data on Ca2+ mediated activation indicate that the crystallized state represents an initial stage of ATP modulated deprotonation of E2, preceding the binding of Ca2+ ions in the membrane from the cytoplasmic side. We propose a mechanism of Ca2+ activation of phosphorylation leading directly from the compact E2-ATP form to the Ca2E1-ATP state. In addition, a role of Glu439 in ATP modulation of other steps of the functional cycle is suggested.</p>

<p>2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF) catalyzes the conversion of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2-phosphate to 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate and cytidine monophosphate in production of isoprenoid-precursors via the methylerythritol phosphate biosynthetic pathway. IspF is found in the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite that causes cerebral malaria, as well as in many Gram-negative bacteria such as Burkholderia cenocepacia. IspF represents a potential target for development of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs since it is proven or inferred as essential in these pathogens and absent from mammals. Structural studies of IspF from these two important yet distinct pathogens, and comparisons with orthologues have been carried out to generate reagents, to support and inform a structure-based approach to early stage drug discovery.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the binuclear metallophosphotriesterases (PTEs, E.C. 3.1.8.1) catalyse substrate hydrolysis has been extensively studied. The mu-hydroxo bridge between the metal ions has been proposed to be the initiating nucleophile in the hydrolytic reaction. In contrast, analysis of some biomimetic systems has indicated that mu-hydroxo bridges are often not themselves nucleophiles, but act as general bases for freely exchangeable nucleophilic water molecules. Herein, we present crystallographic analyses of a bacterial PTE from Agrobacterium radiobacter, OpdA, capturing the enzyme-substrate complex during hydrolysis. This model of the Michaelis complex suggests the alignment of the substrate will favour attack from a solvent molecule terminally coordinated to the alpha-metal ion. The bridging of both metal ions by the product, without disruption of the mu-hydroxo bridge, is also consistent with nucleophilic attack occurring from the terminal position. When phosphodiesters are soaked into crystals of OpdA, they coordinate bidentately to the beta-metal ion, displacing the mu-hydroxo bridge. Thus, alternative product-binding modes exist for the PTEs, and it is the bridging mode that appears to result from phosphotriester hydrolysis. Kinetic analysis of the PTE and promiscuous phosphodiesterase activities confirms that the presence of a mu-hydroxo bridge during phosphotriester hydrolysis is correlated with a lower pK(a) for the nucleophile, consistent with a general base function during catalysis.</p>

<p>Lipoyl-lysine swinging arms are crucial to the reactions catalysed by the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes. A gene encoding a putative lipoate protein ligase (LplA) of Thermoplasma acidophilum was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein, a monomer of molecular mass 29 kDa, was catalytically inactive. Crystal structures in the absence and presence of bound lipoic acid were solved at 2.1 A resolution. The protein was found to fall into the alpha/beta class and to be structurally homologous to the catalytic domains of class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthases and biotin protein ligase, BirA. Lipoic acid in LplA was bound in the same position as biotin in BirA. The structure of the T.acidophilum LplA and limited proteolysis of E.coli LplA together highlighted some key features of the post-translational modification. A loop comprising residues 71-79 in the T.acidophilum ligase is proposed as interacting with the dithiolane ring of lipoic acid and discriminating against the entry of biotin. A second loop comprising residues 179-193 was disordered in the T.acidophilum structure; tryptic cleavage of the corresponding loop in the E.coli LplA under non-denaturing conditions rendered the enzyme catalytically inactive, emphasizing its importance. The putative LplA of T.acidophilum lacks a C-terminal domain found in its counterparts in E.coli (Gram-negative) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (Gram-positive). A gene encoding a protein that appears to have structural homology to the additional domain in the E.coli and S.pneumoniae enzymes was detected alongside the structural gene encoding the putative LplA in the T.acidophilum genome. It is likely that this protein is required to confer activity on the LplA as currently purified, one protein perhaps catalysing the formation of the obligatory lipoyl-AMP intermediate, and the other transferring the lipoyl group from it to the specific lysine residue in the target protein.</p>

<p>Prostaglandin H2 synthase (EC 1.14.99.1) is a clinically important drug target that catalyzes two key steps in the biosynthesis of the eicosanoid hormones. The enzyme contains spatially distinct cyclooxygenase and peroxidase active sites, both of which require a heme cofactor. Substitution of ferric heme by Mn(III) protoporphyrin IX greatly diminishes the peroxidase activity, but has little effect on the cyclooxygenase activity. Here, the 2.0 angstroms resolution crystal structure of the Mn(III) form of ovine prostaglandin H2 synthase-1 is described (R = 21.8%, R(free) = 23.7%). Substitution of Mn(III) for Fe(III) causes no structural perturbations in the protein. However, the out-of-plane displacement of the manganese ion with respect to the porphyrin is greater than that of the iron by approximately 0.2 angstroms. This perturbation may help to explain the altered catalytic properties of the manganese enzyme.</p>

<p>Membrane-bound respiratory [NiFe]-hydrogenase (MBH), a H(2)-uptake enzyme found in the periplasmic space of bacteria, catalyses the oxidation of dihydrogen: H(2) → 2H(+) + 2e(-) (ref. 1). In contrast to the well-studied O(2)-sensitive [NiFe]-hydrogenases (referred to as the standard enzymes), MBH has an O(2)-tolerant H(2) oxidation activity; however, the mechanism of O(2) tolerance is unclear. Here we report the crystal structures of Hydrogenovibrio marinus MBH in three different redox conditions at resolutions between 1.18 and 1.32 Å. We find that the proximal iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster of MBH has a [4Fe-3S] structure coordinated by six cysteine residues--in contrast to the [4Fe-4S] cubane structure coordinated by four cysteine residues found in the proximal Fe-S cluster of the standard enzymes--and that an amide nitrogen of the polypeptide backbone is deprotonated and additionally coordinates the cluster when chemically oxidized, thus stabilizing the superoxidized state of the cluster. The structure of MBH is very similar to that of the O(2)-sensitive standard enzymes except for the proximal Fe-S cluster. Our results give a reasonable explanation why the O(2) tolerance of MBH is attributable to the unique proximal Fe-S cluster; we propose that the cluster is not only a component of the electron transfer for the catalytic cycle, but that it also donates two electrons and one proton crucial for the appropriate reduction of O(2) in preventing the formation of an unready, inactive state of the enzyme.</p>

<p>Glucansucrase enzymes synthesize high-molecular-mass extracellular α-glucan polysaccharides from sucrose. Previously, the crystal structure of truncated glucansucrase glucosyltransferase (GTF)180-ΔN from Lactobacillus reuteri 180 (lacking the N-terminal domain) revealed an elongated overall structure with two remote domains (IV and V) extending away from the core. By contrast, a new crystal form of the α-1,6/α-1,3 specific glucansucrase GTF180-ΔN shows an approximate 120<sup>o</sup> rotation of domain V about a hinge located between domains IV and V, giving a much more compact structure than before. Positional variability of domain V in solution is confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering experiments and rigid-body ensemble calculations. In addition, small angle X-ray scattering measurements of full-length GTF180 also provide the first structural data for a full-length glucansucrase, showing that the enzyme has an almost symmetric boomerang-like molecular shape, with a bend likely located between domains IV and V. The ~ 700-residue N-terminal domain, which is not present in the crystal structures, extends away from domain V and the catalytic core of the enzyme. We conclude that, as a result of the hinge region, in solution, GTF180-ΔN (and likely also the full-length GTF180) shows conformational flexibility; this may be a general feature of GH70 glucansucrases.</p>

<p>Pupylation is a posttranslational protein modification occurring in mycobacteria and other actinobacteria that is functionally analogous to ubiquitination. Here we report the crystal structures of the modification enzymes involved in this pathway, the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) ligase PafA and the depupylase/deamidase Dop. Both feature a larger amino-terminal domain consisting of a central β-sheet packed against a cluster of helices, a fold characteristic for carboxylate-amine ligases, and a smaller C-terminal domain unique to PafA/Dop members. The active site is located on the concave surface of the β-sheet with the nucleotide bound in a deep pocket. A conserved groove leading into the active site could have a role in Pup-binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance and biochemical experiments determine the region of Pup that interacts with PafA and Dop. Structural data and mutational studies identify crucial residues for the catalysis of both enzymes.</p>

<p>Brown algal phlorotannins are structural analogs of condensed tannins in terrestrial plants and, like plant phenols, they have numerous biological functions. Despite their importance in brown algae, phlorotannin biosynthetic pathways have been poorly characterized at the molecular level. We found that a predicted type III polyketide synthase in the genome of the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus, PKS1, catalyzes a major step in the biosynthetic pathway of phlorotannins (i.e., the synthesis of phloroglucinol monomers from malonyl-CoA). The crystal structure of PKS1 at 2.85-Å resolution provided a good quality electron density map showing a modified Cys residue, likely connected to a long chain acyl group. An additional pocket not found in other known type III PKSs contains a reaction product that might correspond to a phloroglucinol precursor. In vivo, we also found a positive correlation between the phloroglucinol content and the PKS III gene expression level in cells of a strain of Ectocarpus adapted to freshwater during its reacclimation to seawater. The evolution of the type III PKS gene family in Stramenopiles suggests a lateral gene transfer event from an actinobacterium. </p>

<p>Homotrimeric dUTPases contain three active sites, each formed by five conserved sequence motifs originating from all three subunits. The essential fifth motif lies in a flexible C-terminal arm which becomes ordered during catalysis and is disordered in most crystal structures. Previously, it has been shown that the two Bacillus subtilis dUTPases, YncF and YosS, differ from their orthologues in the position in the sequence of the essential Phe-lid residue, which stacks against the uracil base, and in the conformation of the general base aspartate, which points away from the active site. Here, three structures of the complex of YncF with dU-PPi-Mg(2+) and the structure of YosS complexed with dUMP are reported. dU-PPi-Mg(2+) triggers the ordering of both the C-terminal arm and a loop (residues 18-26) which is uniquely disordered in the Bacillus dUTPases. The dUMP complex suggests two stages in substrate release. Limited proteolysis experiments allowed those complexes in which C-terminal cleavage is hindered and those in which it can be assumed to be ordered to be identified. The results lead to the suggestion that dUpNHpp is not a perfect substrate mimic, at least for the B. subtilis enzymes, and provide new insights into the mechanism of these two dUTPases in comparison to their orthologues. The enzyme mechanism is reviewed using the present and previous crystal structures as snapshots along the reaction coordinate. </p>

<p>Proteins of the cradle-loop barrel metafold are formed by duplication of a conserved betaalphabeta-element, suggesting a common evolutionary origin from an ancestral group of nucleic acid-binding proteins. The basal fold within this metafold, the RIFT barrel, is also found in a wide range of enzymes, whose homologous relationship with the nucleic acid-binding group is unclear. We have characterized a protein family that is intermediate in sequence and structure between the basal group of cradle-loop barrels and one family of RIFT-barrel enzymes, the riboflavin kinases. We report the structure, substrate-binding mode, and catalytic activity for one of these proteins, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii Mj0056, which is an archaeal riboflavin kinase. Mj0056 is unusual in utilizing CTP rather than ATP as the donor nucleotide, and sequence conservation in the relevant residues suggests that this is a general feature of archaeal riboflavin kinases.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of triclinic hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) has been refined against diffraction data extending to 0.65 A resolution measured at 100 K using synchrotron radiation. Refinement with anisotropic displacement parameters and with the removal of stereochemical restraints for the well ordered parts of the structure converged with a conventional R factor of 8.39% and an R(free) of 9.52%. The use of full-matrix refinement provided an estimate of the variances in the derived parameters. In addition to the 129-residue protein, a total of 170 water molecules, nine nitrate ions, one acetate ion and three ethylene glycol molecules were located in the electron-density map. Eight sections of the main chain and many side chains were modeled with alternate conformations. The occupancies of the water sites were refined and this step is meaningful when assessed by use of the free R factor. A detailed description and comparison of the structure are made with reference to the previously reported triclinic HEWL structures refined at 0.925 A (at the low temperature of 120 K) and at 0.95 A resolution (at room temperature).</p>

<p>Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) is a nonheme iron oxidase that catalyzes the central step in the biosynthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics: oxidative cyclization of the linear tripeptide delta-L-alpha-aminoadipoyl-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) to isopenicillin N (IPN). The ACV analogue delta-L-alpha-aminoadipoyl-L-cysteine (1-(S)-carboxy-2-thiomethyl)ethyl ester (ACOmC) has been synthesized as a mechanistic probe of IPNS catalysis and crystallized with the enzyme. The crystal structure of the anaerobic IPNS/Fe(II)/ACOmC complex was determined to 1.80 A resolution, revealing a highly congested active site region. By exposing these anaerobically grown crystals to high-pressure oxygen gas, an unexpected sulfenate product has been observed, complexed to iron within the IPNS active site. A mechanism is proposed for formation of the sulfenate-iron complex, and it appears that ACOmC follows a different reaction pathway at the earliest stages of its reaction with IPNS. Thus it seems that oxygen (the cosubstrate) binds in a different site to that observed in previous studies with IPNS, displacing a water ligand from iron in the process. The iron-mediated conversion of metal-bound thiolate to sulfenate has not previously been observed in crystallographic studies with IPNS. This mode of reactivity is of particular interest when considered in the context of another family of nonheme iron enzymes, the nitrile hydratases, in which post-translational oxidation of two cysteine thiolates to sulfenic and sulfinic acids is essential for enzyme activity.</p>

<p>A series of arylsulfonamides has been synthesized and investigated for the inhibition of some selected human carbonic anhydrase isoforms. The studied compounds showed significant inhibitory effects in the nanomolar range toward druggable isoforms (hCA VII, hCA IX, and hCA XIV) (K(i) values from 4.8 to 61.7 nM), whereas they generally exhibited significant selectivity over hCA I and hCA II, that are ubiquitous and considered off-target isoforms. On the basis of biochemical data, we herein discussed structure-affinity relationships for this series of arylsulfonamides, suggesting a key role for alkoxy substituents in CA inhibition. Furthermore, X-ray crystal structures of complexes of two active inhibitors (I and 2a) with hCA II allowed us to elucidate the main interactions between the inhibitor and specific amino acid residues within the catalytic site.</p>

<p>Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) from Thermus aquaticus was characterized biochemically via measurements of the activity of the enzyme and determination of its quaternary structure as well as its stability and refolding properties. The enzyme is most active between pH 8.0 and 8.4 and its activity increases with temperature to about 339 K. Gel-filtration chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium under native conditions demonstrated that the enzyme is a heterotetramer of two α-subunits and two β-subunits. The activity assays showed that the enzyme uses either ADP/ATP or GDP/GTP, but prefers GDP/GTP. This contrasts with Escherichia coli SCS, which uses GDP/GTP but prefers ADP/ATP. To understand the nucleotide preference, T. aquaticus SCS was crystallized in the presence of GDP, leading to the determination of the structure in complex with GDP-Mn(2+). A water molecule and Pro20β in T. aquaticus take the place of Gln20β in pig GTP-specific SCS, interacting well with the guanine base and other residues of the nucleotide-binding site. This leads to the preference for GDP/GTP, but does not hinder the binding of ADP/ATP.</p>

<p>The reduction of pathophysiologic levels of nitric oxide through inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) has the potential to be therapeutically beneficial in various neurodegenerative diseases. We have developed a series of pyrrolidine-based nNOS inhibitors that exhibit excellent potencies and isoform selectivities (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 5437). However, there are still important challenges, such as how to decrease the multiple positive charges derived from basic amino groups, which contribute to poor bioavailability, without losing potency and/or selectivity. Here we present an interdisciplinary study combining molecular docking, crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, synthesis, and enzymology to explore potential pharmacophoric features of nNOS inhibitors and to design potent and selective monocationic nNOS inhibitors. The simulation results indicate that different hydrogen bond patterns, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and a water molecule bridge are key factors for stabilizing ligands and controlling ligand orientation. We find that a heteroatom in the aromatic head or linker chain of the ligand provides additional stability and blocks the substrate binding pocket. Finally, the computational insights are experimentally validated with double-headed pyridine analogues. The compounds reported here are among the most potent and selective monocationic pyrrolidine-based nNOS inhibitors reported to date, and 10 shows improved membrane permeability.</p>

<p>Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a variety of human infections, including life-threatening, systemic conditions. Secreted proteome, including a range of proteases, constitutes the major virulence factor of the bacterium. However, the functions of individual enzymes, in particular SplA protease, remain poorly characterized. Here, we report development of specific inhibitors of SplA protease. The design, synthesis, and activity of a series of α-aminoalkylphosphonate diaryl esters and their peptidyl derivatives are described. Potent inhibitors of SplA are reported, which may facilitate future investigation of physiological function of the protease. The binding modes of the high-affinity compounds Cbz-Phe(P) -(OC6 H4 -4-SO2 CH3 )2 and Suc-Val-Pro-Phe(P) -(OC6 H5 )2 are revealed by high-resolution crystal structures of complexes with the protease. Surprisingly, the binding mode of both compounds deviates from previously characterized canonical interaction of α-aminoalkylphosphonate peptidyl derivatives and family S1 serine proteases. </p>

<p>DNA base excision repair is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and for active DNA demethylation, a central element of epigenetic regulation. A key player is thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), which excises thymine from mutagenic G·T mispairs that arise by deamination of 5-methylcytosine (mC). TDG also removes 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine, oxidized forms of mC produced by Tet enzymes. Recent studies show that the glycosylase activity of TDG is essential for active DNA demethylation and for embryonic development. Our understanding of how repair enzymes excise modified bases without acting on undamaged DNA remains incomplete, particularly for mismatch glycosylases such as TDG. We solved a crystal structure of TDG (catalytic domain) bound to a substrate analog and characterized active-site residues by mutagenesis, kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. The studies reveal how TDG binds and positions the nucleophile (water) and uncover a previously unrecognized catalytic residue (Thr197). Remarkably, mutation of two active-site residues (Ala145 and His151) causes a dramatic enhancement in G·T glycosylase activity but confers even greater increases in the aberrant removal of thymine from normal A·T base pairs. The strict conservation of these residues may reflect a mechanism used to strike a tolerable balance between the requirement for efficient repair of G·T lesions and the need to minimize aberrant action on undamaged DNA, which can be mutagenic and cytotoxic. Such a compromise in G·T activity can account in part for the relatively weak G·T activity of TDG, a trait that could potentially contribute to the hypermutability of CpG sites in cancer and genetic disease.</p>

<p>SsoPox is a lactonase endowed with promiscuous phosphotriesterase activity isolated from Sulfolobus solfataricus that belongs to the Phosphotriesterase-Like Lactonase family. Because of its intrinsic thermal stability, SsoPox is seen as an appealing candidate as a bioscavenger for organophosphorus compounds. A comprehensive kinetic characterisation of SsoPox has been performed with various phosphotriesters (insecticides) and phosphodiesters (nerve agent analogues) as substrates. We show that SsoPox is active for a broad range of OPs and remains active under denaturing conditions. In addition, its OP hydrolase activity is highly stimulated by anionic detergent at ambient temperature and exhibits catalytic efficiencies as high as k(cat)/K(M) of 10(5) M(-1)s(-1) against a nerve agent analogue. The structure of SsoPox bound to the phosphotriester fensulfothion reveals an unexpected and non-productive binding mode. This feature suggests that SsoPox's active site is sub-optimal for phosphotriester binding, which depends not only upon shape but also on localised charge of the ligand.</p>

<p>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of the structural basis of glycosyl transfer. Yet the nature and relevance of the conformational changes associated with substrate recognition and catalysis remain poorly understood. We have focused on the glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (GpgS), a "retaining" enzyme, that initiates the biosynthetic pathway of methylglucose lipopolysaccharides in mycobacteria. Evidence is provided that GpgS displays an unusually broad metal ion specificity for a GT-A enzyme, with Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Ca(2+), Co(2+), and Fe(2+) assisting catalysis. In the crystal structure of the apo-form of GpgS, we have observed that a flexible loop adopts a double conformation L(A) and L(I) in the active site of both monomers of the protein dimer. Notably, the L(A) loop geometry corresponds to an active conformation and is conserved in two other relevant states of the enzyme, namely the GpgS·metal·nucleotide sugar donor and the GpgS·metal·nucleotide·acceptor-bound complexes, indicating that GpgS is intrinsically in a catalytically active conformation. The crystal structure of GpgS in the presence of Mn(2+)·UDP·phosphoglyceric acid revealed an alternate conformation for the nucleotide sugar β-phosphate, which likely occurs upon sugar transfer. Structural, biochemical, and biophysical data point to a crucial role of the β-phosphate in donor and acceptor substrate binding and catalysis. Altogether, our experimental data suggest a model wherein the catalytic site is essentially preformed, with a few conformational changes of lateral chain residues as the protein proceeds along the catalytic cycle. This model of action may be applicable to a broad range of GT-A glycosyltransferases.</p>

<p>Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) is a tetrameric enzyme that is the first enzyme unique to the ( S)-lysine biosynthetic pathway in plants and bacteria. Previous studies have looked at the important role of Tyr107, an amino acid residue located at the tight-dimer interface between two monomers, in participating in a catalytic triad of residues during catalysis. In this study, we examine the importance of this residue in determining the quaternary structure of the DHDPS enzyme. The Tyr107 residue was mutated to tryptophan, and structural, biophysical, and kinetic studies were carried out on the mutant enzyme. These revealed that while the solid-state structure of the mutant enzyme was largely unchanged, as judged by X-ray crystallography, it exists as a mixture of primarily monomer and tetramer in solution, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography, and mass spectrometry. The catalytic ability of the DHDPS enzyme was reduced by the mutation, which also allowed the adventitious binding of alpha-ketoglutarate to the active site. A reduction in the apparent melting temperature of the mutant enzyme was observed. Thus, the tetrameric quaternary structure of DHDPS is critical to controlling specificity, heat stability, and intrinsic activity.</p>

<p>Using a new expression construct, rhamnose isomerase from Escherichia coli was purified and crystallized. The crystal structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined to a crystallographic residual of 17.4 % at 1.6 A resolution. Rhamnose isomerase is a tight tetramer of four (beta/alpha)(8)-barrels. A comparison with other known structures reveals that rhamnose isomerase is most similar to xylose isomerase. Alignment of the sequences of the two enzymes based on their structures reveals a hitherto undetected sequence identity of 13 %, suggesting that the two enzymes evolved from a common precursor. The structure and arrangement of the (beta/alpha)(8)-barrels of rhamnose isomerase are very similar to xylose isomerase. Each enzyme does, however, have additional alpha-helical domains, which are involved in tetramer association, and largely differ in structure. The structures of complexes of rhamnose isomerase with the inhibitor l-rhamnitol and the natural substrate l-rhamnose were determined and suggest that an extended loop, which is disordered in the native enzyme, becomes ordered on substrate binding, and may exclude bulk solvent during catalysis. Unlike xylose isomerase, this loop does not extend across a subunit interface but contributes to the active site of its own subunit. It illustrates how an interconversion between inter and intra-subunit complementation can occur during evolution. In the crystal structure (although not necessarily in vivo) rhamnose isomerase appears to bind Zn(2+) at a "structural" site. In the presence of substrate the enzyme also binds Mn(2+) at a nearby "catalytic" site. An array of hydrophobic residues, not present in xylose isomerase, is likely to be responsible for the recognition of l-rhamnose as a substrate. The available structural data suggest that a metal-mediated hydride-shift mechanism, which is generally favored for xylose isomerase, is also feasible for rhamnose isomerase.</p>

<p>Proliferating tumor cells use aerobic glycolysis to support their high metabolic demands. Paradoxically, increased glycolysis is often accompanied by expression of the lower activity PKM2 isoform, effectively constraining lower glycolysis. Here, we report the discovery of PKM2 activators with a unique allosteric binding mode. Characterization of how these compounds impact cancer cells revealed an unanticipated link between glucose and amino acid metabolism. PKM2 activation resulted in a metabolic rewiring of cancer cells manifested by a profound dependency on the nonessential amino acid serine for continued cell proliferation. Induction of serine auxotrophy by PKM2 activation was accompanied by reduced carbon flow into the serine biosynthetic pathway and increased expression of high affinity serine transporters. These data support the hypothesis that PKM2 expression confers metabolic flexibility to cancer cells that allows adaptation to nutrient stress.</p>

<p>In the tryptophan synthase bienzyme complex, indole produced by substrate cleavage at the alpha-site is channeled to the beta-site via a 25 A long tunnel. Within the beta-site, indole and l-Ser react with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in a two-stage reaction to give l-Trp. In stage I, l-Ser forms an external aldimine, E(Aex1), which converts to the alpha-aminoacrylate aldimine, E(A-A). Formation of E(A-A) at the beta-site activates the alpha-site &gt;30-fold. In stage II, indole reacts with E(A-A) to give l-Trp. The binding of alpha-site ligands (ASLs) exerts strong allosteric effects on the reaction of substrates at the beta-site: the distribution of intermediates formed in stage I is shifted in favor of E(A-A), and the binding of ASLs triggers a conformational change in the beta-site to a state with an increased affinity for l-Ser. Here, we compare the behavior of new ASLs as allosteric effectors of stage I with the behavior of the natural product, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Rapid kinetics and kinetic isotope effects show these ASLs bind with affinities ranging from micro- to millimolar, and the rate-determining step for conversion of E(Aex1) to E(A-A) is increased by 8-10-fold. To derive a structure-based mechanism for stage I, X-ray structures of both the E(Aex1) and E(A-A) states complexed with the different ASLs were determined and compared with structures of the ASL complexes with the internal aldimine [Ngo, H., Harris, R., Kimmich, N., Casino, P., Niks, D., Blumenstein, L., Barends, T. R., Kulik, V., Weyand, M., Schlichting, I., and Dunn, M. F. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 7713-7727].</p>

<p>High-throughput crystallography has reached a level of automation where complete computer-assisted robotic crystallization pipelines are capable of cocktail preparation, crystallization plate setup, and inspection and interpretation of results. While mounting of crystal pins, data collection and structure solution are highly automated, crystal harvesting and cryocooling remain formidable challenges towards full automation. To address the final frontier in achieving fully automated high-throughput crystallography, the prototype of an anthropomorphic six-axis universal micromanipulation robot (UMR) has been designed and tested; this UMR is capable of operator-assisted harvesting and cryoquenching of protein crystals as small as 10 microm from a variety of 96-well plates. The UMR is equipped with a versatile tool exchanger providing full operational flexibility. Trypsin crystals harvested and cryoquenched using the UMR have yielded a 1.5 A structure demonstrating the feasibility of robotic protein crystal harvesting.</p>

<p>Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphotransferase (DHEA-ST) is an enzyme that converts dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and some other steroids, into their sulphonated forms. The enzyme catalyses the sulphonation of DHEA on the 3alpha-oxygen, with 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulphate contributing the sulphate. The structure of human DHEA-ST in complex with its preferred substrate DHEA has been solved here to 1.99 A using molecular replacement with oestradiol sulphotransferase (37% sequence identity) as a model. Two alternative substrate-binding orientations have been identified. The primary, catalytic, orientation has the DHEA 3alpha-oxygen and the highly conserved catalytic histidine in nearly identical positions as are seen for the related oestradiol sulphotransferase. The substrate, however, shows rotations of up to 30 degrees, and there is a corresponding rearrangement of the protein loops contributing to the active site. This may also reflect the low identity between the two enzymes. The second orientation penetrates further into the active site and can form a potential hydrogen bond with the desulphonated cofactor 3',5'-phosphoadenosine (PAP). This second site contains more van der Waal interactions with hydrophobic residues than the catalytic site and may also reflect the substrate-inhibition site. The PAP position was obtained from the previously solved structure of DHEA-ST co-crystallized with PAP. This latter structure, due to the arrangement of loops within the active site and monomer interactions, cannot bind substrate. The results presented here describe details of substrate binding to DHEA-ST and the potential relationship to substrate inhibition.</p>

<p>Somatic hypermutation is programmed base substitutions in the variable regions of Ig genes for high-affinity antibody generation. Two motifs, RGYW and WA (R, purine; Y, pyrimidine; W, A or T), have been found to be somatic hypermutation hotspots. Overwhelming evidence suggests that DNA polymerase η (Pol η) is responsible for converting the WA motif to WG by misincorporating dGTP opposite the templating T. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, crystal structures and kinetics of human Pol η substituting dGTP for dATP in four sequence contexts, TA, AA, GA, and CA, have been determined and compared. The T:dGTP wobble base pair is stabilized by Gln-38 and Arg-61, two uniquely conserved residues among Pol η. Weak base paring of the W (T:A or A:T) at the primer end and their distinct interactions with Pol η lead to misincorporation of G in the WA motif. Between two WA motifs, our kinetic and structural data indicate that A-to-G mutation occurs more readily in the TA context than AA. Finally, Pol η can extend the T:G mispair efficiently to complete the mutagenesis.</p>

<p>Enzymes in lipid metabolism acquire and deliver hydrophobic substrates and products from within lipid bilayers. The structure at 2.55 Å of one isozyme of a constitutive enzyme in lipid A biosynthesis, LpxI from Caulobacter crescentus, has a novel fold. Two domains close around a completely sequestered substrate, UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine, and open to release products either to the neighboring enzyme in a putative multienzyme complex or to the bilayer. Mutation analysis identifies Asp225 as key to Mg(2+)-catalyzed diphosphate hydrolysis. These structures provide snapshots of the enzymatic synthesis of a critical lipid A precursor.</p>

<p>In this article we describe the application of structural biology methods to the discovery of novel potent inhibitors of methionine aminopeptidases. These enzymes are employed by the cells to cleave the N-terminal methionine from nascent peptides and proteins. As this is one of the critical steps in protein maturation, it is very likely that inhibitors of these enzymes may prove useful as novel antibacterial agents. Involvement of crystallography at the very early stages of the inhibitor design process resulted in serendipitous discovery of a new inhibitor class, the pyrazole-diamines. Atomic-resolution structures of several inhibitors bound to the enzyme illuminate a new mode of inhibitor binding.</p>

<p>Darunavir is the most recently approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease (PR) inhibitor (PI) and is active against many HIV type 1 PR variants resistant to earlier-generation PIs. Darunavir shows a high genetic barrier to resistance development, and virus strains with lower sensitivity to darunavir have a higher number of PI resistance-associated mutations than viruses resistant to other PIs. In this work, we have enzymologically and structurally characterized a number of highly mutated clinically derived PRs with high levels of phenotypic resistance to darunavir. With 18 to 21 amino acid residue changes, the PR variants studied in this work are the most highly mutated HIV PR species ever studied by means of enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography. The recombinant proteins showed major defects in substrate binding, while the substrate turnover was less affected. Remarkably, the overall catalytic efficiency of the recombinant PRs (5% that of the wild-type enzyme) is still sufficient to support polyprotein processing and particle maturation in the corresponding viruses. The X-ray structures of drug-resistant PRs complexed with darunavir suggest that the impaired inhibitor binding could be explained by change in the PR-inhibitor hydrogen bond pattern in the P2' binding pocket due to a substantial shift of the aminophenyl moiety of the inhibitor. Recombinant virus phenotypic characterization, enzyme kinetics, and X-ray structural analysis thus help to explain darunavir resistance development in HIV-positive patients.</p>

<p>Penicillium chrysogenum Acyl coenzyme A:isopenicillin N acyltransferase (AT) performs the last step in the biosynthesis of hydrophobic penicillins, exchanging the hydrophilic side chain of a precursor for various hydrophobic side chains. Like other N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases AT is produced as an inactive precursor that matures upon posttranslational cleavage. The structure of a Cys103Ala precursor mutant shows that maturation is autoproteolytic, initiated by Cys103 cleaving its preceding peptide bond. The crystal structure of the mature enzyme shows that after autoproteolysis residues 92-102 fold outwards, exposing a buried pocket. This pocket is structurally and chemically flexible and can accommodate substrates of different size and polarity. Modeling of a substrate-bound state indicates the residues important for catalysis. Comparison of the proposed autoproteolytic and substrate hydrolysis mechanisms shows that in both events the same catalytic residues are used, but that they perform different roles in catalysis.</p>

<p>A model binding site was used to investigate charge-charge interactions in molecular docking. This simple site, a small (180A(3)) engineered cavity in cyctochrome c peroxidase (CCP), is negatively charged and completely buried from solvent, allowing us to explore the balance between electrostatic energy and ligand desolvation energy in a system where many of the common approximations in docking do not apply. A database with about 5300 molecules was docked into this cavity. Retrospective testing with known ligands and decoys showed that overall the balance between electrostatic interaction and desolvation energy was captured. More interesting were prospective docking scre"ens that looked for novel ligands, especially those that might reveal problems with the docking and energy methods. Based on screens of the 5300 compound database, both high-scoring and low-scoring molecules were acquired and tested for binding. Out of 16 new, high-scoring compounds tested, 15 were observed to bind. All of these were small heterocyclic cations. Binding constants were measured for a few of these, they ranged between 20microM and 60microM. Crystal structures were determined for ten of these ligands in complex with the protein. The observed ligand geometry corresponded closely to that predicted by docking. Several low-scoring alkyl amino cations were also tested and found to bind. The low docking score of these molecules owed to the relatively high charge density of the charged amino group and the corresponding high desolvation penalty. When the complex structures of those ligands were determined, a bound water molecule was observed interacting with the amino group and a backbone carbonyl group of the cavity. This water molecule mitigates the desolvation penalty and improves the interaction energy relative to that of the "naked" site used in the docking screen. Finally, six low-scoring neutral molecules were also tested, with a view to looking for false negative predictions. Whereas most of these did not bind, two did (phenol and 3-fluorocatechol). Crystal structures for these two ligands in complex with the cavity site suggest reasons for their binding. That these neutral molecules do, in fact bind, contradicts previous results in this site and, along with the alkyl amines, provides instructive false negatives that help identify weaknesses in our scoring functions. Several improvements of these are considered.</p>

<p>Human somatic angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dependent exopeptidase, that catalyses the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to the octapeptide angiotensin II, by removing a C-terminal dipeptide. It is the principal component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood pressure. Hence it is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Here, we report the structures of an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE; a proven structural model for the more complex human ACE) co-crystallized with mammalian peptide substrates (bradykinin, Thr(6) -bradykinin, angiotensin I and a snake venom peptide inhibitor, bradykinin-potentiating peptide-b). The structures determined at 2-Å resolution illustrate that both angiotensin II (the cleaved product of angiotensin I by AnCE) and bradykinin-potentiating peptide-b bind in an analogous fashion at the active site of AnCE, but also exhibit significant differences. In addition, the binding of Arg-Pro-Pro, the cleavage product of bradykinin and Thr(6) - bradykinin, provides additional detail of the general peptide binding in AnCE. Thus the new structures of AnCE complexes presented here improves our understanding of the binding of peptides and the mechanism by which peptides inhibit this family of enzymes.</p>

<p>A model binding site was used to investigate charge-charge interactions in molecular docking. This simple site, a small (180A(3)) engineered cavity in cyctochrome c peroxidase (CCP), is negatively charged and completely buried from solvent, allowing us to explore the balance between electrostatic energy and ligand desolvation energy in a system where many of the common approximations in docking do not apply. A database with about 5300 molecules was docked into this cavity. Retrospective testing with known ligands and decoys showed that overall the balance between electrostatic interaction and desolvation energy was captured. More interesting were prospective docking scre"ens that looked for novel ligands, especially those that might reveal problems with the docking and energy methods. Based on screens of the 5300 compound database, both high-scoring and low-scoring molecules were acquired and tested for binding. Out of 16 new, high-scoring compounds tested, 15 were observed to bind. All of these were small heterocyclic cations. Binding constants were measured for a few of these, they ranged between 20microM and 60microM. Crystal structures were determined for ten of these ligands in complex with the protein. The observed ligand geometry corresponded closely to that predicted by docking. Several low-scoring alkyl amino cations were also tested and found to bind. The low docking score of these molecules owed to the relatively high charge density of the charged amino group and the corresponding high desolvation penalty. When the complex structures of those ligands were determined, a bound water molecule was observed interacting with the amino group and a backbone carbonyl group of the cavity. This water molecule mitigates the desolvation penalty and improves the interaction energy relative to that of the "naked" site used in the docking screen. Finally, six low-scoring neutral molecules were also tested, with a view to looking for false negative predictions. Whereas most of these did not bind, two did (phenol and 3-fluorocatechol). Crystal structures for these two ligands in complex with the cavity site suggest reasons for their binding. That these neutral molecules do, in fact bind, contradicts previous results in this site and, along with the alkyl amines, provides instructive false negatives that help identify weaknesses in our scoring functions. Several improvements of these are considered.</p>

<p>Human somatic angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dependent exopeptidase, that catalyses the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to the octapeptide angiotensin II, by removing a C-terminal dipeptide. It is the principal component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood pressure. Hence it is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Here, we report the structures of an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE; a proven structural model for the more complex human ACE) co-crystallized with mammalian peptide substrates (bradykinin, Thr(6) -bradykinin, angiotensin I and a snake venom peptide inhibitor, bradykinin-potentiating peptide-b). The structures determined at 2-Å resolution illustrate that both angiotensin II (the cleaved product of angiotensin I by AnCE) and bradykinin-potentiating peptide-b bind in an analogous fashion at the active site of AnCE, but also exhibit significant differences. In addition, the binding of Arg-Pro-Pro, the cleavage product of bradykinin and Thr(6) - bradykinin, provides additional detail of the general peptide binding in AnCE. Thus the new structures of AnCE complexes presented here improves our understanding of the binding of peptides and the mechanism by which peptides inhibit this family of enzymes.</p>

<p>Druglike molecules are defined by Lipinski's rule of 5, to characterize fragment thresholds, they have been reduced from 5 to 3 (Astex's rule of 3). They are applied to assemble fragment libraries, and providers use them to select fragments for commercial offer. We question whether these rules are too stringent to compose fragment libraries with candidates exhibiting sufficient room for chemical subsequent growing and merging modifications as appropriate functional groups for chemical transformations are required. Usually these groups exhibit properties as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors and provide entry points for optimization chemistry. We therefore designed a fragment library (364 entries) without strictly applying the rule of 3. For initial screening for endothiapepsin binding, we performed a biochemical cleavage assay of a fluorogenic substrate at 1 mM. "Hits" were defined to inhibit the enzyme by at least 40%. Fifty-five hits were suggested and subsequently soaked into endothiapepsin crystals. Eleven crystal structures could be determined covering fragments with diverse binding modes: (i) direct binding to the catalytic dyad aspartates, (ii) water-mediated binding to the aspartates, (iii) no direct interaction with the dyad. They occupy different specificity pockets. Only 4 of the 11 fragments are consistent with the rule of 3. Restriction to this rule would have limited the fragment hits to a strongly reduced variety of chemotypes.</p>

<p>Acetylornithine aminotransferase (AcOAT) is one of the key enzymes involved in arginine metabolism and catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde to N-acetylornithine (AcOrn) in the presence of L-glutamate. It belongs to the Type I subgroup II family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes. E. coli biosynthetic AcOAT (eAcOAT) also catalyzes the conversion of N-succinyl-L-2-amino-6-oxopimelate to N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelate, one of the steps in lysine biosynthesis. In view of the critical role of AcOAT in lysine and arginine biosynthesis, structural studies were initiated on the enzyme from S. typhimurium (sAcOAT). The K(m) and k(cat)/K(m) values determined with the purified sAcOAT suggested that the enzyme had much higher affinity for AcOrn than for ornithine (Orn) and was more efficient than eAcOAT. sAcOAT was inhibited by gabaculine (Gcn) with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 7 microM and a second-order rate constant (k(2)) of 0.16 mM(-1) s(-1). sAcOAT, crystallized in the unliganded form and in the presence of Gcn or L-glutamate, diffracted to a maximum resolution of 1.90 A and contained a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure of unliganded sAcOAT showed significant electron density for PLP in only one of the subunits (subunit A). The asymmetry in PLP binding could be attributed to the ordering of the loop L(alphak-) (betam) in only one subunit (subunit B; the loop from subunit B comes close to the phosphate group of PLP in subunit A). Structural and spectral studies of sAcOAT with Gcn suggested that the enzyme might have a low affinity for PLP-Gcn complex. Comparison of sAcOAT with T. thermophilus AcOAT and human ornithine aminotransferase suggested that the higher specificity of sAcOAT towards AcOrn may not be due to specific changes in the active site residues but could result from minor conformational changes in some of them. This is the first structural report of AcOAT from a mesophilic organism and could serve as a basis for drug design as the enzyme is important for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.</p>

<p>To gain insights into the role of quaternary structure in the TIM-barrel family of enzymes, we introduced mutations to the DHDPS enzyme of Thermotoga maritima, which we have previously shown to be a stable tetramer in solution. These mutations were aimed at reducing the number of salt bridges at one of the two tetramerization interface of the enzyme, which contains many more interactions than the well characterized equivalent interface of the mesophilic Escherichia coli DHDPS enzyme. The resulting variants had altered quaternary structure, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation, gel filtration liquid chromatography, and small angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray crystallographic studies confirmed that one variant existed as an independent monomer, but with few changes to the secondary and tertiary structure. Reduction of higher order assembly resulted in a loss of thermal stability, as measured by a variety of methods, and impaired catalytic function. Binding of pyruvate increased the oligomeric status of the variants, with a concomitant increase in thermal stability, suggesting a role for substrate binding in optimizing stable, higher order structures. The results of this work show that the salt bridges located at the tetramerization interface of DHDPS play a significant role in maintaining higher order structures, and demonstrate the importance of quaternary structure in determining protein stability and in the optimization of enzyme catalysis.</p>

<p>The human lung cytochrome P450 2A13 (CYP2A13) activates the nicotine-derived procarcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) into DNA-altering compounds that cause lung cancer. Another cytochrome P450, CYP2A6, is also present in human lung, but at much lower levels. Although these two enzymes are 93.5% identical, CYP2A13 metabolizes NNK with much lower K(m) values than does CYP2A6. To investigate the structural differences between these two enzymes the structure of CYP2A13 was determined to 2.35A by x-ray crystallography and compared with structures of CYP2A6. As expected, the overall CYP2A13 and CYP2A6 structures are very similar with an average root mean square deviation of 0.5A for the Calpha atoms. Like CYP2A6, the CYP2A13 active site cavity is small and highly hydrophobic with a cluster of Phe residues composing the active site roof. Active site residue Asn(297) is positioned to hydrogen bond with an adventitious ligand, identified as indole. Amino acid differences between CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 at positions 117, 300, 301, and 208 relate to different orientations of the ligand plane in the two protein structures and may underlie the significant variations observed in binding and catalysis of many CYP2A ligands. In addition, docking studies suggest that residues 365 and 366 may also contribute to differences in NNK metabolism.</p>

<p>We have conducted a site-specific saturation mutagenesis study of H181 and H184 of flavoprotein pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETN reductase) to probe the role of these residues in substrate binding and catalysis with a variety of α,β-unsaturated alkenes. Single mutations at these residues were sufficient to dramatically increase the enantiopurity of products formed by reduction of 2-phenyl-1-nitropropene. In addition, many mutants exhibited a switch in reactivity to predominantly catalyse nitro reduction, as opposed to CC reduction. These mutants showed an enhancement in a minor side reaction and formed 2-phenylpropanal oxime from 2-phenyl-1-nitropropene. The multiple binding conformations of hydroxy substituted nitro-olefins in PETN reductase were examined by using both structural and catalytic techniques. These compounds were found to bind in both active and inhibitory complexes; this highlights the plasticity of the active site and the ability of the H181/H184 couple to coordinate with multiple functional groups. These properties demonstrate the potential to use PETN reductase as a scaffold in the development of industrially useful biocatalysts.</p>

<p>Molecular modeling was used to design a rigid analog of sitagliptin 1. The X-ray crystal structure of sitagliptin bound to DPP-4 suggested that the central beta-amino butyl amide moiety could be replaced with a cyclohexylamine group. This was confirmed by structural analysis and the resulting analog 2a was synthesized and found to be a potent DPP-4 inhibitor (IC(50)=21 nM) with excellent in vivo activity and pharmacokinetic profile.</p>

<p>The β-lactam antibiotics have long been a cornerstone for the treatment of bacterial disease. Recently, a readily transferable antibiotic resistance factor called the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) has been found to confer enteric bacteria resistance to nearly all β-lactams, including the heralded carbapenems, posing a serious threat to human health. The crystal structure of NDM-1 bound to meropenem shows for the first time the molecular details of how carbapenem antibiotics are recognized by dizinc-containing metallo-β-lactamases. Additionally, product complex structures of hydrolyzed benzylpenicillin-, methicillin-, and oxacillin-bound NDM-1 have been solved to 1.8, 1.2, and 1.2 Å, respectively, and represent the highest-resolution structural data for any metallo-β-lactamase reported to date. Finally, we present the crystal structure of NDM-1 bound to the potent competitive inhibitor l-captopril, which reveals a unique binding mechanism. An analysis of the NDM-1 active site in these structures reveals key features important for the informed design of novel inhibitors of NDM-1 and other metallo-β-lactamases.</p>

<p>Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) is one of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that require the cognate tRNA for specific amino acid recognition and activation. We analyzed the role of tRNA in amino acid recognition by crystallography. In the GluRS*tRNA(Glu)*Glu structure, GluRS and tRNA(Glu) collaborate to form a highly complementary L-glutamate-binding site. This collaborative site is functional, as it is formed in the same manner in pretransition-state mimic, GluRS*tRNA(Glu)*ATP*Eol (a glutamate analog), and posttransition-state mimic, GluRS*tRNA(Glu)*ESA (a glutamyl-adenylate analog) structures. In contrast, in the GluRS*Glu structure, only GluRS forms the amino acid-binding site, which is defective and accounts for the binding of incorrect amino acids, such as D-glutamate and L-glutamine. Therefore, tRNA(Glu) is essential for formation of the completely functional binding site for L-glutamate. These structures, together with our previously described structures, reveal that tRNA plays a crucial role in accurate positioning of both L-glutamate and ATP, thus driving the amino acid activation.</p>

<p>We have crystallized Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase and solved the structure of the native enzyme and of its complexes with two potent reversible inhibitors, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-(phenylmethyl)-9-acridinamine and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-(3-iodophenyl-methyl)-9-acridinamine--all three at 2.7 A resolution. The refined structure of D. melanogaster acetylcholinesterase is similar to that of vertebrate acetylcholinesterases, for example, human, mouse, and fish, in its overall fold, charge distribution, and deep active-site gorge, but some of the surface loops deviate by up to 8 A from their position in the vertebrate structures, and the C-terminal helix is shifted substantially. The active-site gorge of the insect enzyme is significantly narrower than that of Torpedo californica AChE, and its trajectory is shifted several angstroms. The volume of the lower part of the gorge of the insect enzyme is approximately 50% of that of the vertebrate enzyme. Upon binding of either of the two inhibitors, nine aromatic side chains within the active-site gorge change their conformation so as to interact with the inhibitors. Some differences in activity and specificity between the insect and vertebrate enzymes can be explained by comparison of their three-dimensional structures.</p>

<p>7,8-Dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the most common oxidative DNA lesions. 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylases (Oggs) detect and excise 8-oxoG through a multiple-step process. To better understand the basis for estranged base recognition, we have solved the crystal structures of MBOgg1, the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, in complex with DNA containing a tetrahydrofuranyl site (THF, a stable abasic site analog) paired with an estranged cytosine (MBOgg1/DNA(THF:C)) or thymine (MBOgg1/DNA(THF:T)). Different states of THF (extrahelical or intrahelical) are observed in the two complexes of the ASU of MBOgg1/DNA(THF:C) structure. Analyses of their different interaction modes reveal that variable contacts on the 5' region flanking the THF abasic site are correlated with the states of the THF. Comparison of MBOgg1/DNA(THF:T) with MBOgg1/DNA(THF:C) indicates that the non-preferred estranged T may affect MBOgg1's contacts with the 5' flank of the lesion strand. Furthermore, we identified a region in MBOgg1 that is rich in positive charges and interacts with the 5' region flanking the lesion. This region is conserved only in non-eukaryotic Oggs, and additional mutagenesis and biochemical assays reveal that it may contribute to the distinct estranged base specificities between eukaryotic and non-eukaryotic Oggs.</p>

<p>The mutation Ala28 to serine in human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, (HIV-1) protease introduces putative hydrogen bonds to each active-site carboxyl group. These hydrogen bonds are ubiquitous in pepsin-like eukaryotic aspartic proteases. In order to understand the significance of this difference between HIV-1 protease and homologous, eukaryotic aspartic proteases, we solved the three-dimensional structure of A28S mutant HIV-1 protease in complex with a peptidic inhibitor U-89360E. The structure has been determined to 2.0 A resolution with an R factor of 0.194. Comparison of the mutant enzyme structure with that of the wild-type HIV-1 protease bound to the same inhibitor (Hong L, Treharne A, Hartsuck JA, Foundling S, Tang J, 1996, Biochemistry 35:10627-10633) revealed double occupancy for the Ser28 hydroxyl group, which forms a hydrogen bond either to one of the oxygen atoms of the active-site carboxyl or to the carbonyl oxygen of Asp30. We also observed marked changes in orientation of the Asp25 catalytic carboxyl groups, presumably caused by the new hydrogen bonds. These observations suggest that catalytic aspartyl groups of HIV-1 protease have significant conformational flexibility unseen in eukaryotic aspartic proteases. This difference may provide an explanation for some unique catalytic properties of HIV-1 protease.</p>

<p>Deregulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway signaling through AGC kinases including AKT, p70S6 kinase, PKA, SGK and Rho kinase is a key driver of multiple cancers. The simultaneous inhibition of multiple AGC kinases may increase antitumor activity and minimize clinical resistance compared with a single pathway component.</p>

<p>The serine proteases are among the most thoroughly studied enzymes, and numerous crystal structures representing the enzyme-substrate complex and intermediates in the hydrolysis reactions have been reported. Some aspects of the catalytic mechanism remain controversial, however, especially the role of conformational changes in the reaction. We describe here a high-resolution (1.46 A) crystal structure of a complex formed between a cleaved form of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and a catalytically inactive trypsin variant with the BPTI cleavage site ideally positioned in the active site for resynthesis of the peptide bond. This structure defines the positions of the newly generated amino and carboxyl groups following the 2 steps in the hydrolytic reaction. Comparison of this structure with those representing other intermediates in the reaction demonstrates that the residues of the catalytic triad are positioned to promote each step of both the forward and reverse reaction with remarkably little motion and with conservation of hydrogen-bonding interactions. The results also provide insights into the mechanism by which inhibitors like BPTI normally resist hydrolysis when bound to their target proteases.</p>

<p>Mandelate racemase (MR) from Pseudomonas putida catalyzes the Mg(2+)-dependent 1,1-proton transfer that interconverts the enantiomers of mandelate. Because trifluorolactate is also a substrate of MR, we anticipated that replacing the phenyl rings of the competitive, substrate-product analogue inhibitor benzilate (Ki = 0.7 mM) with trifluoromethyl groups might furnish an inhibitor. Surprisingly, the substrate-product analogue 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanoate (TFHTP) was a potent competitive inhibitor [Ki = 27 ± 4 μM; cf. Km = 1.2 mM for both (R)-mandelate and (R)-trifluorolactate]. To understand the origins of this high binding affinity, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the MR-TFHTP complex to 1.68 Å resolution. Rather than chelating the active site Mg(2+) with its glycolate moiety, like other ground state analogues, TFHTP exhibited a novel binding mode with the two trifluoromethyl groups closely packed against the 20s loop and the carboxylate bridging the two active site Brønsted acid-base catalysts Lys 166 and His 297. Recognizing that positioning a carboxylate between the Brønsted acid-base catalysts could yield an inhibitor, we showed that tartronate was a competitive inhibitor of MR (Ki = 1.8 ± 0.1 mM). The X-ray crystal structure of the MR-tartronate complex (1.80 Å resolution) revealed that the glycolate moiety of tartronate chelated the Mg(2+) and that the carboxylate bridged Lys 166 and His 297. Models of tartronate in monomers A and B of the crystal structure mimicked the binding orientations of (S)-mandelate and that anticipated for (R)-mandelate, respectively. For the latter monomer, the 20s loop appeared to be disordered, as it also did in the X-ray structure of the MR triple mutant (C92S/C264S/K166C) complexed with benzilate, which was determined to 1.89 Å resolution. These observations indicate that the 20s loop likely undergoes a significant conformational change upon binding (R)-mandelate. In general, our observations suggest that inhibitors of other enolase superfamily enzymes may be designed to capitalize on the recognition of the active site Brønsted acid-base catalysts as binding determinants. </p>

<p>We have determined the structure of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in an E2.P(i)-like form stabilized as a complex with MgF(4)(2-), an ATP analog, adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate (AMPPCP), and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). The structure determined at 2.5A resolution leads to a significantly revised model of CPA binding when compared with earlier reports. It shows that a divalent metal ion is required for CPA binding through coordination of the tetramic acid moiety at a characteristic kink of the M1 helix found in all P-type ATPase structures, which is expected to be part of the cytoplasmic cation access pathway. Our model is consistent with the biochemical data on CPA function and provides new measures in structure-based drug design targeting Ca(2+)-ATPases, e.g. from pathogens. We also present an extended structural basis of ATP modulation pinpointing key residues at or near the ATP binding site. A structural comparison to the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase reveals that the Phe(93) side chain occupies the equivalent binding pocket of the CPA site in SERCA, suggesting an important role of this residue in stabilization of the potassium-occluded E2 state of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase.</p>

<p>Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) represents an important target for the treatment of hyperproliferative and inflammatory diseases. In the cell DHODH catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. DHODH inhibition results in beneficial immunosuppressant and antiproliferative effects in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we present high-resolution X-ray structures of human DHODH in complex with a novel class of low molecular weight compounds that inhibit the enzyme in the nanomolar range. Some compounds showed an interesting dual binding mode within the same cocrystal strongly depending on the nature of chemical substitution. Measured in vitro activity data correlated with the prevailing mode of binding and explained the observed structure-activity relationship. Additionally, the X-ray data confirmed the competitive nature of the inhibitors toward the putative ubiquinone binding site and will guide structure-based design and synthesis of molecules with higher activity.</p>

<p>Proteins crucial for the respiratory chain are translated by the mitochondrial ribosome. Mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis is therefore critical for oxidative phosphorylation capacity and disturbances are known to cause human disease. This complex process is evolutionary conserved and involves several RNA processing and modification steps required for correct ribosomal RNA maturation. We recently showed that a member of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (MTERF) family of proteins, MTERF4, recruits NSUN4, a 5-methylcytosine RNA methyltransferase, to the large ribosomal subunit in a process crucial for mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. Here, we describe the 3D crystal structure of the human MTERF4-NSUN4 complex determined to 2.9 Å resolution. MTERF4 is composed of structurally repeated MTERF-motifs that form a nucleic acid binding domain. NSUN4 lacks an N- or C-terminal extension that is commonly used for RNA recognition by related RNA methyltransferases. Instead, NSUN4 binds to the C-terminus of MTERF4. A positively charged surface forms an RNA binding path from the concave to the convex side of MTERF4 and further along NSUN4 all of the way into the active site. This finding suggests that both subunits of the protein complex likely contribute to RNA recognition. The interface between MTERF4 and NSUN4 contains evolutionarily conserved polar and hydrophobic amino acids, and mutations that change these residues completely disrupt complex formation. This study provides a molecular explanation for MTERF4-dependent recruitment of NSUN4 to ribosomal RNA and suggests a unique mechanism by which other members of the large MTERF-family of proteins can regulate ribosomal biogenesis.</p>

<p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on biotin synthesis for survival during infection. In the absence of biotin, disruption of the biotin biosynthesis pathway results in cell death rather than growth arrest, an unusual phenotype for an Mtb auxotroph. Humans lack the enzymes for biotin production, making the proteins of this essential Mtb pathway promising drug targets. To this end, we have determined the crystal structures of the second and third enzymes of the Mtb biotin biosynthetic pathway, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase (DAPAS) and dethiobiotin synthetase (DTBS), at respective resolutions of 2.2 and 1.85 A. Superimposition of the DAPAS structures bound either to the SAM analogue sinefungin or to 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA) allowed us to map the putative binding site for the substrates and to propose a mechanism by which the enzyme accommodates their disparate structures. Comparison of the DTBS structures bound to the substrate 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) or to ADP and the product dethiobiotin (DTB) permitted derivation of an enzyme mechanism. There are significant differences between the Mtb enzymes and those of other organisms; the Bacillus subtilis DAPAS, presented here at a high resolution of 2.2 A, has active site variations and the Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori DTBS have alterations in their overall folds. We have begun to exploit the unique characteristics of the Mtb structures to design specific inhibitors against the biotin biosynthesis pathway in Mtb.</p>

<p>Phosphinothricin is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). The resolution of the native structure of GS from Salmonella typhimurium has been extended to 2.5 A resolution, and the improved model is used to determine the structure of phosphinothricin complexed to GS by difference Fourier methods. The structure suggests a noncovalent, dead-end mechanism of inhibition. Phosphinothricin occupies the glutamate substrate pocket and stabilizes the Glu327 flap in a position which blocks the glutamate entrance to the active site, trapping the inhibitor on the enzyme. One oxygen of the phosphinyl group of phosphinothricin appears to be protonated, because of its proximity to the carboxylate group of Glu327. The other phosphinyl oxygen protrudes into the negatively charged binding pocket for the substrate ammonium, disrupting that pocket. The distribution of charges in the glutamate binding pocket is complementary to those of phosphinothricin. The presence of a second ammonium binding site within the active site is confirmed by its analogue thallous ion, marking the ammonium site and its protein ligands. The inhibition of GS by methionine sulfoximine can be explained by the same mechanism. These models of inhibited GS further illuminate its catalytic mechanism.</p>

<p>Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes the first unique step of the GMP branch of the purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme is found in organisms of all three kingdoms. IMPDH inhibitors have broad clinical applications in cancer treatment, as antiviral drugs and as immunosuppressants, and have also displayed antibiotic activity. We have determined three crystal structures of Bacillus anthracis IMPDH, in a phosphate ion-bound (termed "apo") form and in complex with its substrate, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), and product, xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP). This is the first example of a bacterial IMPDH in more than one state from the same organism. Furthermore, for the first time for a prokaryotic enzyme, the entire active site flap, containing the conserved Arg-Tyr dyad, is clearly visible in the structure of the apoenzyme. Kinetic parameters for the enzymatic reaction were also determined, and the inhibitory effect of XMP and mycophenolic acid (MPA) has been studied. In addition, the inhibitory potential of two known Cryptosporidium parvum IMPDH inhibitors was examined for the B. anthracis enzyme and compared with those of three bacterial IMPDHs from Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio cholerae. The structures contribute to the characterization of the active site and design of inhibitors that specifically target B. anthracis and other microbial IMPDH enzymes.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the membrane-bound O(2)-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase 1 from Escherichia coli (EcHyd-1) has been solved in three different states: as-isolated, H(2)-reduced, and chemically oxidized. As very recently reported for similar enzymes from Ralstonia eutropha and Hydrogenovibrio marinus, two supernumerary Cys residues coordinate the proximal [FeS] cluster in EcHyd-1, which lacks one of the inorganic sulfide ligands. We find that the as-isolated, aerobically purified species contains a mixture of at least two conformations for one of the cluster iron ions and Glu76. In one of them, Glu76 and the iron occupy positions that are similar to those found in O(2)-sensitive [NiFe]-hydrogenases. In the other conformation, this iron binds, besides three sulfur ligands, the amide N from Cys20 and one Oε of Glu76. Our calculations show that oxidation of this unique iron generates the high-potential form of the proximal cluster. The structural rearrangement caused by oxidation is confirmed by our H(2)-reduced and oxidized EcHyd-1 structures. Thus, thanks to the peculiar coordination of the unique iron, the proximal cluster can contribute two successive electrons to secure complete reduction of O(2) to H(2)O at the active site. The two observed conformations of Glu76 are consistent with this residue playing the role of a base to deprotonate the amide moiety of Cys20 upon iron binding and transfer the resulting proton away, thus allowing the second oxidation to be electroneutral. The comparison of our structures also shows the existence of a dynamic chain of water molecules, resulting from O(2) reduction, located near the active site.</p>

<p>The molecular structure of the ATP phosphoribosyl transferase from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima is composed of a 220 kDa hetero-octameric complex comprising four catalytic subunits (HisGS) and four regulatory subunits (HisZ). Steady-state kinetics indicate that only the complete octameric complex is active and non-competitively inhibited by the pathway product histidine. The rationale for these findings is provided by the crystal structure revealing a total of eight histidine binding sites that are located within each of the four HisGS-HisZ subunit interfaces formed by the ATP phosphoribosyl transferase complex. While the structure of the catalytic HisGS subunit is related to the catalytic domain of another family of (HisGL)2 ATP phosphoribosyl transferases that is functional in the absence of additional regulatory subunits, the structure of the regulatory HisZ subunit is distantly related to class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. However, neither the mode of the oligomeric subunit arrangement nor the type of histidine binding pockets is found in these structural relatives. Common ancestry of the regulatory HisZ subunit and class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase may reflect the balanced need of regulated amounts of a cognate amino acid (histidine) in the translation apparatus, ultimately linking amino acid biosynthesis and protein biosynthesis in terms of function, structure and evolution.</p>

<p>The first subatomic resolution structure of a 36 kDa protein [aldose reductase (AR)] is presented. AR was cocrystallized at pH 5.0 with its cofactor NADP+ and inhibitor IDD 594, a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of diabetic complications. X-ray diffraction data were collected up to 0.62 A resolution and treated up to 0.66 A resolution. Anisotropic refinement followed by a blocked matrix inversion produced low standard deviations (&lt;0.005 A). The model was very well ordered overall (CA atoms' mean B factor is 5.5 A2). The model and the electron-density maps revealed fine features, such as H-atoms, bond densities, and significant deviations from standard stereochemistry. Other features, such as networks of hydrogen bonds (H bonds), a large number of multiple conformations, and solvent structure were also better defined. Most of the atoms in the active site region were extremely well ordered (mean B approximately 3 A2), leading to the identification of the protonation states of the residues involved in catalysis. The electrostatic interactions of the inhibitor's charged carboxylate head with the catalytic residues and the charged coenzyme NADP+ explained the inhibitor's noncompetitive character. Furthermore, a short contact involving the IDD 594 bromine atom explained the selectivity profile of the inhibitor, important feature to avoid toxic effects. The presented structure and the details revealed are instrumental for better understanding of the inhibition mechanism of AR by IDD 594, and hence, for the rational drug design of future inhibitors. This work demonstrates the capabilities of subatomic resolution experiments and stimulates further developments of methods allowing the use of the full potential of these experiments.</p>

<p>The tremendous social and economic impact of thrombotic disorders, together with the considerable risks associated to the currently available therapies, prompt for the development of more efficient and safer anticoagulants. Novel peptide-based thrombin inhibitors were identified using in silico structure-based design and further validated in vitro. The best candidate compounds contained both L- and D-amino acids, with the general sequence D-Phe(P3)-Pro(P2)-D-Arg(P1)-P1'-CONH₂. The P1' position was scanned with L- and D-isomers of natural or unnatural amino acids, covering the major chemical classes. The most potent non-covalent and proteolysis-resistant inhibitors contain small hydrophobic or polar amino acids (Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Thr) at the P1' position. The lead tetrapeptide, D-Phe-Pro-D-Arg-D-Thr-CONH₂, competitively inhibits α-thrombin's cleavage of the S2238 chromogenic substrate with a K(i) of 0.92 µM. In order to understand the molecular details of their inhibitory action, the three-dimensional structure of three peptides (with P1' L-isoleucine (fPrI), L-cysteine (fPrC) or D-threonine (fPrt)) in complex with human α-thrombin were determined by X-ray crystallography. All the inhibitors bind in a substrate-like orientation to the active site of the enzyme. The contacts established between the D-Arg residue in position P1 and thrombin are similar to those observed for the L-isomer in other substrates and inhibitors. However, fPrC and fPrt disrupt the active site His57-Ser195 hydrogen bond, while the combination of a P1 D-Arg and a bulkier P1' residue in fPrI induce an unfavorable geometry for the nucleophilic attack of the scissile bond by the catalytic serine. The experimental models explain the observed relative potency of the inhibitors, as well as their stability to proteolysis. Moreover, the newly identified direct thrombin inhibitors provide a novel pharmacophore platform for developing antithrombotic agents by exploring the conformational constrains imposed by the D-stereochemistry of the residues at positions P1 and P1'.</p>

<p>Depending on the excess of ligand used for complex formation, the HIV-1 protease complexed with a novel phenylnorstatine inhibitor forms crystals of either hexagonal (P6(1)) or orthorhombic (P2(1)2(1)2(1)) symmetry. The orthorhombic form shows an unusual complexity of crystal packing: in addition to one inhibitor molecule that is bound to the enzyme active site, the second inhibitor molecule is bound as an outer ligand at the protein interface. Binding of the outer ligand apparently increases the crystal-quality parameters so that the diffraction data allow solution of the structure of the complex at 1.03 A, the best resolution reported to date. The outer ligand interacts with all four surrounding HIV-1 protease molecules and has a bent conformation owing to its accommodation in the intermolecular space. The parameters of the solved structures of the orthorhombic and hexagonal forms are compared.</p>

<p>GlvA, a 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase from Bacillus subtilis, catalyzes the hydrolysis of maltose-6'-phosphate and belongs to glycoside hydrolase family GH4. GH4 enzymes are unique in their requirement for NAD(H) and a divalent metal for activity. We have determined the crystal structure of GlvA in complex with its ligands to 2.05 A resolution. Analyses of the active site architecture, in conjunction with mechanistic studies and precedent from the nucleotide diphosphate hexose dehydratases and other systems, suggest a novel mechanism of glycoside hydrolysis by GlvA that involves both the NAD(H) and the metal.</p>

<p>In a calcium-dependent interaction critical for blood coagulation, vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins bind cell membranes containing phosphatidylserine via gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) domains. Gla domain-mediated protein-membrane interaction is required for generation of thrombin, the terminal enzyme in the coagulation cascade, on a physiologic time scale. We determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy the lysophosphatidylserine-binding site in the bovine prothrombin Gla domain. The serine head group binds Gla domain-bound calcium ions and Gla residues 17 and 21, fixed elements of the Gla domain fold, predicting the structural basis for phosphatidylserine specificity among Gla domains. Gla domains provide a unique mechanism for protein-phospholipid membrane interaction. Increasingly Gla domains are being identified in proteins unrelated to blood coagulation. Thus, this membrane-binding mechanism may be important in other physiologic processes.</p>

<p>Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) represents an important therapeutic target for the prevention of brain injury and the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. A series of trans-substituted amino pyrrolidinomethyl 2-aminopyridine derivatives (8-34) was designed and synthesized. A structure-activity relationship analysis led to the discovery of low nanomolar nNOS inhibitors ((±)-32 and (±)-34) with more than 1000-fold selectivity for nNOS over eNOS. Four enantiomerically pure isomers of 3'-[2''-(3'''-fluorophenethylamino)ethoxy]pyrrolidin-4'-yl}methyl}-4-methylpyridin-2-amine (4) also were synthesized. It was found that (3'R,4'R)-4 can induce enzyme elasticity to generate a new "hot spot" for ligand binding. The inhibitor adopts a unique binding mode, the same as that observed for (3'R,4'R)-3'-[2''-(3'''-fluorophenethylamino)ethylamino]pyrrolidin-4'-yl}methyl}-4-methylpyridin-2-amine ((3'R,4'R)-3) (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132 (15), 5437 - 5442). On the basis of structure-activity relationships of 8-34 and different binding conformations of the cis and trans isomers of 3 and 4, critical structural requirements of the NOS active site for ligand binding are revealed.</p>

<p>The complex fac-[Mo(CO)(3)(histidinate)]Na has been reported to be an effective CO-Releasing Molecule in vivo, eliciting therapeutic effects in several animal models of disease. The CO releasing profile of this complex in different settings both in vitro and in vivo reveals that the compound can readily liberate all of its three CO equivalents under biological conditions. The compound has low toxicity and cytotoxicity and is not hemolytic. CO release is accompanied by a decrease in arterial blood pressure following administration in vivo. We studied its behavior in solution and upon the interaction with proteins. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation upon exposure to air and polyoxomolybdate formation in soaks with lysozyme crystals were observed as processes ensuing from the decomposition of the complex and the release of CO.</p>

<p>Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is the only enzyme known to catalyse hydrolysis of the O-glycosidic linkages of ADP-ribose polymers, thereby reversing the effects of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. PARG deficiency leads to cell death whilst PARG depletion causes sensitisation to certain DNA damaging agents, implicating PARG as a potential therapeutic target in several disease areas. Efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors of PARG activity have until recently been hampered by a lack of structural information on PARG. We have used a combination of bio-informatic and experimental approaches to engineer a crystallisable, catalytically active fragment of human PARG (hPARG). Here, we present high-resolution structures of the catalytic domain of hPARG in unliganded form and in complex with three inhibitors: ADP-ribose (ADPR), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidinediol (ADP-HPD) and 8-n-octyl-amino-ADP-HPD. Our structures confirm conservation of overall fold amongst mammalian PARG glycohydrolase domains, whilst revealing additional flexible regions in the catalytic site. These new structures rationalise a body of published mutational data and the reported structure-activity relationship for ADP-HPD based PARG inhibitors. In addition, we have developed and used biochemical, isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance assays to characterise the binding of inhibitors to our PARG protein, thus providing a starting point for the design of new inhibitors.</p>

<p>We showed earlier that the mutation of Leu99 to alanine in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme creates an internal cavity of volume approximately 150 A(3) that binds benzene and a variety of other ligands. As such, this cavity provides an excellent target to study protein-ligand interaction. Here, we use low-temperature crystallography and related techniques to analyze the binding of halogen-incorporated benzenes typified by C(6)F(5)X, where X=H, F, Cl, Br or I, and C(6)H(5)X, where X=H or I was also studied. Because of the increased electron density of fluorine relative to hydrogen, the geometry of binding of the fluoro compounds can often be determined more precisely than their hydrogen-containing analogs. All of the ligands bind in essentially the same plane but the center of the phenyl ring can translate by up to 1.2 A. In no case does the ligand rotate freely within the cavity. The walls of the cavity consist predominantly of hydrocarbon atoms, and in several cases it appears that van der Waals interactions define the geometry of binding. In comparing the smallest with the largest ligand, the cavity volume increases from 181 A(3) to 245 A(3). This shows that the protein is flexible and adapts to the size and shape of the ligand. There is a remarkably close contact of 3.0 A between the iodine atom on C(6)F(5)I and the sulfur or selenium atom of Met or SeMet102. This interaction is 1.0 A less than the sum of the van der Waals radii and is a clear example of a so-called halogen bond. Notwithstanding this close approach, the increase in binding energy for the halogen bond relative to a van der Waals contact is estimated to be only about 0.5-0.7 kcal/mol.</p>

<p>The synthesis of substituted 3,4-dihydrofuranoindoles is reported. These new indole compounds were used to synthesize potent HCV NS5B inhibitors. The binding mode of the dihydrofuranoindole-derived inhibitors was established via X-ray crystallographic studies.</p>

<p>The genus Burkholderia includes pathogenic gram-negative bacteria that cause melioidosis, glanders, and pulmonary infections of patients with cancer and cystic fibrosis. Drug resistance has made development of new antimicrobials critical.

<p>Arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) is the aldopentose version of the ketohexose fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), having identical stereochemistry but lacking atoms corresponding to the 1-carbon and 1-hydroxyl. Despite structural similarity and conservation of the reactive portion of F6P, F6P acts as a substrate whereas A5P is reported to be an inhibitor of transaldolase. To address the lack of A5P reactivity we determined a crystal structure of the Francisella tularensis transaldolase in complex with A5P. This structure reveals that like F6P, A5P forms a covalent Schiff base with active site Lys135. Unlike F6P, A5P binding fails to displace an ordered active site water molecule. Retaining this water necessitates conformational changes at the A5P-protein linkage that possibly hinder reactivity. The findings presented here show the basis of A5P inhibition and suggest an unusual mechanism of competitive, reversible-covalent transaldolase regulation. </p>

<p>Among the numerous well-characterized families of glycosidases, family 4 appears to be the anomaly, requiring both catalytic NAD+ and a divalent metal for activity. The unusual cofactor requirement prompted the proposal of a mechanism involving key NAD+-mediated redox steps as well as elimination of the glycosidic oxygen. Primary kinetic isotope effects for the 2- and 3-deutero substrate analogues, isotopic exchange with solvent, and structural analysis of a 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase, BglT (E.C. 3.2.1.6), provided evidence in support of the proposed mechanism, which has striking resemblances to that of the sugar dehydratases. Furthermore, analysis of the stereochemical outcome indicated that family 4 enzymes are retaining glycosidases.</p>

<p>The import of disaccharides by many bacteria is achieved through their simultaneous translocation and phosphorylation by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PEP-PTS). The imported phospho-disaccharides are, in some cases, subsequently hydrolyzed by members of the unusual glycoside hydrolase family GH4. The GH4 enzymes, occasionally found also in bacteria such as Thermotoga maritima that do not utilise a PEP-PTS system, require both NAD(+) and Mn(2+) for catalysis. A further curiosity of this family is that closely related enzymes may show specificity for either alpha-d- or beta-d-glycosides. Here, we present, for the first time, the three-dimensional structure (using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods, harnessing extensive non-crystallographic symmetry) of the 6-phospho-beta-glycosidase, BglT, from T.maritima in native and complexed (NAD(+) and Glc6P) forms. Comparison of the active-center structure with that of the 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase GlvA from Bacillus subtilis reveals a striking degree of structural similarity that, in light of previous kinetic isotope effect data, allows the postulation of a common reaction mechanism for both alpha and beta-glycosidases. Given that the "chemistry" occurs primarily on the glycone sugar and features no nucleophilic attack on the intact disaccharide substrate, modulation of anomeric specificity for alpha and beta-linkages is accommodated through comparatively minor structural changes.</p>

<p>Escherichia coli glycogen synthase (EcGS, EC 2.4.1.21) is a retaining glycosyltransferase (GT) that transfers glucose from adenosine diphosphate glucose to a glucan chain acceptor with retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon. EcGS belongs to the GT-B structural superfamily. Here we report several EcGS x-ray structures that together shed considerable light on the structure and function of these enzymes. The structure of the wild-type enzyme bound to ADP and glucose revealed a 15.2 degrees overall domain-domain closure and provided for the first time the structure of the catalytically active, closed conformation of a glycogen synthase. The main chain carbonyl group of His-161, Arg-300, and Lys-305 are suggested by the structure to act as critical catalytic residues in the transglycosylation. Glu-377, previously thought to be catalytic is found on the alpha-face of the glucose and plays an electrostatic role in the active site and as a glucose ring locator. This is also consistent with the structure of the EcGS(E377A)-ADP-HEPPSO complex where the glucose moiety is either absent or disordered in the active site.</p>

<p>The Mycobacterium tuberculosis acid-induced operon MymA encodes the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase FadD13 and is essential for virulence and intracellular growth of the pathogen. Fatty acyl-CoA synthetases activate lipids before entering into the metabolic pathways and are also involved in transmembrane lipid transport. Unlike soluble fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, but like the mammalian integral-membrane very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, FadD13 accepts lipid substrates up to the maximum length tested (C(26)). Here, we show that FadD13 is a peripheral membrane protein. The structure and mutational studies reveal an arginine- and aromatic-rich surface patch as the site for membrane interaction. The protein accommodates a hydrophobic tunnel that extends from the active site toward the positive patch and is sealed by an arginine-rich lid-loop at the protein surface. Based on this and previous data, we propose a structural basis for accommodation of lipid substrates longer than the enzyme and transmembrane lipid transport by vectorial CoA-esterification.</p>

<p>Obesity and type II diabetes are closely linked metabolic syndromes that afflict &gt;100 million people worldwide. Although protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of both syndromes, the discovery of pharmaceutically acceptable inhibitors that bind at the active site remains a substantial challenge. Here we describe the discovery of an allosteric site in PTP1B. Crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with allosteric inhibitors reveal a novel site located approximately 20 A from the catalytic site. We show that allosteric inhibitors prevent formation of the active form of the enzyme by blocking mobility of the catalytic loop, thereby exploiting a general mechanism used by tyrosine phosphatases. Notably, these inhibitors exhibit selectivity for PTP1B and enhance insulin signaling in cells. Allosteric inhibition is a promising strategy for targeting PTP1B and constitutes a mechanism that may be applicable to other tyrosine phosphatases.</p>

<p>Vibrational Stark effect spectroscopy was used to measure electrostatic fields in the hydrophobic region of the active site of human aldose reductase (hALR2). A new nitrile-containing inhibitor was designed and synthesized, and the X-ray structure of its complex, along with cofactor NADP(+), with wild-type hALR2 was determined at 1.3 Å resolution. The nitrile is found to be in the proximity of T113, consistent with a hydrogen bond interaction. Two vibrational absorption peaks were observed at room temperature in the nitrile region when the inhibitor binds to wild-type hALR2, indicating that the nitrile probe experiences two different microenvironments, and these could be empirically separated into a hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded population by comparison with the T113A mutant, in which a hydrogen bond to the nitrile is not present. Classical molecular dynamics simulations based on the structure predict a double-peak distribution in protein electric fields projected along the nitrile probe. The interpretation of these two peaks as a hydrogen bond formation-dissociation process between the probe nitrile group and a nearby amino acid side chain is used to explain the observation of two IR bands, and the simulations were used to investigate the molecular details of this conformational change. Hydrogen bonding complicates the simplest analysis of vibrational frequency shifts as being due solely to electrostatic interactions through the vibrational Stark effect, and the consequences of this complication are discussed.</p>

<p>Isocitrate dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsIDH) is a member of a family of metal-dependent decarboxylating dehydrogenases. Its crystal structure was solved to 1.55 A and detailed comparisons with the homologue from Escherichia coli (EcIDH), the founding member of this family, were made. Although the two IDHs are structurally similar, there are three notable differences between them. First, a mostly nonpolar beta-strand and two connecting loops in the small domain of EcIDH are replaced by two polar alpha-helices in BsIDH. Because of a 13-residue insert in this region of BsIDH, these helices protrude over the active site cleft of the opposing monomer. Second, a coil leading into this cleft, the so-called "phosphorylation" loop, is bent inward in the B. subtilis enzyme, narrowing the entrance to the active site from about 12 to 4 A. Third, although BsIDH is a homodimer, the two unique crystallographic subunits of BsIDH are not structurally identical. The two monomers appear to differ by a domain shift of the large domain relative to the small domain/clasp region, reminiscent of what has been observed in the open/closed conformations of EcIDH. In Escherichia coli, IDH is regulated by reversible phosphorylation by the bifunctional enzyme IDH kinase/phosphatase (IDH-K/P). The site of phosphorylation is Ser(113), which lies deep within the active site crevice. Structural differences between EcIDH and BsIDH may explain disparities in their abilities to act as substrates for IDH-K/P.</p>

<p>Yeast glutathione (GSH) reductase Glr1 is a dimeric flavo-oxidoreductase involved in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial redox regulatory systems. It reduces the oxidized GSH GSSG to the reduced form, GSH with NADPH as electron donor and FAD as coenzyme. Crystal structures and enzymatic mechanisms of GSH reductases from Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens have been well investigated, whereas the structural properties of yeast Glr1 remain unknown. Herein, we overexpressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae Glr1 in Pichia pastoris GS115 and determined its crystal structure at 2.40 A resolution. Although the overall structure and the active site are much conserved, obvious variety was found at the interface of Glr1 monomers when superimposed against the homolog from E. coli or human. The nonconserved C239 is exposed to the solvent and accessible to GSH or GSSG enriched in a microenvironment around the Glr1 molecules, leading to the partial and transient glutathionylation, as primarily identified from the 2Fo-Fc electron density map and further confirmed by biochemical assays. Meanwhile N278 at the vicinity of NADP-binding pocket was artificially glycosylated when heterogeneously overexpressed in P. pastoris. The highly motile oligosaccharide chain linked to N278 of the recombinant Glr1 interferes with the entry of NADPH, which results in a dramatic increase of Km for NAPDH and a significant decrease of turnover number, when compared with the native protein.</p>

<p>Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of the genetically encoded guanine at the wobble position of tRNAs(His,Tyr,Asp,Asn) by the premodified base preQ1, which is further converted to queuine at the tRNA level. As eucaryotes are not able to synthesise queuine de novo but acquire it through their diet, eucaryotic Tgt directly inserts the hypermodified base into the wobble position of the tRNAs mentioned above. Bacterial Tgt is required for the efficient pathogenicity of Shigella sp, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and, hence, it constitutes a putative target for the rational design of anti-Shigellosis compounds. Since mammalian Tgt is known to be indirectly essential to the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, it is necessary to create substances which only inhibit bacterial but not eucaryotic Tgt. Therefore, it seems of utmost importance to study selectivity-determining features within both types of proteins. Homology models of Caenorhabditis elegans Tgt and human Tgt suggest that the replacement of Cys158 and Val233 in bacterial Tgt (Zymomonas mobilis Tgt numbering) by valine and accordingly glycine in eucaryotic Tgt largely accounts for the different substrate specificities. In the present study we have created mutated variants of Z. mobilis Tgt in order to investigate the impact of a Cys158Val and a Val233Gly exchange on catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we gained evidence that the Cys158Val mutation reduces the affinity to preQ1 while leaving the affinity to guanine unaffected. The Val233Gly exchange leads to an enlarged substrate binding pocket, that is necessary to accommodate queuine in a conformation compatible with the intermediately covalently bound tRNA molecule. Contrary to our expectations, we found that a priori queuine is recognised by the binding pocket of bacterial Tgt without, however, being used as a substrate.</p>

<p>The key enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) has been shown to be the target enzyme of fosmidomycin, an antimalarial, antibacterial and herbicidal compound. Here we report the crystal structure of selenomethionine-labelled Escherichia coli DXR in a ternary complex with NADPH and fosmidomycin at 2.2 A resolution. The structure reveals a considerable conformational rearrangement upon fosmidomycin binding and provides insights into the slow, tight binding inhibition mode of the inhibitor. Although the inhibitor displays an unusual non-metal mediated mode of inhibition, which is an artefact most likely due to the low metal affinity of DXR at the pH used for crystallization, the structural data add valuable information for the rational design of novel DXR inhibitors. Using this structure together with the published structural data and the 1.9 A crystal structure of DXR in a ternary complex with NADPH and the substrate 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, a model for the physiologically relevant tight-binding mode of inhibition is proposed. The structure of the substrate complex must be interpreted with caution due to the presence of a second diastereomer in the active site.</p>

<p>The reaction of the new and structurally characterized covalent {Mn(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(2)}(+)-lysozyme adduct with NiS(4) and NiN(2)S(2) complexes generates binuclear Ni-Mn complexes; relevance to the reactivity of the protein-bound {Fe(CO)(CN)(2)} intermediate during maturation of [NiFe] hydrogenases is discussed.</p>

<p>Terminal RNA uridylyltransferases (TUTases) catalyze template-independent UMP addition to the 3' hydroxyl of RNA. TUTases belong to the DNA polymerase beta superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases that share a conserved catalytic domain bearing three metal-binding carboxylate residues. We have previously determined crystal structures of the UTP-bound and apo forms of the minimal trypanosomal TUTase, TbTUT4, which is composed solely of the N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal base-recognition domains. Here we report crystal structures of TbTUT4 with bound CTP, GTP, and ATP, demonstrating nearly perfect superposition of the triphosphate moieties with that of the UTP substrate. Consequently, at physiological nucleoside 5'-triphosphate concentrations, the protein-uracil base interactions alone are not sufficient to confer UTP selectivity. To resolve this ambiguity, we determined the crystal structure of a prereaction ternary complex composed of UTP, TbTUT4, and UMP, which mimics an RNA substrate, and the postreaction complex of TbTUT4 with UpU dinucleotide. The UMP pyrimidine ring stacks against the uracil base of the bound UTP, which on its other face also stacks with an essential tyrosine. In contrast, the different orientation of the purine bases observed in cocrystals with ATP and GTP prevents this triple stacking, precluding productive binding of the RNA. The 3' hydroxyl of the bound UMP is poised for in-line nucleophilic attack while contributing to the formation of a binding site for a second catalytic metal ion. We propose a dual role for RNA substrates in TUTase-catalyzed reactions: contribution to selective incorporation of the cognate nucleoside and shaping of the catalytic metal binding site.</p>

<p>Cytosine DNA methylation is evolutionarily ancient, and in eukaryotes this epigenetic modification is associated with gene silencing. Proteins with SRA (SET- or RING-associated) methyl-binding domains are required for the establishment and/or maintenance of DNA methylation in both plants and mammals. The 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC)-binding specificity of several SRA domains have been characterized, and each one has a preference for DNA methylation in different sequence contexts. Here we demonstrate through mobility shift assays and calorimetric measurements that the SU(VAR)3-9 HOMOLOG 5 (SUVH5) SRA domain differs from other SRA domains in that it can bind methylated DNA in all contexts to similar extents. Crystal structures of the SUVH5 SRA domain bound to 5mC-containing DNA in either the fully or hemimethylated CG context or the methylated CHH context revealed a dual flip-out mechanism where both the 5mC and a base (5mC, C, or G, respectively) from the partner strand are simultaneously extruded from the DNA duplex and positioned within binding pockets of individual SRA domains. Our structure-based in vivo studies suggest that a functional SUVH5 SRA domain is required for both DNA methylation and accumulation of the H3K9 dimethyl modification in vivo, suggesting a role for the SRA domain in recruitment of SUVH5 to genomic loci.</p>

<p>The active center of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a target site for competitive inhibitors, resides centrosymmetric to the subunit at the base of a deep, narrow gorge lined by aromatic residues. At the gorge entry, a peripheral site encompasses overlapping binding loci for noncompetitive inhibitors, which alter substrate access to the gorge. The click-chemistry inhibitor TZ2PA6 links the active center ligand, tacrine, to the peripheral site ligand, propidium, through a biorthogonal reaction of an acetylene and an azide that forms either a syn1 or an anti1 triazole. Compared with wild-type mouse AChE, a Tyr337Ala mutant displays full catalytic activity, albeit with 2-3 orders of magnitude higher affinities for the TZ2PA6 syn1 and anti1 regioisomers, reflected in low femtomolar K(d) values, diffusion-limited association, and dissociation half-times greater than 1 month and 1 week, respectively. Three structures of each of the co-crystallized syn1 and anti1 complexes of the Tyr337Ala mutant were solved at three distinct times of crystal maturation, consistent with or exceeding the half-lives of the complexes in solution, while crystalline complexes obtained from soaked Tyr337Ala crystals led to picturing "freshly formed" complexes. The structures, at 2.55-2.75 Å resolution, reveal a range of unprecedented conformations of the bound regioisomers, not observed in the wild-type AChE complexes, associated with concerted positional rearrangements of side chains in the enzyme gorge. Moreover, time-dependent conformational remodeling of the crystalline complexes appears to correlate with the dissociation half-times of the solution complexes. Hence, for the tight-binding TZ2PA6 inhibitors, the initial complexes kinetically driven in solution slowly form more stable complexes governed by thermodynamic equilibrium and observable in mature crystals.</p>

<p>α-L-arabinofuranosidases are glycoside hydrolases that specifically hydrolyze non-reducing residues from arabinose-containing polysaccharides. In the case of arabinoxylans, which are the main components of hemicellulose, they are part of microbial xylanolytic systems and are necessary for complete breakdown of arabinoxylans. Glycoside hydrolase family 62 (GH62) is currently a small family of α-L-arabinofuranosidases that contains only bacterial and fungal members. Little is known about the GH62 mechanism of action, because only a few members have been biochemically characterized and no three-dimensional structure is available. Here, we present the first crystal structures of two fungal GH62 α-L-arabinofuranosidases from the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis (UmAbf62A) and ascomycete Podospora anserina (PaAbf62A). Both enzymes are able to efficiently remove the α-L-arabinosyl substituents from arabinoxylan. The overall three-dimensional structure of UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A reveals a five-bladed β-propeller fold that confirms their predicted classification into clan GH-F together with GH43 α-L-arabinofuranosidases. Crystallographic structures of the complexes with arabinose and cellotriose reveal the important role of subsites +1 and +2 for sugar binding. Intriguingly, we observed that PaAbf62A was inhibited by cello-oligosaccharides and displayed binding affinity to cellulose although no activity was observed on a range of cellulosic substrates. Bioinformatic analyses showed that UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A belong to two distinct subfamilies within the GH62 family. The results presented here provide a framework to better investigate the structure-function relationships within the GH62 family.</p>

<p>Pathogenic protozoa such as Trypanosome and Leishmania species cause tremendous suffering worldwide. Because of their dependence on glycolysis for energy, the glycolytic enzymes of these organisms, including glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), are considered attractive drug targets. Using the adenine part of NAD as a lead compound, several 2,6-disubstituted purines were synthesized as inhibitors of Leishmania mexicana GPDH (LmGPDH). The electron densities for the inhibitor 2-bromo-6-chloro-purine bound to LmGPDH using a "conventional" wavelength around 1 A displayed a quasisymmetric shape. The anomalous signals from data collected at 1.77 A clearly indicated the positions of the halogen atoms and revealed the multiple binding modes of this inhibitor. Intriguing differences in the observed binding modes of the inhibitor between very similarly prepared crystals illustrate the possibility of crystal-to-crystal variations in protein-ligand complex structures.</p>

<p>Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) belonging to three nonhomologous classes (II, III, and IV) have been structurally characterized, enabling a comparison of the mechanisms of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate biosynthesis. We report the crystal structures of three active-site complexes for Yersinia pestis class IV AC (AC-IV)-two with substrate analogs and one with product. Mn(2+) binds to all three phosphates, and to Glu12 and Glu136. Electropositive residues Lys14, Arg63, Lys76, Lys111, and Arg113 also form hydrogen bonds to phosphates. The conformation of the analogs is suitable for in-line nucleophilic attack by the ribose O3' on α-phosphate (distance ∼4 Å). In the product complex, a second Mn ion is observed to be coordinated to both ribose 2' oxygen and ribose 3' oxygen. Observation of both metal sites, together with kinetic measurements, provides strong support for a two-cation mechanism. Eleven active-site mutants were also made and kinetically characterized. These findings and comparisons with class II and class III enzymes enable a detailed transphyletic analysis of the AC mechanism. Consistent with its lack of coordination to purine, Y. pestis AC-IV cyclizes both ATP and GTP. As in other classes of AC, the ribose is loosely bound, and as in class III, no base appears to ionize the O3' nucleophile. Different syn/anti conformations suggest that the mechanism involves a conformational transition, and further evidence suggests a role for ribosyl pseudorotation. With resolutions of 1.6-1.7 Å, these are the most detailed active-site ligand complexes for any class of this ubiquitous signaling enzyme.</p>

<p>Xenobiotic reductase A (XenA) from Pseudomonas putida 86 catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of various α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and is a member of the old yellow enzyme family. The reaction of XenA follows a ping-pong mechanism, implying that its active site has to accommodate and correctly position the various substrates to be oxidized (NADH/NADPH) and to be reduced (different α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds) to enable formal hydride transfers between the substrate and the isoalloxazine ring. The active site of XenA is lined by two tyrosine (Tyr27, Tyr183) and two tryptophan (Trp302, Trp358) residues, which were proposed to contribute to substrate binding. We analyzed the individual contributions of the four residues, using site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state and transient kinetics, redox potentiometry and crystal structure analysis. The Y183F substitution decreases the affinity of XenA for NADPH and reduces the rate of the oxidative half-reaction by two to three orders of magnitude, the latter being in agreement with its function as a proton donor in the oxidative half-reaction. Upon reduction of the flavin, Trp302 swings into the active site of XenA (in-conformation) and decreases the extent of the substrate-binding pocket. Its exchange against alanine induces substrate inhibition at elevated NADPH concentrations, indicating that the in-conformation of Trp302 helps to disfavor the nonproductive NADPH binding in the reduced state of XenA. Our analysis shows that while the principal catalytic mechanism of XenA, for example, type of proton donor, is analogous to that of other members of the old yellow enzyme family, its strategy to correctly position and accommodate different substrates is unprecedented.</p>

<p>The X-ray crystal structure of the flavoenzyme cholesterol oxidase, SCOA (Streptomyces sp.SA-COO) has been determined to 0.95 A resolution. The large size (55kDa) and the high-resolution diffraction of this protein provides a unique opportunity to observe detailed electronic effects within a protein environment and to obtain a larger sampling for which to analyze these electronic and structural differences. It is well-known through spectroscopic methods that peptide carbonyl groups are polarized in alpha-helices. This electronic characteristic is evident in the sub-Angstrom electron density of SCOA. Our analysis indicates an increased tendency for the electron density of the main chain carbonyl groups within alpha-helices to be polarized toward the oxygen atoms. In contrast, the carbonyl groups in beta-sheet structures tend to exhibit a greater charge density between the carbon and oxygen atoms. Interestingly, the electronic differences observed at the carbonyl groups do not appear to be correlated to the bond distance of the peptide bond or the peptide planarity. This study gives important insight into the electronic effects of alpha-helix dipoles in enzymes and provides experimentally based observations that have not been previously characterized in protein structure.</p>

<p>Here we report a highly conserved new binding site located at the interface between the protease and helicase domains of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protein. Using a chemical lead, identified by fragment screening and structure-guided design, we demonstrate that this site has a regulatory function on the protease activity via an allosteric mechanism. We propose that compounds binding at this allosteric site inhibit the function of the NS3 protein by stabilizing an inactive conformation and thus represent a new class of direct-acting antiviral agents.</p>

<p>DEAD-box RNA helicases play various, often critical, roles in all processes where RNAs are involved. Members of this family of proteins are linked to human disease, including cancer and viral infections. DEAD-box proteins contain two conserved domains that both contribute to RNA and ATP binding. Despite recent advances the molecular details of how these enzymes convert chemical energy into RNA remodeling is unknown. We present crystal structures of the isolated DEAD-domains of human DDX2A/eIF4A1, DDX2B/eIF4A2, DDX5, DDX10/DBP4, DDX18/myc-regulated DEAD-box protein, DDX20, DDX47, DDX52/ROK1, and DDX53/CAGE, and of the helicase domains of DDX25 and DDX41. Together with prior knowledge this enables a family-wide comparative structural analysis. We propose a general mechanism for opening of the RNA binding site. This analysis also provides insights into the diversity of DExD/H- proteins, with implications for understanding the functions of individual family members.</p>

<p>The chemical properties of zinc make it an ideal metal to study the role of coordination strain in enzymatic rate enhancement. The zinc ion and the protein residues that are bound directly to the zinc ion represent a functional charge/dipole complex, and polarization of this complex, which translates to coordination distortion, may tune electrophilicity, and hence, reactivity. Conserved protein residues outside of the charge/dipole complex, such as second-shell residues, may play a role in supporting the electronic strain produced as a consequence of functional polarization. To test the correlation between charge/dipole polarity and ligand binding affinity, structure-function studies were carried out on the dizinc aminopeptidase from Vibrio proteolyticus. Alanine substitutions of S228 and M180 resulted in catalytically diminished enzymes whose crystal structures show very little change in the positions of the metal ions and the protein residues. However, more detailed inspections of the crystal structures show small positional changes that account for differences in the zinc ion coordination geometry. Measurements of the binding affinity of leucine phosphonic acid, a transition state analogue, and leucine, a product, show a correlation between coordination geometry and ligand binding affinity. These results suggest that the coordination number and polarity may tune the electrophilicity of zinc. This may have provided the evolving enzyme with the ability to discriminate between reaction coordinate species.</p>

<p>The successful development of a number of HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors for the treatment of AIDS has validated the utilization of retroviral PRs as drug targets and necessitated their detailed structural study. Here we report the structure of a complex of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) PR with a substrate-based inhibitor bound in subsites P5 through P5'. Although HTLV-1 PR exhibits an overall fold similar to other retroviral PRs, significant structural differences are present in several loop areas, which include the functionally important flaps, previously considered to be structurally highly conserved. Potential key residues responsible for the resistance of HTLV-1 PR to anti-HIV drugs are identified. We expect that the knowledge accumulated during the development of anti-HIV drugs, particularly in overcoming drug resistance, will help in designing a novel class of antileukemia drugs targeting HTLV-1 PR and in predicting their drug-resistance profile. The structure presented here can be used as a starting point for the development of such anticancer therapies.</p>

<p>The shikimate pathway, responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, is essential for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a potential target for the design of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. The first step of this pathway is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). The DAH7PSs have been classified into two apparently unrelated types and, whereas structural data have been obtained for the type I DAH7PSs, no structural information is available for their type II counterparts. The type II DAH7PS from M.tuberculosis has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, functionally characterized and crystallized. It is found to be metal ion-dependent and subject to feedback inhibition by phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine and chorismate, with a significant synergistic effect when tryptophan is used in combination with phenylalanine. The crystal structure of M.tuberculosis DAH7PS has been determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and refined at 2.3A in complex with substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and Mn(2+). The structure reveals a tightly associated dimer of (beta/alpha)(8) TIM barrels. The monomer fold, the arrangement of key residues in the active site, and the binding modes of PEP and Mn(2+), all match those of the type I enzymes, and indicate a common ancestry for the type I and type II DAH7PSs, despite their minimal sequence identity. In contrast, the structural elements that decorate the core (beta/alpha)(8) fold differ from those in the type I enzymes, consistent with their different regulatory and oligomeric properties.</p>

<p>Determining the chemical and structural modifications occurring within a protein during fundamental processes such as ligand or substrate binding is essential to building up a complete picture of biological function. Currently, significant unanswered questions relate to the way in which protein structural dynamics fit within the structure-function relationship and to the functional role, if any, of bound water molecules in the active site. Addressing these questions requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary experimental techniques that, in combination, enhance our understanding of the complexities of protein chemistry. We exemplify this philosophy by applying both physical and biological approaches to investigate the active site chemistry that contributes to the inhibition of the Corynebacterium glutamicum catalase enzyme by nitric oxide. Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) experiments exploit the NO ligand as a local probe of the active site molecular environment and shows that catalase displays a dynamically-restricted, 'tight,' structure. X-ray crystallography studies of C. glutamicum catalase confirm the presence of a conserved chain of hydrogen-bonded bound water molecules that link the NO ligand and the protein scaffold. This combination of bound water and restricted dynamics stands in stark contrast to other haem proteins, such as myoglobin, that exhibit ligand transport functionality despite the presence of a similar distal architecture in close proximity to the ligand. We conclude not only that the bound water molecules in the catalase active site play an important role in molecular recognition of NO but also may be part of the mechanistic operation of this important enzyme. </p>

<p>HIV-1 protease (PR) is the target for several important antiviral drugs used in AIDS therapy. The drugs bind inside the active site cavity of PR where normally the viral polyprotein substrate is bound and hydrolyzed. We report two high-resolution crystal structures of wild-type PR (PRWT) and the multi-drug-resistant variant with the I54V mutation (PRI54V) in complex with a peptide at 1.46 and 1.50 A resolution, respectively. The peptide forms a gem-diol tetrahedral reaction intermediate (TI) in the crystal structures. Distinctive interactions are observed for the TI binding in the active site cavity of PRWT and PRI54V. The mutant PRI54V/TI complex has lost water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions with the amides of Ile50 and Ile50' in the flap. Hence, the structures provide insight into the mechanism of drug resistance arising from this mutation. The structures also illustrate an intermediate state in the hydrolysis reaction. One of the gem-diol hydroxide groups in the PRWT complex forms a very short (2.3 A) hydrogen bond with the outer carboxylate oxygen of Asp25. Quantum chemical calculations based on this TI structure are consistent with protonation of the inner carboxylate oxygen of Asp25', in contrast to several theoretical studies. These TI complexes and quantum calculations are discussed in relation to the chemical mechanism of the peptide bond hydrolysis catalyzed by PR.</p>

<p>3-Deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) catalyzes the reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate and arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) in the first committed step in the pathway to 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate, a component in the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. KDO8PS is evolutionarily and structurally related to the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS), which uses erythrose 4-phosphate in place of A5P. Both KDO8PS and type Iβ DAH7PS enzymes adopt similar homotetrameric associations with their active sites close to one of the interfaces. The conserved PAFLxR motif in KDO8PS and the corresponding GARNxQ motif in type Iβ DAH7PS, both on the short β4-α4 loop of the (β/α)8 barrel, form part of this interface and provide key contacts with substrates. This (112)PAFLxR(117) motif was mutated in Neisseria meningitidis KDO8PS in order to assess its role in enzyme function. Arg117 extends across the interface to provide guanidinium functionality in the A5P binding site of the adjacent subunit. Substitution Arg117Ala severely hampered catalysis, whereas substitution to Lys was tolerated better. Mutation of Phe114 to either Arg or Ala results in active proteins, but with substantially elevated Km(A5P) values. Mutant proteins that combine substitutions in this motif demonstrate poor catalytic function, and, although these mutated residues now structurally resemble their counterparts in the GARNxQ motif of type Iβ DAH7PS, no DAH7PS-like activity was observed. Analysis of the structures reveals that small changes in relative orientation of the subunits are important for the differences in active-site construction. Quaternary structure is therefore tightly linked to substrate specificity. </p>

<p>Carbonic anhydrase has been well studied structurally and functionally owing to its importance in respiration. A large number of X-ray crystallographic structures of carbonic anhydrase and its inhibitor complexes have been determined, some at atomic resolution. Structure determination of a sulfonamide-containing inhibitor complex has been carried out and the structure was refined at 0.9 A resolution with anisotropic atomic displacement parameters to an R value of 0.141. The structure is similar to those of other carbonic anhydrase complexes, with the inhibitor providing a fourth nonprotein ligand to the active-site zinc. Comparison of this structure with 13 other atomic resolution (higher than 1.25 A) isomorphous carbonic anhydrase structures provides a view of the structural similarity and variability in a series of crystal structures. At the center of the protein the structures superpose very well. The metal complexes superpose (with only two exceptions) with standard deviations of 0.01 A in some zinc-protein and zinc-ligand bond lengths. In contrast, regions of structural variability are found on the protein surface, possibly owing to flexibility and disorder in the individual structures, differences in the chemical and crystalline environments or the different approaches used by different investigators to model weak or complicated electron-density maps. These findings suggest that care must be taken in interpreting structural details on protein surfaces on the basis of individual X-ray structures, even if atomic resolution data are available.</p>

<p>Organophosphorus insecticides and nerve agents inhibit the vital enzyme acetylcholinesterase by covalently bonding to the catalytic serine residue of the enzyme. Oxime-based reactivators, such as [(E)-[1-[(4-carbamoylpyridin-1-ium-1-yl)methoxymethyl]pyridin-2-ylidene]methyl]-oxoazanium dichloride (HI-6) and 1,7-heptylene-bis-N,N'-2-pyridiniumaldoxime dichloride (Ortho-7), restore the organophosphate-inhibited enzymatic activity by cleaving the phosphorous conjugate. In this article, we report the intermolecular interactions between Mus musculus acetylcholinesterase inhibited by the insecticide fenamiphos (fep-mAChE) and HI-6 or Ortho-7 revealed by a combination of crystallography and kinetics. The crystal structures of the two oxime-bound fep-mAChE complexes show that both oximes interact with the peripheral anionic site involving different conformations of Trp286 and different peripheral-site residues (Tyr124 for HI-6 and Tyr72 for Ortho-7). Moreover, residues at catalytic site of the HI-6-bound fep-mAChE complex adopt conformations that are similar to those in the apo mAChE, whereas significant conformational changes are observed for the corresponding residues in the Ortho-7-bound fep-mAChE complex. Interestingly, flipping of the His447 imidazole ring allows the formation of a hydrogen bonding network among the Glu334-His447-Ortho-7 triad, which presumably deprotonates the Ortho-7 oxime hydroxyl group, increases the nucleophilicity of the oxime group, and leads to cleavage of the phosphorous conjugate. These results offer insights into a detailed reactivation mechanism for the oximes and development of improved reactivators.</p>

<p>α-L-arabinofuranosidases are glycoside hydrolases that specifically hydrolyze non-reducing residues from arabinose-containing polysaccharides. In the case of arabinoxylans, which are the main components of hemicellulose, they are part of microbial xylanolytic systems and are necessary for complete breakdown of arabinoxylans. Glycoside hydrolase family 62 (GH62) is currently a small family of α-L-arabinofuranosidases that contains only bacterial and fungal members. Little is known about the GH62 mechanism of action, because only a few members have been biochemically characterized and no three-dimensional structure is available. Here, we present the first crystal structures of two fungal GH62 α-L-arabinofuranosidases from the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis (UmAbf62A) and ascomycete Podospora anserina (PaAbf62A). Both enzymes are able to efficiently remove the α-L-arabinosyl substituents from arabinoxylan. The overall three-dimensional structure of UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A reveals a five-bladed β-propeller fold that confirms their predicted classification into clan GH-F together with GH43 α-L-arabinofuranosidases. Crystallographic structures of the complexes with arabinose and cellotriose reveal the important role of subsites +1 and +2 for sugar binding. Intriguingly, we observed that PaAbf62A was inhibited by cello-oligosaccharides and displayed binding affinity to cellulose although no activity was observed on a range of cellulosic substrates. Bioinformatic analyses showed that UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A belong to two distinct subfamilies within the GH62 family. The results presented here provide a framework to better investigate the structure-function relationships within the GH62 family.</p>

<p>α-L-arabinofuranosidases are glycoside hydrolases that specifically hydrolyze non-reducing residues from arabinose-containing polysaccharides. In the case of arabinoxylans, which are the main components of hemicellulose, they are part of microbial xylanolytic systems and are necessary for complete breakdown of arabinoxylans. Glycoside hydrolase family 62 (GH62) is currently a small family of α-L-arabinofuranosidases that contains only bacterial and fungal members. Little is known about the GH62 mechanism of action, because only a few members have been biochemically characterized and no three-dimensional structure is available. Here, we present the first crystal structures of two fungal GH62 α-L-arabinofuranosidases from the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis (UmAbf62A) and ascomycete Podospora anserina (PaAbf62A). Both enzymes are able to efficiently remove the α-L-arabinosyl substituents from arabinoxylan. The overall three-dimensional structure of UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A reveals a five-bladed β-propeller fold that confirms their predicted classification into clan GH-F together with GH43 α-L-arabinofuranosidases. Crystallographic structures of the complexes with arabinose and cellotriose reveal the important role of subsites +1 and +2 for sugar binding. Intriguingly, we observed that PaAbf62A was inhibited by cello-oligosaccharides and displayed binding affinity to cellulose although no activity was observed on a range of cellulosic substrates. Bioinformatic analyses showed that UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A belong to two distinct subfamilies within the GH62 family.

<p>We report here the first crystal structure of a stable isosteric analogue of 1,3-bisphospho-d-glyceric acid (1,3-BPGA) bound to the catalytic domain of Trypanosoma cruzi glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) in which the two phosphoryl moieties interact with Arg249. This complex possibly illustrates a step of the catalytic process by which Arg249 may induce compression of the product formed, allowing its expulsion from the active site. Structural modifications were introduced into this isosteric analogue and the respective inhibitory effects of the resulting diphosphorylated compounds on T. cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei gGAPDHs were investigated by enzymatic inhibition studies, fluorescence spectroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular modelling. Despite the high homology between the two trypanomastid gGAPDHs (&gt; 95%), we have identified specific interactions that could be used to design selective irreversible inhibitors against T. cruzi gGAPDH.</p>

<p>The family 38 golgi alpha-mannosidase II, thought to cleave mannosidic bonds through a double displacement mechanism involving a reaction intermediate, is a clinically important enzyme involved in glycoprotein processing. The structure of three different covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediates have been determined to 1.2-A resolution for the Golgi alpha-mannosidase II from Drosophila melanogaster by use of fluorinated sugar analogues, both with the wild-type enzyme and a mutant enzyme in which the acid/base catalyst has been removed. All these structures reveal sugar intermediates bound in a distorted 1S5 skew boat conformation. The similarity of this conformation with that of the substrate in the recently determined structure of the Michaelis complex of a beta-mannanase (Ducros, V. M. A., Zechel, D. L., Murshudov, G. N., Gilbert, H. J., Szabo, L., Stoll, D., Withers, S. G., and Davies, G. J. (2002) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 41, 2824-2827) suggests that these disparate enzymes have recruited common stereoelectronic features in evolving their catalytic mechanisms.</p>

<p>We present results of combined studies of the enzyme human aldose reductase (h-AR, 36 kDa) using single-crystal x-ray data (0.66 A, 100K; 0.80 A, 15K; 1.75 A, 293K), neutron Laue data (2.2 A, 293K), and quantum mechanical modeling. These complementary techniques unveil the internal organization and mobility of the hydrogen bond network that defines the properties of the catalytic engine, explaining how this promiscuous enzyme overcomes the simultaneous requirements of efficiency and promiscuity offering a general mechanistic view for this class of enzymes.</p>

<p>Methemoglobinemia, the first hereditary disease to be identified that involved an enzyme deficiency, has been ascribed to mutations in the enzyme cytochrome b(5) reductase. A variety of defects in either the erythrocytic or microsomal forms of the enzyme have been identified that give rise to the type I or type II variant of the disease, respectively. The positions of the methemoglobinemia-causing mutations are scattered throughout the protein sequence, but the majority of the nontruncated mutants that produce type II symptoms occur close to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor binding site. While X-ray structures have been determined for the soluble, flavin-containing diaphorase domains of the rat and pig enzymes, no X-ray or NMR structure has been described for the human enzyme or any of the methemoglobinemia variants. S127P, a mutant that causes type II methemoglobinemia, was the first to be positively identified and have its spectroscopic and kinetic properties characterized that revealed altered nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH) substrate binding behavior. To understand these changes at a structural level, we have determined the structure of the S127P mutant of rat cytochrome b(5) reductase to 1.8 A resolution, providing the first structural snapshot of a cytochrome b(5) reductase mutant that causes methemoglobinemia. The high-resolution structure revealed that the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) moiety of the FAD prosthetic group is displaced into the corresponding ADP binding site of the physiological substrate, NADH, thus acting as a substrate inhibitor which is consistent with both the spectroscopic and kinetic data.</p>

<p>Dethiobiotin synthetase (DTBS) is involved in the biosynthesis of biotin in bacteria, fungi, and plants. As humans lack this pathway, DTBS is a promising antimicrobial drug target. We determined structures of DTBS from Helicobacter pylori (hpDTBS) bound with cofactors and a substrate analog, and described its unique characteristics relative to other DTBS proteins. Comparison with bacterial DTBS orthologs revealed considerable structural differences in nucleotide recognition. The C-terminal region of DTBS proteins, which contains two nucleotide-recognition motifs, differs greatly among DTBS proteins from different species. The structure of hpDTBS revealed that this protein is unique and does not contain a C-terminal region containing one of the motifs. The single nucleotide-binding motif in hpDTBS is similar to its counterpart in GTPases; however, isothermal titration calorimetry binding studies showed that hpDTBS has a strong preference for ATP. The structural determinants of ATP specificity were assessed with X-ray crystallographic studies of hpDTBS·ATP and hpDTBS·GTP complexes. The unique mode of nucleotide recognition in hpDTBS makes this protein a good target for H. pylori-specific inhibitors of the biotin synthesis pathway.</p>

<p>UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM) is a flavin-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of UDP-galactopyranose (UDP-Galp) to UDP-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf). As in prokaryotic UGMs, the flavin needs to be reduced for the enzyme to be active. Here we present the first eukaryotic UGM structures from Aspergillus fumigatus (AfUGM). The structures are of UGM alone, with the substrate UDP-Galp and with the inhibitor UDP. Additionally, we report the structures of AfUGM bound to substrate with oxidized and reduced flavin. These structures provide insight into substrate recognition and structural changes observed upon substrate binding involving the mobile loops and the critical arginine residues Arg-182 and Arg-327. Comparison with prokaryotic UGM reveals that despite low sequence identity with known prokaryotic UGMs the overall fold is largely conserved. Structural differences between prokaryotic UGM and AfUGM result from inserts in AfUGM. A notable difference from prokaryotic UGMs is that AfUGM contains a third flexible loop (loop III) above the si-face of the isoalloxazine ring that changes position depending on the redox state of the flavin cofactor. This loop flipping has not been observed in prokaryotic UGMs. In addition we have determined the crystals structures and steady-state kinetic constants of the reaction catalyzed by mutants R182K, R327K, R182A, and R327A. These results support our hypothesis that Arg-182 and Arg-327 play important roles in stabilizing the position of the diphosphates of the nucleotide sugar and help to facilitate the positioning of the galactose moiety for catalysis.</p>

<p>Linear 2-alkylaminoethyl-1,1-bisphosphonates are effective agents against proliferation of  Trypanosoma cruzi , the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), exhibiting IC(50) values in the nanomolar range against the parasites. This activity is associated with inhibition at the low nanomolar level of the  T. cruzi  farnesyl diphosphate synthase (TcFPPS). X-ray structures and thermodynamic data of the complexes TcFPPS with five compounds of this family show that the inhibitors bind to the allylic site of the enzyme, with their alkyl chain occupying the cavity that binds the isoprenoid chain of the substrate. The compounds bind to TcFPPS with unfavorable enthalpy compensated by a favorable entropy that results from a delicate balance between two opposing effects: the loss of conformational entropy due to freezing of single bond rotations and the favorable burial of the hydrophobic alkyl chains. The data suggest that introduction of strategically placed double bonds and methyl branches should increase affinity substantially.</p>

<p>Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.</p>

<p>AnsA is the cytoplasmic asparaginase from Escherichia coli involved in intracellular asparagine utilization. Analytical ultracentifugation and X-ray crystallography reveal that AnsA forms a tetrameric structure as a dimer of two intimate dimers. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme reveals that AnsA is positively cooperative, displaying a sigmoidal substrate dependence curve with an [S](0.5) of 1 mM L-asparagine and a Hill coefficient (n(H)) of 2.6. Binding of L-asparagine to an allosteric site was observed in the crystal structure concomitant with a reorganization of the quarternary structure, relative to the apo enzyme. The carboxyl group of the bound asparagine makes salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to Arg240, while the N(delta2) nitrogen interacts with Thr162. Mutation of Arg240 to Ala increases the [S](0.5) value to 5.9 mM, presumably by reducing the affinity of the site for L-asparagine, although the enzyme retains cooperativity. Mutation of Thr162 to Ala results in an active enzyme with no cooperativity. Transmission of the signal from the allosteric site to the active site appears to involve subtle interactions at the dimer-dimer interface and relocation of Gln118 into the vicinity of the active site to position the probable catalytic water molecule. These data define the structural basis for the cooperative regulation of the intracellular asparaginase that is required for proper functioning within the cell.</p>

<p>Flexibility is a common feature of proteins. For human aldose reductase, a variety of conformers have been observed in crystalline complexes with different inhibitors.</p>

<p>Flavin mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (FMNAT) catalyzes the formation of the essential flavocoenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and plays an important role in flavocoenzyme homeostasis regulation. By sequence comparison, bacterial and eukaryotic FMNAT enzymes belong to two different protein superfamilies and apparently utilize different sets of active-site residues to accomplish the same chemistry. Here we report the first structural characterization of a eukaryotic FMNAT from the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata. Four crystal structures of C. glabrata FMNAT in different complexed forms were determined at 1.20-1.95 A resolutions, capturing the enzyme active-site states prior to and after catalysis. These structures reveal a novel flavin-binding mode and a unique enzyme-bound FAD conformation. Comparison of the bacterial and eukaryotic FMNATs provides a structural basis for understanding the convergent evolution of the same FMNAT activity from different protein ancestors. Structure-based investigation of the kinetic properties of FMNAT should offer insights into the regulatory mechanisms of FAD homeostasis by FMNAT in eukaryotic organisms.</p>

<p>Phytochromes are red-light photoreceptors that regulate light responses in plants, fungi, and bacteria by means of reversible photoconversion between red (Pr) and far-red (Pfr) light-absorbing states. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Q188L mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome (PaBphP) photosensory core module, which exhibits altered photoconversion behavior and different crystal packing from wild type. We observe two distinct chromophore conformations in the Q188L crystal structure that we identify with the Pfr and Pr states. The Pr/Pfr compositions, varying from crystal to crystal, seem to correlate with light conditions under which the Q188L crystals are cryoprotected. We also compare all known Pr and Pfr structures. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identify residues that are involved in stabilizing the 15Ea (Pfr) and 15Za (Pr) configurations of the biliverdin chromophore. Specifically, Ser-261 appears to be essential to form a stable Pr state in PaBphP, possibly by means of its interaction with the propionate group of ring C. We propose a "flip-and-rotate" model that summarizes the major conformational differences between the Pr and Pfr states of the chromophore and its binding pocket.</p>

<p>TNFalpha converting enzyme (TACE) is the major metalloproteinase for the processing of TNFalpha, a key inflammatory cytokine. IK682, a hydroxamate compound, was reported to be a potent and specific TACE inhibitor [J.J. Duan, L. Chen, Z.R. Wasserman, Z. Lu, R.Q. Liu, M.B. Covington, M. Qian, K.D. Hardman, R.L. Magolda, R.C. Newton, D.D. Christ, R.R. Wexler, C.P. Decicco, J. Med. Chem. 45 (2002) 4954-4957]. The binding kinetics of IK682 and the ectodomain of human TACE was examined. The k(on) of IK682 was determined as 1.1+/-0.3 x 10(8) M(-1) min(-1). No detectable dissociation of IK682 from TACE was observed following dialysis, dilution, and extensive washing over a maximum of 72 h. This was in contrast to the rapid dissociation of IK682 from ADAM10. LC/MS analysis of the TACE-IK682 complex after dissociation under denaturing conditions indicated that the tight binding is not due to covalent interaction. The X-ray crystal structure of TACE-IK682 complex revealed multiple binding points at the S1' and S3' sites and the movement of a loop (from Ala349 to Gly442) to accommodate the binding of the quinolinyl group of IK682 at the S3' pocket. The conformational changes of TACE may contribute significantly to the high affinity binding as a result of a more stable TACE-inhibitor complex.</p>

<p>Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline through the intermediate N(ω)-hydroxy-L-arginine (NHA), producing nitric oxide, an important mammalian signaling molecule. Several disease states are associated with improper regulation of nitric oxide production, making NOS a therapeutic target. The first step of the NOS reaction has been well-characterized and is presumed to proceed through a compound I heme species, analogous to the cytochrome P450 mechanism. The second step, however, is enzymatically unprecedented and is thought to occur via a ferric peroxo heme species. To gain insight into the details of this unique second step, we report here the synthesis of NHA analogues bearing guanidinium methyl or ethyl substitutions and their investigation as either inhibitors of or alternate substrates for NOS. Radiolabeling studies reveal that N(ω)-methoxy-L-arginine, an alternative NOS substrate, produces citrulline, nitric oxide, and methanol. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanism for the second step of NOS catalysis in which a methylated nitric oxide species is released and is further metabolized by NOS. Crystal structures of our NHA analogues bound to nNOS have been determined, revealing the presence of an active site water molecule only in the presence of singly methylated analogues. Bulkier analogues displace this active site water molecule; a different mechanism is proposed in the absence of the water molecule. Our results provide new insights into the steric and stereochemical tolerance of the NOS active site and substrate capabilities of NOS.</p>

<p>Bacterial enzymes of the menaquinone (Vitamin K2) pathway are potential drug targets because they lack human homologs. MenB, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA synthase, the fourth enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway leading from chorismate to menaquinone, catalyzes the conversion of O-succinylbenzoyl-CoA (OSB-CoA) to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA (DHNA-CoA). Based on our interest in developing novel tuberculosis chemotherapeutics, we have solved the structures of MenB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its complex with acetoacetyl-coenzyme A at 1.8 and 2.3 A resolution, respectively. Like other members of the crotonase superfamily, MenB folds as an (alpha3)2 hexamer, but its fold is distinct in that the C terminus crosses the trimer-trimer interface, forming a flexible part of the active site within the opposing trimer. The highly conserved active site of MenB contains a deep pocket lined by Asp-192, Tyr-287, and hydrophobic residues. Mutagenesis shows that Asp-192 and Tyr-287 are essential for enzymatic catalysis. We postulate a catalytic mechanism in which MenB enables proton transfer within the substrate to yield an oxyanion as the initial step in catalysis. Knowledge of the active site geometry and characterization of the catalytic mechanism of MenB will aid in identifying new inhibitors for this potential drug target.</p>

<p>Thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes are involved in a wide variety of metabolic pathways. The molecular mechanism behind active site communication and substrate activation, observed in some of these enzymes, has since long been an area of debate. Here, we report the crystal structures of a phenylpyruvate decarboxylase in complex with its substrates and a covalent reaction intermediate analogue. These structures reveal the regulatory site and unveil the mechanism of allosteric substrate activation. This signal transduction relies on quaternary structure reorganizations, domain rotations, and a pathway of local conformational changes that are relayed from the regulatory site to the active site. The current findings thus uncover the molecular mechanism by which the binding of a substrate in the regulatory site is linked to the mounting of the catalytic machinery in the active site in this thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme.</p>

<p>X-ray crystallography typically uses a single set of coordinates and B factors to describe macromolecular conformations. Refinement of multiple copies of the entire structure has been previously used in specific cases as an alternative means of representing structural flexibility. Here, we systematically validate this method by using simulated diffraction data, and we find that ensemble refinement produces better representations of the distributions of atomic positions in the simulated structures than single-conformer refinements. Comparison of principal components calculated from the refined ensembles and simulations shows that concerted motions are captured locally, but that correlations dissipate over long distances. Ensemble refinement is also used on 50 experimental structures of varying resolution and leads to decreases in R(free) values, implying that improvements in the representation of flexibility observed for the simulated structures may apply to real structures. These gains are essentially independent of resolution or data-to-parameter ratio, suggesting that even structures at moderate resolution can benefit from ensemble refinement.</p>

<p>We have obtained the three-dimensional X-ray crystallographic structure of a C67A mutant Escherichia coli isopentenylpyrophosphate-dimethylallylpyrophosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.3.2) complexed with the bromohydrin of isopentenylpyrophosphate, at 1.93 A resolution. The overall backbone fold is very similar to that obtained previously for the wild-type enzyme in the presence of a divalent metal cation (Mn2+ or Mg2+). However, in the new structure, there are two metal binding sites, not just one. The first metal binding site is occupied by Mn2+, coordinated to three histidine and two glutamate residues, while the second is occupied by Mg2+, coordinated to two bromohydrin-ligand phosphate oxygens, the carbonyl oxygen of A67, a carboxyl oxygen of E87, and two water molecules. The C3 hydroxyl group of the bromohydrin inhibitor is involved in a short hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group of E116, one of the two Mn-bound glutamates. The structure obtained is consistent with a mechanism of action of the enzyme in which the carboxyl group of E116 protonates the double bond in isopentenylpyrophosphate, forming a carbocation, followed by removal of a C2 proton by the thiolate of C67, in the wild-type enzyme. The inhibition of the enzyme by a wide variety of other potent inhibitors is also readily explained on the basis of the bromohydrin inhibitor structure.</p>

<p>The compound UIC-94017 (TMC-114) is a second-generation HIV protease inhibitor with improved pharmacokinetics that is chemically related to the clinical inhibitor amprenavir. UIC-94017 is a broad-spectrum potent inhibitor active against HIV-1 clinical isolates with minimal cytotoxicity. We have determined the high-resolution crystal structures of UIC-94017 in complexes with wild-type HIV-1 protease (PR) and mutant proteases PR(V82A) and PR(I84V) that are common in drug-resistant HIV. The structures were refined at resolutions of 1.10-1.53A. The crystal structures of PR and PR(I84V) with UIC-94017 ternary complexes show that the inhibitor binds to the protease in two overlapping positions, while the PR(V82A) complex had one ordered inhibitor. In all three structures, UIC-94017 forms hydrogen bonds with the conserved main-chain atoms of Asp29 and Asp30 of the protease. These interactions are proposed to be critical for the potency of this compound against HIV isolates that are resistant to multiple protease inhibitors. Other small differences were observed in the interactions of the mutants with UIC-94017 as compared to PR. PR(V82A) showed differences in the position of the main-chain atoms of residue 82 compared to PR structure that better accommodated the inhibitor. Finally, the 1.10A resolution structure of PR(V82A) with UIC-94017 showed an unusual distribution of electron density for the catalytic aspartate residues, which is discussed in relation to the reaction mechanism.</p>

<p>Mammalian cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) is a mononuclear non-heme iron protein that catalyzes the conversion of cysteine (Cys) to cysteine sulfinic acid by an unclarified mechanism. One structural study revealed that a Cys-persulfenate (or Cys-persulfenic acid) formed in the active site, but quantum mechanical calculations have been used to support arguments that it is not an energetically feasible reaction intermediate. Here, we report a series of high-resolution structures of CDO soaked with Cys at pH values from 4 to 9. Cys binding is minimal at pH≤5 and persulfenate formation is consistently seen at pH values between 5.5 and 7. Also, a structure determined using laboratory-based X-ray diffraction shows that the persulfenate, with an apparent average O-O separation distance of ~1.8Å, is not an artifact of synchrotron radiation. At pH≥8, the active-site iron shifts from 4- to 5-coordinate, and Cys soaks reveal a complex with Cys, but no dioxygen, bound. This 'Cys-only' complex differs in detail from a previously published 'Cys-only' complex, which we reevaluate and conclude is not reliable. The high-resolution structures presented here do not resolve the CDO mechanism but do imply that an iron-bound persulfenate (or persulfenic acid) is energetically accessible in the CDO active site, and that CDO active-site chemistry in the crystals is influenced by protonation/deprotonation events with effective pKa values near ~5.5 and ~7.5 that influence Cys binding and oxygen binding/reactivity, respectively. Furthermore, this work provides reliable ligand-bound models for guiding future mechanistic considerations. </p>

<p>LpxC is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of lipid A, a vital component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Accordingly, the inhibition of LpxC is an attractive strategy for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Here, we report the 2.7 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of LpxC from Aquifex aeolicus complexed with uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP), and the 3.1 A resolution structure of LpxC complexed with pyrophosphate. The X-ray crystal structure of the LpxC-UDP complex provides the first view of interactions likely to be exploited by the substrate UDP group in the "basic patch" of the active site. The diphosphate group of UDP makes hydrogen bond interactions with strictly conserved residue K239 as well as solvent molecules. The ribose moiety of UDP interacts with partially conserved residue E197. The UDP uracil group hydrogen bonds with both the backbone NH group and the backbone carbonyl group of E160, and with the backbone NH group of K162 through an intervening water molecule. Finally, the alpha-phosphate and uracil groups of UDP interact with R143 and R262 through intervening water molecules. The structure of LpxC complexed with pyrophosphate reveals generally similar intermolecular interactions in the basic patch. Unexpectedly, diphosphate binding in both complexes is accompanied by coordination to an additional zinc ion, resulting in the identification of a new metal-binding site termed the E-site. The structures of the LpxC-UDP and LpxC-pyrophosphate complexes provide new insights with regard to substrate recognition in the basic patch and metal ion coordination in the active site of LpxC.</p>

<p>Coumarins constitute a general and totally new class of inhibitors of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), binding at the entrance of the active site cavity. We report here that the coumarin-binding site in CAs may interact with diverse compounds, such as the antiepileptic drug lacosamide, which inhibits mammalian CAs I-XV, with inhibition constants in range of 331 nM to 4.56 microM. Its X-ray crystal structure in adduct with CA II reveals the molecular basis for this inhibition. Lacosamide was found in the coumarin-binding site, making favorable van der Waals interactions with Thr200, Asn67, Gln92, and Phe131. No interactions with the Zn(II) ion were evidenced in the CA II-lacosamide adduct. The coumarin-binding site may thus accommodate structurally diverse compounds which possess an inhibition mechanism distinct of that of sulfonamides. This finding opens new possibilities for designing CA inhibitors/activators with various biomedical applications.</p>

<p>The fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) is a potential target for anti-obesity medicines. FTO is a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent N-methyl nucleic acid demethylase that acts on substrates including 3-methylthymidine, 3-methyluracil, and 6-methyladenine. To identify FTO inhibitors, we screened a set of 2OG analogues and related compounds using differential scanning fluorometry- and liquid chromatography-based assays. The results revealed sets of both cyclic and acyclic 2OG analogues that are FTO inhibitors. Identified inhibitors include small molecules that have been used in clinical studies for the inhibition of other 2OG oxygenases. Crystallographic analyses reveal inhibition by 2OG cosubstrate or primary substrate competitors as well as compounds that bind across both cosubstrate and primary substrate binding sites. The results will aid the development of more potent and selective FTO inhibitors.</p>

<p>Mammalian cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) is a mononuclear non-heme iron protein that catalyzes the conversion of cysteine (Cys) to cysteine sulfinic acid by an unclarified mechanism. One structural study revealed that a Cys-persulfenate (or Cys-persulfenic acid) formed in the active site, but quantum mechanical calculations have been used to support arguments that it is not an energetically feasible reaction intermediate. Here, we report a series of high-resolution structures of CDO soaked with Cys at pH values from 4 to 9. Cys binding is minimal at pH≤5 and persulfenate formation is consistently seen at pH values between 5.5 and 7. Also, a structure determined using laboratory-based X-ray diffraction shows that the persulfenate, with an apparent average O-O separation distance of ~1.8Å, is not an artifact of synchrotron radiation. At pH≥8, the active-site iron shifts from 4- to 5-coordinate, and Cys soaks reveal a complex with Cys, but no dioxygen, bound. This 'Cys-only' complex differs in detail from a previously published 'Cys-only' complex, which we reevaluate and conclude is not reliable. The high-resolution structures presented here do not resolve the CDO mechanism but do imply that an iron-bound persulfenate (or persulfenic acid) is energetically accessible in the CDO active site, and that CDO active-site chemistry in the crystals is influenced by protonation/deprotonation events with effective pKa values near ~5.5 and ~7.5 that influence Cys binding and oxygen binding/reactivity, respectively. Furthermore, this work provides reliable ligand-bound models for guiding future mechanistic considerations. </p>

<p>Thiolactomycin inhibits bacterial cell growth through inhibition of the beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase activity of type II fatty acid synthases. The effect of modifications of the 5-position isoprenoid side chain on both IC(50) and MIC were determined. Synthesis and screening of a structurally diverse set of 5-position analogues revealed very little tolerance for substitution in purified enzyme assays, but a few analogues retained MIC, presumably through another target. Even subtle modifications such as reducing one or both double bonds of the diene were not tolerated. The only permissible structural modifications were removal of the isoprene methyl group or addition of a methyl group to the terminus. Cocrystallization of these two inhibitors with the condensing enzyme from Escherichia coli revealed that they retained the TLM binding mode at the active site with reduced affinity. These results suggest a strict requirement for a conjugated, planar side chain inserting within the condensing enzyme active site.</p>

<p>The structure of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase crystallized as a complex with Mg2+, K+, and L-phospholactate (L-P-lactate) has been solved and refined to 2.7 A resolution. The crystals, grown from solutions of polyethylene glycol 8000 at pH 7.5, belong to the space group P2(1) and have unit cell parameters a = 144.4 A, b = 112.6 A, c = 171.2 A, and beta = 93.7 degrees. The asymmetric unit contains two tetramers. The crystal structure reveals that the eight subunits within the asymmetric unit adopt several different conformations. These conformations are characterized by differences in the relative positions of protein domains A and B, resulting in different degrees of closure of the active site cleft that occupies the interface between these two domains. The global conformational differences may be described as rotations of the B domain with respect to the (beta/alpha)8-barrel of the A domain. Carbon atoms of the backbone in domain B rotate &gt;20 degrees from the most open to the most closed subunit. The different conformations among subunits within the asymmetric unit are accompanied by 3-3.8 A shifts in the position of Mg2+ and a significant change in the orientation of the phenyl ring of Phe 243. In all of the subunits, Mg2+ coordinates to the protein through the carboxylate side chains of Glu 271 and Asp 295. In the subunit having the most closed conformation, Mg2+ also coordinates to the carboxylate oxygen, the bridging ester oxygen, and a nonbridging phosphoryl oxygen of L-P-lactate. Mg2+ to L-P-lactate coordination is missing in subunits exhibiting a more open conformation. K+ coordinates to four protein ligands and to a phosphoryl oxygen of the L-P-lactate. The position and liganding of K+ are unaffected by the different conformations of the subunits. The side chain of Arg 72, Mg2+, and K+ provides a locus of positive charge for the phosphate moiety of the analog in the closed subunit.</p>

<p>A series of HIV-1 protease mutants has been designed in an effort to analyze the contribution to drug resistance provided by natural polymorphisms as well as therapy-selective (active and non-active site) mutations in the HIV-1 CRF_01 A/E (AE) protease when compared to that of the subtype B (B) protease. Kinetic analysis of these variants using chromogenic substrates showed differences in substrate specificity between pretherapy B and AE proteases. Inhibition analysis with ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, and atazanavir revealed that the natural polymorphisms found in A/E can influence inhibitor resistance. It was also apparent that a high level of resistance in the A/E protease, as with B protease, is due to it aquiring a combination of active site and non-active site mutations. Structural analysis of atazanavir bound to a pretherapy B protease showed that the ability of atazanavir to maintain its binding affinity for variants containing some resistance mutations is due to its unique interactions with flap residues. This structure also explains why the I50L and I84V mutations are important in decreasing the binding affinity of atazanavir.</p>

<p>Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGDO) uses a mononuclear nonheme Fe(2+) to catalyze the oxidative ring cleavage in the degradation of Tyr and Phe by producing maleylacetoacetate from homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate). Here, we report three crystal structures of HGDO, revealing five different steps in its reaction cycle at 1.7-1.98 Å resolution. The resting state structure displays an octahedral coordination for Fe(2+) with two histidine residues (His331 and His367), a bidentate carboxylate ligand (Glu337), and two water molecules. Homogentisate binds as a monodentate ligand to Fe(2+), and its interaction with Tyr346 invokes the folding of a loop over the active site, effectively shielding it from solvent. Binding of homogentisate is driven by enthalpy and is entropically disfavored as shown by anoxic isothermal titration calorimetry. Three different reaction cycle intermediates have been trapped in different HGDO subunits of a single crystal showing the influence of crystal packing interactions on the course of enzymatic reactions. The observed superoxo:semiquinone-, alkylperoxo-, and product-bound intermediates have been resolved in a crystal grown anoxically with homogentisate, which was subsequently incubated with dioxygen. We demonstrate that, despite different folds, active site architectures, and Fe(2+) coordination, extradiol dioxygenases can proceed through the same principal reaction intermediates to catalyze the O2-dependent cleavage of aromatic rings. Thus, convergent evolution of nonhomologous enzymes using the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad motif developed different solutions to stabilize closely related intermediates in unlike environments. </p>

<p>Ferrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase, E.C. 4.99.1.1) is the terminal enzyme in heme biosynthesis and catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX to form protoheme IX (heme). Within the past two years, X-ray crystallographic data obtained with human ferrochelatase have clearly shown that significant structural changes occur during catalysis that are predicted to facilitate metal insertion and product release. One unanswered question about ferrochelatase involves defining the mechanism whereby some metals, such as divalent Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn, can be used by the enzyme in vitro to produce the corresponding metalloporphyrins, while other metals, such as divalent Mn, Hg, Cd, or Pb, are inhibitors of the enzyme. Through the use of high-resolution X-ray crystallography along with characterization of metal species via their anomalous diffraction, the identity and position of Hg, Cd, Ni, or Mn in the center of enzyme-bound porphyrin macrocycle were determined. When Pb, Hg, Cd, or Ni was present in the macrocycle, the conserved pi helix was in the extended, partially unwound "product release" state. Interestingly, in the structure of ferrochelatase with Mn-porphyrin bound, the pi helix is not extended or unwound and is in the "substrate-bound" conformation. These findings show that at least in the cases of Mn, Pb, Cd, and Hg, metal "inhibition" of ferrochelatase is not due to the inability of the enzyme to insert the metal into the macrocycle or by binding to a second metal binding site as has been previously proposed. Rather, inhibition occurs after metal insertion and results from poor or diminished product release. Possible explanations for the lack of product release are proposed herein.</p>

<p>Methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) are enzymes that catalyze the reduction of methionine sulfoxide back to methionine. In vivo, Msrs are essential in the protection of cells against oxidative damage to proteins and in the virulence of some bacteria. Two structurally unrelated classes of Msrs, named MsrA and MsrB, exist. MsrB are stereospecific to R epimer on the sulfur of sulfoxide. All MsrB share a common reductase step with the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate. For the subclass of MsrB whose recycling process passes through the formation of an intradisulfide bond, the recycling reducer is thioredoxin. In the present study, X-ray structures of Neisseria meningitidis MsrB have been determined. The structures have a fold based on two beta-sheets, similar to the fold already described for other MsrB, with the recycling Cys63 located in a position favorable for disulfide bond formation with the catalytic Cys117. X-ray structures of Xanthomonas campestris MsrB have also been determined. In the C117S MsrB structure with a bound substrate, the recycling Cys31 is far from Ser117, with Trp65 being essential in the reductase step located in between. This positioning prevents the formation of the Cys31-Cys117 disulfide bond. In the oxidized structure, a drastic conformational reorganization of the two beta-sheets due to withdrawal of the Trp65 region from the active site, which remains compatible with an efficient thioredoxin-recycling process, is observed. The results highlight the remarkable structural malleability of the MsrB fold.</p>

<p>Glucose isomerase from Streptomyces rubiginosus was crystallized in two forms: I222, with one molecule of 44 kDa in the asymmetric unit, and P2(1)2(1)2, with two unique molecules. The I222 structure is known, but the P2(1)2(1)2 form has not been solved before. X-ray diffraction data for the P2(1)2(1)2 form were collected at a wavelength of 1.54 A and data for the I222 form were collected at three different wavelengths: 1.34, 1.07 and 0.98 A. The amount of anomalous signal from one Mn and eight S atoms in these data sets varies from 1.24% to as low as 0.56%. The dual-space direct-methods program SHELXD, run against the Bijvoet differences, gave a clear solution of all anomalous scatterers for all data sets. The Mn positions only were used for SAD phasing of all four data sets. The electron-density map after density modification, resulting from the phasing of a single-wavelength data set and based purely on the anomalous deltaf" contribution, was clearly interpretable; an almost complete model of the protein was built by wARP without human intervention in all four cases. As far as is known, this is the first time that an anomalous signal as low as 0.6% has successfully been used to determine the structure of a macromolecule.</p>

<p>The hybrid cluster proteins from the sulfate reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 ( Dd) and Desulfovibrio vulgaris strain Hildenborough ( Dv) have been isolated and crystallized anaerobically. In each case, the protein has been reduced with dithionite and the crystal structure of the reduced form elucidated using X-ray synchrotron radiation techniques at 1.25 A and 1.55 A resolution for Dd and Dv, respectively. Although the overall structures of the proteins are unchanged upon reduction, there are significant changes at the hybrid cluster centres. These include significant movements in the position of the iron atom linked to the persulfide moiety in the oxidized as-isolated proteins and the sulfur atom of the persulfide itself. The nature of these changes is described and the implications with respect to the function of hybrid cluster proteins are discussed.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the tetrameric alpha2beta2 acetyl-coenzyme A synthase/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Moorella thermoacetica has been solved at 1.9 A resolution. Surprisingly, the two alpha subunits display different (open and closed) conformations. Furthermore, X-ray data collected from crystals near the absorption edges of several metal ions indicate that the closed form contains one Zn and one Ni at its active site metal cluster (A-cluster) in the alpha subunit, whereas the open form has two Ni ions at the corresponding positions. Alternative metal contents at the active site have been observed in a recent structure of the same protein in which A-clusters contained one Cu and one Ni, and in reconstitution studies of a recombinant apo form of a related acetyl-CoA synthase. On the basis of our observations along with previously reported data, we postulate that only the A-clusters containing two Ni ions are catalytically active.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the dimeric catalytic domain (residues 118-424) of human PheOH (hPheOH), cocrystallized with the oxidized form of the cofactor (7,8-dihydro-L-biopterin, BH(2)), has been determined at 2.0 A resolution. The pterin binds in the second coordination sphere of the catalytic iron (the C4a atom is 6.1 A away), and interacts through several hydrogen bonds to two water molecules coordinated to the iron, as well as to the main chain carbonyl oxygens of Ala322, Gly247, and Leu249 and the main chain amide of Leu249. Some important conformational changes are seen in the active site upon pterin binding. The loop between residues 245 and 250 moves in the direction of the iron, and thus allows for several important hydrogen bonds to the pterin ring to be formed. The pterin cofactor is in an ideal orientation for dioxygen to bind in a bridging position between the iron and the pterin. The pterin ring forms an aromatic pi-stacking interaction with Phe254, and Tyr325 contributes to the positioning of the pterin ring and its dihydroxypropyl side chain by hydrophobic interactions. Of particular interest in the hPheOH x BH(2) binary complex structure is the finding that Glu286 hydrogen bonds to one of the water molecules coordinated to the iron as well as to a water molecule which hydrogen bonds to N3 of the pterin ring. Site-specific mutations of Glu286 (E286A and E286Q), Phe254 (F254A and F254L), and Tyr325 (Y325F) have confirmed the important contribution of Glu286 and Phe254 to the normal positioning of the pterin cofactor and catalytic activity of hPheOH. Tyr325 also contributes to the correct positioning of the pterin, but has no direct function in the catalytic reaction, in agreement with the results obtained with rat TyrOH [Daubner, S. C., and Fitzpatrick, P. F. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 16440-16444]. Superposition of the binary hPheOH.BH(2) complex onto the crystal structure of the ligand-free rat PheOH (which contains the regulatory and catalytic domains) [Kobe, B., Jennings, I. G., House, C. M., Michell, B. J., Goodwill, K. E., Santarsiero, B. D., Stevens, R. C., Cotton, R. G. H., and Kemp, B. E. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 442-448] reveals that the C2'-hydroxyl group of BH(2) is sufficiently close to form hydrogen bonds to Ser23 in the regulatory domain. Similar interactions are seen with the hPheOH.adrenaline complex and Ser23. These interactions suggest a structural explanation for the specific regulatory properties of the dihydroxypropyl side chain of BH(4) (negative effector) in the full-length enzyme in terms of phosphorylation of Ser16 and activation by L-Phe.</p>

<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is an essential metabolic enzyme operating in the gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that the enzyme contains a mobile active site lid domain that undergoes a transition between an open, disorded conformation and a closed, ordered conformation as the enzyme progresses through the catalytic cycle. The understanding of how this mobile domain functions in catalysis is incomplete. Previous studies showed that the closure of the lid domain stabilizes the reaction intermediate and protects the reactive intermediate from spurious protonation and thus contributes to the fidelity of the enzyme. To more fully investigate the roles of the lid domain in PEPCK function, we introduced three mutations that replaced the 11-residue lid domain with one, two, and three glycine residues. Kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes demonstrates that none of the enzyme constructs exhibit any measurable kinetic activity, resulting in a decrease in the catalytic parameters of at least 10(6). Structural characterization of the mutants in complexes representing the catalytic cycle suggests that the inactivity is due to a role for the lid domain in the formation of the fully closed state of the enzyme that is required for catalytic function. In the absence of the lid domain, the enzyme is unable to achieve the fully closed state and is rendered inactive despite possessing all of the residues and substrates required for catalytic function. This work demonstrates how enzyme catalytic function can be abolished through the alteration of conformational equilibria despite all the elements required for chemical conversion of substrates to products remaining intact.</p>

<p>Cathepsin B is a member of the papain superfamily of cysteine proteases and has been implicated in the pathology of numerous diseases, including arthritis and cancer. As part of an effort to identify potent, reversible inhibitors of this protease, we examined a series of dipeptidyl nitriles, starting with the previously reported Cbz-Phe-NH-CH(2)CN (19, IC(50) = 62 microM). High-resolution X-ray crystallographic data and molecular modeling were used to optimize the P(1), P(2), and P(3) substituents of this template. Cathepsin B is unique in its class in that it contains a carboxylate recognition site in the S(2)' pocket of the active site. Inhibitor potency and selectivity were enhanced by tethering a carboxylate functionality from the carbon alpha to the nitrile to interact with this region of the enzyme. This resulted in the identification of compound 10, a 7 nM inhibitor of cathepsin B, with excellent selectivity over other cysteine cathepsins.</p>

<p>Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDK) are characterized by high catalytic turnover rates and diverse substrate specificity. These features make this enzyme an effective activator of a pro-drug-an application that has been actively pursued for a variety of therapeutic strategies. The catalytic mechanism of this enzyme is governed by a conserved histidine that coordinates a magnesium ion at the active site. Despite substantial structural and biochemical information on NDK, the mechanistic feature of the phospho-transfer that leads to auto-phosphorylation remains unclear. While the role of the histidine residue is well documented, the other active site residues, in particular the conserved serine remains poorly characterized. Studies on some homologues suggest no role for the serine residue at the active site, while others suggest a crucial role for this serine in the regulation and quaternary association of this enzyme in some species. Here we report the biochemical features of the Staphylococcus aureus NDK and the mutant enzymes. We also describe the crystal structures of the apo-NDK, as a transition state mimic with vanadate and in complex with different nucleotide substrates. These structures formed the basis for molecular dynamics simulations to understand the broad substrate specificity of this enzyme and the role of active site residues in the phospho-transfer mechanism and oligomerization. Put together, these data suggest that concerted changes in the conformation of specific residues facilitate the stabilization of nucleotide complexes thereby enabling the steps involved in the ping-pong reaction mechanism without large changes to the overall structure of this enzyme.</p>

<p>The 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxo-G) lesion is the most abundant and mutagenic oxidative DNA damage existing in the genome. Due to its dual coding nature, 8-oxo-G causes most DNA polymerases to misincorporate adenine. Human Y-family DNA polymerase iota (polι) preferentially incorporates the correct cytosine nucleotide opposite 8-oxo-G. This unique specificity may contribute to polι's biological role in cellular protection against oxidative stress. However, the structural basis of this preferential cytosine incorporation is currently unknown. Here we present four crystal structures of polι in complex with DNA containing an 8-oxo-G lesion, paired with correct dCTP or incorrect dATP, dGTP, and dTTP nucleotides. An exceptionally narrow polι active site restricts the purine bases in a syn conformation, which prevents the dual coding properties of 8-oxo-G by inhibiting syn/anti conformational equilibrium. More importantly, the 8-oxo-G base in a syn conformation is not mutagenic in polι because its Hoogsteen edge does not form a stable base pair with dATP in the narrow active site. Instead, the syn 8-oxo-G template base forms the most stable replicating base pair with correct dCTP due to its small pyrimidine base size and enhanced hydrogen bonding with the Hoogsteen edge of 8-oxo-G. In combination with site directed mutagenesis, we show that Gln59 in the finger domain specifically interacts with the additional O(8) atom of the lesion base, which influences nucleotide selection, enzymatic efficiency, and replication stalling at the lesion site. Our work provides the structural mechanism of high-fidelity 8-oxo-G replication by a human DNA polymerase.</p>

<p>Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 is a thermophilic Gram-positive bacterium that produces two selective family 10 xylanases which both take part in the complete degradation and utilization of the xylan polymer. The two xylanases exhibit significantly different substrate specificities. While the extracellular xylanase (XT6; MW 43.8 kDa) hydrolyzes the long and branched native xylan polymer, the intracellular xylanase (IXT6; MW 38.6 kDa) preferentially hydrolyzes only short xylo-oligosaccharides. In this study, the detailed three-dimensional structure of IXT6 is reported, as determined by X-ray crystallography. It was initially solved by molecular replacement and then refined at 1.45 A resolution to a final R factor of 15.0% and an R(free) of 19.0%. As expected, the structure forms the classical (alpha/beta)(8) fold, in which the two catalytic residues (Glu134 and Glu241) are located on the inner surface of the central cavity. The structure of IXT6 was compared with the highly homologous extracellular xylanase XT6, revealing a number of structural differences between the active sites of the two enzymes. In particular, structural differences derived from the unique subdomain in the carboxy-terminal region of XT6, which is completely absent in IXT6. These structural modifications may account for the significant differences in the substrate specificities of these otherwise very similar enzymes.</p>

<p>JMJD2A is a JmjC histone demethylase (HDM) that catalyzes the demethylation of di- and trimethylated Lys9 and Lys36 in histone H3 (H3K9me2/3 and H3K36me2/3). Here we present the crystal structures of the JMJD2A catalytic domain in complex with H3K9me3, H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 peptides. The structures reveal that histone substrates are recognized through a network of backbone hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that deposit the trimethyllysine into the active site. The trimethylated epsilon-ammonium cation is coordinated within a methylammonium-binding pocket through carbon-oxygen (CH...O) hydrogen bonds that position one of the zeta-methyl groups adjacent to the Fe(II) center for hydroxylation and demethylation. Mutations of the residues comprising this pocket abrogate demethylation by JMJD2A, with the exception of an S288A substitution, which augments activity, particularly toward H3K9me2. We propose that this residue modulates the methylation-state specificities of JMJD2 enzymes and other trimethyllysine-specific JmjC HDMs.</p>

<p>Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDK) are characterized by high catalytic turnover rates and diverse substrate specificity. These features make this enzyme an effective activator of a pro-drug-an application that has been actively pursued for a variety of therapeutic strategies. The catalytic mechanism of this enzyme is governed by a conserved histidine that coordinates a magnesium ion at the active site. Despite substantial structural and biochemical information on NDK, the mechanistic feature of the phospho-transfer that leads to auto-phosphorylation remains unclear. While the role of the histidine residue is well documented, the other active site residues, in particular the conserved serine remains poorly characterized. Studies on some homologues suggest no role for the serine residue at the active site, while others suggest a crucial role for this serine in the regulation and quaternary association of this enzyme in some species. Here we report the biochemical features of the Staphylococcus aureus NDK and the mutant enzymes. We also describe the crystal structures of the apo-NDK, as a transition state mimic with vanadate and in complex with different nucleotide substrates. These structures formed the basis for molecular dynamics simulations to understand the broad substrate specificity of this enzyme and the role of active site residues in the phospho-transfer mechanism and oligomerization. Put together, these data suggest that concerted changes in the conformation of specific residues facilitate the stabilization of nucleotide complexes thereby enabling the steps involved in the ping-pong reaction mechanism without large changes to the overall structure of this enzyme.</p>

<p>Allosteric activation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) from Escherichia coli by phosphoenolpyruvate implies rapid feed-forward activation of gluconeogenesis in heterotrophic bacteria. But how do such bacteria rapidly down-regulate an activated FBPase in order to avoid futile cycling? Demonstrated here is the allosteric inhibition of E. coli FBPase by glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), the first metabolite produced upon glucose transport into the cell. FBPase undergoes a quaternary transition from the canonical R-state to a T-like state in response to Glc-6-P and AMP ligation. By displacing Phe(15), AMP binds to an allosteric site comparable with that of mammalian FBPase. Relative movements in helices H1 and H2 perturb allosteric activator sites for phosphoenolpyruvate. Glc-6-P binds to allosteric sites heretofore not observed in previous structures, perturbing subunits that in pairs form complete active sites of FBPase. Glc-6-P and AMP are synergistic inhibitors of E. coli FBPase, placing AMP/Glc-6-P inhibition in bacteria as a possible evolutionary predecessor to AMP/fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibition in mammalian FBPases. With no exceptions, signature residues of allosteric activation appear in bacterial sequences along with key residues of the Glc-6-P site. FBPases in such organisms may be components of metabolic switches that allow rapid changeover between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis in response to nutrient availability.</p>

<p>Nucleoside 5'-O-phosphorothioates are formed in vivo as primary products of hydrolysis of oligo(nucleoside phosphorothioate)s (PS-oligos) that are applied as antisense therapeutic molecules. The biodistribution of PS-oligos and their pharmacokinetics have been widely reported, but little is known about their subsequent decay inside the organism. We suggest that the enzyme responsible for nucleoside 5'-O-monophosphorothioate ((d)NMPS) metabolism could be histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (Hint-1), a phosphoramidase belonging to the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily that is present in all forms of life. An additional, but usually ignored, activity of Hint-1 is its ability to catalyze the conversion of adenosine 5'-O-monophosphorothioate (AMPS) to 5'-O-monophosphate (AMP). By mutagenetic and biochemical studies, we defined the active site of Hint-1 and the kinetic parameters of the desulfuration reaction (P-S bond cleavage). Additionally, crystallographic analysis (resolution from 1.08 to 1.37 Å) of three engineered cysteine mutants showed the high similarity of their structures, which were not very different from the structure of WT Hint-1. Moreover, we found that not only AMPS but also other ribonucleoside and 2'-deoxyribonucleoside phosphorothioates are desulfurated by Hint-1 at the following relative rates: GMPS &gt; AMPS &gt; dGMPS ≥ CMPS &gt; UMPS &gt; dAMPS ≫ dCMPS &gt; TMPS, and during the reaction, hydrogen sulfide, which is thought to be the third gaseous mediator, was released.</p>

<p>Oxicams are widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but little is known about the molecular basis of the interaction with their target enzymes, the cyclooxygenases (COX). Isoxicam is a non-selective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 whereas meloxicam displays some selectivity for COX-2. Here we report crystal complexes of COX-2 with isoxicam and meloxicam at 2.0 angstroms and 2.45 angstroms, respectively, and a crystal complex of COX-1 with meloxicam at 2.4 angstroms. These structures reveal that the oxicams bind to the active site of COX-2 using a binding pose not seen with other NSAIDs through two highly coordinated water molecules. The 4-hydroxyl group on the thiazine ring partners with Ser-530 via hydrogen bonding and the heteroatom of the carboxamide ring of the oxicam scaffold interacts with Tyr-385 and Ser-530 through a highly coordinated water molecule. The nitrogen atom of the thiazine and the oxygen atom of the carboxamide bind to Arg-120 and Tyr-355 via another highly ordered water molecule. The rotation of Leu-531 in the structure opens a novel-binding pocket, which is not utilized for the binding of other NSAIDs. In addition, a detailed study of meloxicam-COX-2 interactions revealed that mutation of Val-434 to Ile significantly reduces inhibition by meloxicam due to subtle changes around Phe-518, giving rise to the preferential inhibition of COX-2 over COX-1.</p>

<p>The bacterial ω-transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-ωTA, EC2.6.1.18) catalyses industrially important transamination reactions by use of the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Here, we present four crystal structures of Cv-ωTA: two in the apo form, one in the holo form and one in an intermediate state, at resolutions between 1.35 and 2.4 Å. The enzyme is a homodimer with a molecular mass of ∼ 100 kDa. Each monomer has an active site at the dimeric interface that involves amino acid residues from both subunits. The apo-Cv-ωTA structure reveals unique 'relaxed' conformations of three critical loops involved in structuring the active site that have not previously been seen in a transaminase. Analysis of the four crystal structures reveals major structural rearrangements involving elements of the large and small domains of both monomers that reorganize the active site in the presence of PLP. The conformational change appears to be triggered by binding of the phosphate group of PLP. Furthermore, one of the apo structures shows a disordered 'roof ' over the PLP-binding site, whereas in the other apo form and the holo form the 'roof' is ordered. Comparison with other known transaminase crystal structures suggests that ordering of the 'roof' structure may be associated with substrate binding in Cv-ωTA and some other transaminases.</p>

<p>Collagen constitutes one-third of body protein in humans, reflecting its extensive role in health and disease. Of similar importance, therefore, are the idiosyncratic proteases that have evolved for collagen remodeling. The most efficient collagenases are those that enable clostridial bacteria to colonize their host tissues; but despite intense study, the structural and mechanistic basis of these enzymes has remained elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of collagenase G from Clostridium histolyticum at 2.55-Å resolution. By combining the structural data with enzymatic and mutagenesis studies, we derive a conformational two-state model of bacterial collagenolysis, in which recognition and unraveling of collagen microfibrils into triple helices, as well as unwinding of the triple helices, are driven by collagenase opening and closing.</p>

<p>To understand the structural basis for bisphosphonate therapy of bone diseases, we solved the crystal structures of human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) in its unliganded state, in complex with the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP) drugs zoledronate, pamidronate, alendronate, and ibandronate, and in the ternary complex with zoledronate and the substrate isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). By revealing three structural snapshots of the enzyme catalytic cycle, each associated with a distinct conformational state, and details about the interactions with N-BPs, these structures provide a novel understanding of the mechanism of FPPS catalysis and inhibition. In particular, the accumulating substrate, IPP, was found to bind to and stabilize the FPPS-N-BP complexes rather than to compete with and displace the N-BP inhibitor. Stabilization of the FPPS-N-BP complex through IPP binding is supported by differential scanning calorimetry analyses of a set of representative N-BPs. Among other factors such as high binding affinity for bone mineral, this particular mode of FPPS inhibition contributes to the exceptional in vivo efficacy of N-BP drugs. Moreover, our data form the basis for structure-guided design of optimized N-BPs with improved pharmacological properties.</p>

<p>Assembly of a spliceosome, catalyzing precursor-messenger RNA splicing, involves multiple RNA-protein remodeling steps, driven by eight conserved DEXD/H-box RNA helicases. The 250-kDa Brr2 enzyme, which is essential for U4/U6 di-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein disruption during spliceosome catalytic activation and for spliceosome disassembly, is the only member of this group that is permanently associated with the spliceosome, thus requiring its faithful regulation. At the same time, Brr2 represents a unique subclass of superfamily 2 nucleic acid helicases, containing tandem helicase cassettes. Presently, the mechanistic and regulatory consequences of this unconventional architecture are unknown. Here we show that in human Brr2, two ring-like helicase cassettes intimately interact and functionally cooperate and how retinitis pigmentosa-linked Brr2 mutations interfere with the enzyme's function. Only the N-terminal cassette harbors ATPase and helicase activities in isolation. Comparison with other helicases and mutational analyses show how it threads single-stranded RNA, and structural features suggest how it can load onto an internal region of U4/U6 di-snRNA. Although the C-terminal cassette does not seem to engage RNA in the same fashion, it binds ATP and strongly stimulates the N-terminal helicase. Mutations at the cassette interface, in an intercassette linker or in the C-terminal ATP pocket, affect this cross-talk in diverse ways. Together, our results reveal the structural and functional interplay between two helicase cassettes in a tandem superfamily 2 enzyme and point to several sites through which Brr2 activity may be regulated.</p>

<p>The pseudo-glycosyltransferase VldE catalyzes non-glycosidic C-N coupling between an unsaturated cyclitol and a saturated aminocyclitol with the conservation of the stereochemical configuration of the substrates to form validoxylamine A 7'-phosphate, the biosynthetic precursor of the antibiotic validamycin A. To study the molecular basis of its mechanism, the three-dimensional structures of VldE from Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. limoneus was determined in apo form, in complex with GDP, in complex with GDP and validoxylamine A 7'-phosphate, and in complex with GDP and trehalose. The structure of VldE with the catalytic site in both an "open" and "closed" conformation is also described. With these structures, the preferred binding of the guanine moiety by VldE, rather than the uracil moiety as seen in OtsA could be explained. The elucidation of the VldE structure in complex with the entirety of its products provides insight into the internal return mechanism by which catalysis occurs with a net retention of the stereochemical configuration of the donated cyclitol.</p>

<p>In a routine screening of our small-molecule compound collection we recently identified 4-arylazo-3,5-diamino-1H-pyrazoles as a novel group of ATP antagonists with moderate potency against CDK2-cyclin E. A preliminary SAR study based on 35 analogues suggests ways in which the pharmacophore could be further optimized, for example, via substitutions in the 4-aryl ring. Enzyme kinetics studies with the lead compound and X-ray crystallography of an inhibitor-CDK2 complex demonstrated that its mode of inhibition is competitive. Functional kinase assays confirmed the selectivity toward CDKs, with a preference for CDK9-cyclin T1. The most potent inhibitor, 4-[(3,5-diamino-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)diazenyl]phenol 31b (CAN508), reduced the frequency of S-phase cells of the cancer cell line HT-29 in antiproliferation assays. Further observed cellular effects included decreased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, inhibition of mRNA synthesis, and induction of the tumor suppressor protein p53, all of which are consistent with inhibition of CDK9.</p>

<p>cAMP is an evolutionary conserved, prototypic second messenger regulating numerous cellular functions. In mammals, cAMP is synthesized by one of 10 homologous adenylyl cyclases (ACs): nine transmembrane enzymes and one soluble AC (sAC). Among these, only sAC is directly activated by bicarbonate (HCO3(-)); it thereby serves as a cellular sensor for HCO3(-), carbon dioxide (CO2), and pH in physiological functions, such as sperm activation, aqueous humor formation, and metabolic regulation. Here, we describe crystal structures of human sAC catalytic domains in the apo state and in complex with substrate analog, products, and regulators. The activator HCO3(-) binds adjacent to Arg176, which acts as a switch that enables formation of the catalytic cation sites. An anionic inhibitor, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, inhibits sAC through binding to the active site entrance, which blocks HCO3(-) activation through steric hindrance and trapping of the Arg176 side chain. Finally, product complexes reveal small, local rearrangements that facilitate catalysis. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for sAC catalysis and cellular HCO3(-) sensing and a basis for targeting this system with drugs. </p>

<p>In the tryptophan synthase bienzyme complex, indole produced by substrate cleavage at the alpha-site is channeled to the beta-site via a 25 A long tunnel. Within the beta-site, indole and l-Ser react with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in a two-stage reaction to give l-Trp. In stage I, l-Ser forms an external aldimine, E(Aex1), which converts to the alpha-aminoacrylate aldimine, E(A-A). Formation of E(A-A) at the beta-site activates the alpha-site &gt;30-fold. In stage II, indole reacts with E(A-A) to give l-Trp. The binding of alpha-site ligands (ASLs) exerts strong allosteric effects on the reaction of substrates at the beta-site: the distribution of intermediates formed in stage I is shifted in favor of E(A-A), and the binding of ASLs triggers a conformational change in the beta-site to a state with an increased affinity for l-Ser. Here, we compare the behavior of new ASLs as allosteric effectors of stage I with the behavior of the natural product, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Rapid kinetics and kinetic isotope effects show these ASLs bind with affinities ranging from micro- to millimolar, and the rate-determining step for conversion of E(Aex1) to E(A-A) is increased by 8-10-fold. To derive a structure-based mechanism for stage I, X-ray structures of both the E(Aex1) and E(A-A) states complexed with the different ASLs were determined and compared with structures of the ASL complexes with the internal aldimine [Ngo, H., Harris, R., Kimmich, N., Casino, P., Niks, D., Blumenstein, L., Barends, T. R., Kulik, V., Weyand, M., Schlichting, I., and Dunn, M. F. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 7713-7727].</p>

<p>Allosteric interactions regulate substrate channeling in Salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase. The channeling of indole between the alpha- and beta-sites via the interconnecting 25 A tunnel is regulated by allosteric signaling arising from binding of ligand to the alpha-site, and covalent reaction of l-Ser at the beta-site. This signaling switches the alpha- and beta-subunits between open conformations of low activity and closed conformations of high activity. Our objective is to synthesize and characterize new classes of alpha-site ligands (ASLs) that mimic the binding of substrates, 3-indole-d-glycerol 3'-phosphate (IGP) or d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), for use in the investigation of alpha-site-beta-site interactions. The new synthesized IGP analogues contain an aryl group linked to an O-phosphoethanolamine moiety through amide, sulfonamide, or thiourea groups. The G3P analogue, thiophosphoglycolohydroxamate, contains a hydroxamic acid group linked to a thiophosphate moiety. Crystal structures of the internal aldimine complexed with G3P and with three of the new ASLs are presented. These structural and solution studies of the ASL complexes with the internal aldimine form of the enzyme establish the following. (1) ASL binding occurs with high specificity and relatively high affinities at the alpha-site. (2) Binding of the new ASLs slows the entry of indole analogues into the beta-site by blocking the tunnel opening at the alpha-site. (3) ASL binding stabilizes the closed conformations of the beta-subunit for the alpha-aminoacrylate and quinonoid forms of the enzyme. (4) The new ASLs exhibit allosteric properties that parallel the behaviors of IGP and G3P.</p>

<p>We have employed a structure-based three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) approach to predict the biochemical activity for inhibitors of T. cruzi dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS). Crystal structures of complexes of the enzyme with eight different inhibitors of the DHFR activity together with the structure in the substrate-free state (DHFR domain) were used to validate and refine docking poses of ligands that constitute likely active conformations. Structural information from these complexes formed the basis for the structure-based alignment used as input for the QSAR study. Contrary to indirect ligand-based approaches the strategy described here employs a direct receptor-based approach. The goal is to generate a library of selective lead inhibitors for further development as antiparasitic agents. 3D-QSAR models were obtained for T. cruzi DHFR-TS (30 inhibitors in learning set) and human DHFR (36 inhibitors in learning set) that show a very good agreement between experimental and predicted enzyme inhibition data. For crossvalidation of the QSAR model(s), we have used the 10% leave-one-out method. The derived 3D-QSAR models were tested against a few selected compounds (a small test set of six inhibitors for each enzyme) with known activity, which were not part of the learning set, and the quality of prediction of the initial 3D-QSAR models demonstrated that such studies are feasible. Further refinement of the models through integration of additional activity data and optimization of reliable docking poses is expected to lead to an improved predictive ability.</p>

<p>Ferritins are a family of proteins distributed widely in nature. In bacterial, plant, and animal cells, ferritin appears to serve as a soluble, bioavailable, and non-toxic form of iron provider. Ferritins from animal sources are heteropolymers composed of two types of subunit, H and L, which differ mainly by the presence (H) or absence (L) of active ferroxidase centres. We report the crystallographic structures of four human H apoferritin variants at a resolution of up to 1.5 Angstrom. Crystal derivatives using Zn(II) as redox-stable alternative for Fe(II), allows us to characterize the different metal-binding sites. The ferroxidase centre, which is composed of sites A and B, binds metal with a preference for the A site. In addition, distinct Zn(II)-binding sites were found in the 3-fold axes, 4-fold axes and on the cavity surface near the ferroxidase centre. To study the importance of the distance of the two metal atoms in the ferroxidase centre, single and double replacement of glutamate 27 (site A) and glutamate 107 (site B), the two axial ligands, by aspartate residues have been carried out. The consequences for metal binding and the correlation with Fe(II) oxidation rates are discussed.</p>

<p>The common mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) ALDH2(*)2 polymorphism is associated with impaired ethanol metabolism and decreased efficacy of nitroglycerin treatment. These physiological effects are due to the substitution of Lys for Glu-487 that reduces the k(cat) for these processes and increases the K(m) for NAD(+), as compared with ALDH2. In this study, we sought to understand the nature of the interactions that give rise to the loss of structural integrity and low activity in ALDH2(*)2 even when complexed with coenzyme. Consequently, we have solved the crystal structure of ALDH2(*)2 complexed with coenzyme to 2.5A(.) We have also solved the structures of a mutated form of ALDH2 where Arg-475 is replaced by Gln (R475Q). The structural and functional properties of the R475Q enzyme are intermediate between those of wild-type and the ALDH2(*)2 enzymes. In both cases, the binding of coenzyme restores most of the structural deficits observed in the apoenzyme structures. The binding of coenzyme to the R475Q enzyme restores its structure and catalytic properties to near wild-type levels. In contrast, the disordered helix within the coenzyme binding pocket of ALDH2(*)2 is reordered, but the active site is only partially reordered. Consistent with the structural data, ALDH2(*)2 showed a concentration-dependent increase in esterase activity and nitroglycerin reductase activity upon addition of coenzyme, but the levels of activity do not approach those of the wild-type enzyme or that of the R475Q enzyme. The data presented shows that Glu-487 maintains a critical function in linking the structure of the coenzyme-binding site to that of the active site through its interactions with Arg-264 and Arg-475, and in doing so, creates the stable structural scaffold conducive to catalysis.</p>

<p>A new beta-lactamase inhibitor, a methylidene penem having a 5,6-dihydro-8H-imidazo[2,1-c][1,4]oxazine heterocyclic substituent at the C6 position with a Z configuration, irreversibly inhibits both class A and class C serine beta-lactamases with IC(50) values of 0.4 and 9.0 nM for TEM-1 and SHV-1 (class A), respectively, and 4.8 nM in AmpC (class C) beta-lactamases. The compound also inhibits irreversibly the class C extended-spectrum GC1 beta-lactamase (IC(50) = 6.2 nM). High-resolution crystallographic structures of a reaction intermediate of (5R)-(6Z)-6-(5,6-dihydro-8H-imidazo[2,1-c][1,4]oxazin-2-ylmethylene)-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-3-carboxylic acid 1 with the SHV-1 beta-lactamase and with the GC1 beta-lactamase have been determined by X-ray diffraction to resolutions of 1.10 and 1.38 A, respectively. The two complexes were refined to crystallographic R-factors (R(free)) of 0.141 (0.186) and 0.138 (0.202), respectively. Cryoquenching of the reaction of 1 with each beta-lactamase crystal produced a common, covalently bound intermediate. After acylation of the serine, a nucleophilic attack by the departing thiolate on the C6' atom yielded a novel seven-membered 1,4-thiazepine ring having R stereochemistry at the new C7 moiety. The orientation of this ring in each complex differs by a 180 degrees rotation about the bond to the acylated serine. The acyl ester bond is stabilized to hydrolysis through resonance stabilization with the dihydrothiazepine ring and by low occupancy or disorder of hydrolytic water molecules. In the class A complex, the buried water molecule on the alpha-face of the ester bond appears to be loosely bound or absent. In the class C complex, a water molecule on the beta-face is disordered and poorly activated for hydrolysis. Here, the acyl intermediate is unable to assist its own hydrolysis, as is thought to occur with many class C substrates.</p>

<p>High-resolution structural data of protein inhibitor complexes are the key to rational drug design. Synchrotron radiation allows for atomic resolutions but is frequently accompanied by radiation damage to protein complexes. In this study a human aldose reductase mutant complexed with a bromine-substituted inhibitor was determined to atomic resolution [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 3onc]. Though the radiation dose was moderate, a selective disruption of a bromine-inhibitor bond during the experiment was observed while the protein appears unaffected. A covalent bond to bromine is cleaved and the displaced atom is not scattered throughout the crystal but can most likely be assigned as a bromide to an additional difference electron density peak observed in the structure. The bromide relocates to an adjacent unoccupied site where promising interactions to protein residues stabilize its position. These findings were verified by a second similar structure determined with considerably higher radiation dose (PDB code 3onb).</p>

<p>The X-ray crystal structures of human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) with bound inosine or transition-state analogues show His257 within hydrogen bonding distance of the 5'-hydroxyl. The mutants His257Phe, His257Gly, and His257Asp exhibited greatly decreased affinity for Immucillin-H (ImmH), binding this mimic of an early transition state as much as 370-fold (Km/Ki) less tightly than native PNP. In contrast, these mutants bound DADMe-ImmH, a mimic of a late transition state, nearly as well as the native enzyme. These results indicate that His257 serves an important role in the early stages of transition-state formation. Whereas mutation of His257 resulted in little variation in the PNP x DADMe-ImmH x SO4 structures, His257Phe x ImmH x PO4 showed distortion at the 5'-hydroxyl, indicating the importance of H-bonding in positioning this group during progression to the transition state. Binding isotope effect (BIE) and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies of the remote 5'-(3)H for the arsenolysis of inosine with native PNP revealed a BIE of 1.5% and an unexpectedly large intrinsic KIE of 4.6%. This result is interpreted as a moderate electronic distortion toward the transition state in the Michaelis complex with continued development of a similar distortion at the transition state. The mutants His257Phe, His257Gly, and His257Asp altered the 5'-(3)H intrinsic KIE to -3, -14, and 7%, respectively, while the BIEs contributed 2, 2, and -2%, respectively. These surprising results establish that forces in the Michaelis complex, reported by the BIEs, can be reversed or enhanced at the transition state.</p>

<p>The equilibrium mixture of yeast enolase with substrate, 2-phospho-D-glycerate (2-PGA), and product, phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate), has been crystallized from solutions of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) at pH 8.0. Crystals belong to the space group C2 and have unit cell dimensions a = 121.9 A, b = 73.2 A, c = 93.9 A, and beta = 93.3 degrees. The crystals have one dimer per asymmetric unit. Crystals of the equilibrium mixture and of the enolase complex of phosphonoacetohydroxamate (PhAH) are isomorphous, and the structure of the former complex was solved from the coordinates of enolase-(Mg2+)2-PhAH [Wedekind, J. E., Poyner, R. R., Reed, G. H., &amp; Rayment, I. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 9333-9342]. The current crystallographic R-factor is 17.7% for all recorded data (92% complete) to 1.8 A resolution. The electron density map is unambiguous with respect to the positions and liganding of both magnesium ions and with respect to the stereochemistry of substrate/product binding. Both magnesium ions are complexed to functional groups of the substrate/product. The higher affinity Mg2+ coordinates to the carboxylate side chains of Asp 246, Glu 295, and Asp 320, both carboxylate oxygens of the substrate/product, and a water molecule. One of the carboxylate oxygens of the substrate/product also coordinates to the lower affinity Mg2+-thus forming a mu-carboxylato bridge. The other ligands of the second Mg2+ are a phosphoryl oxygen of the substrate/product, two water molecules, and the carbonyl and gamma-oxygens of Ser 39 from the active site loop. The intricate coordination of both magnesium ions to the carboxylate group suggests that both metal ions participate in stabilizing negative charge in the carbanion (aci-carboxylate) intermediate. The epsilon-amino group of Lys 345 is positioned to serve as the base in the forward reaction whereas the carboxylate side chain of Glu 211 is positioned to interact with the 3-OH of 2-PGA. The structure provides a candid view of the catalytic machinery of enolase.</p>

<p>High-resolution structural data of protein inhibitor complexes are the key to rational drug design. Synchrotron radiation allows for atomic resolutions but is frequently accompanied by radiation damage to protein complexes. In this study a human aldose reductase mutant complexed with a bromine-substituted inhibitor was determined to atomic resolution [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 3onc]. Though the radiation dose was moderate, a selective disruption of a bromine-inhibitor bond during the experiment was observed while the protein appears unaffected. A covalent bond to bromine is cleaved and the displaced atom is not scattered throughout the crystal but can most likely be assigned as a bromide to an additional difference electron density peak observed in the structure. The bromide relocates to an adjacent unoccupied site where promising interactions to protein residues stabilize its position. These findings were verified by a second similar structure determined with considerably higher radiation dose (PDB code 3onb).</p>

<p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves the assembly of a network of proteins that select cargo, modify membrane shape and drive invagination, vesicle scission and uncoating. This network is initially assembled around adaptor protein (AP) appendage domains, which are protein interaction hubs. Using crystallography, we show that FxDxF and WVxF peptide motifs from synaptojanin bind to distinct subdomains on alpha-appendages, called 'top' and 'side' sites. Appendages use both these sites to interact with their binding partners in vitro and in vivo. Occupation of both sites simultaneously results in high-affinity reversible interactions with lone appendages (e.g. eps15 and epsin1). Proteins with multiple copies of only one type of motif bind multiple appendages and so will aid adaptor clustering. These clustered alpha(appendage)-hubs have altered properties where they can sample many different binding partners, which in turn can interact with each other and indirectly with clathrin. In the final coated vesicle, most appendage binding partners are absent and thus the functional status of the appendage domain as an interaction hub is temporal and transitory giving directionality to vesicle assembly.</p>

<p>Piperidine ligands are described that provide the first examples of non-peptidic ligand structures for the cyclophilin family of proteins. Crystal structures of two ligand complexes are compared with the unliganded protein and show ligand-induced changes in side-chain conformation and water binding. A peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase assay showed the dissociation constants of the two ligands to be 320 and 25 mM. This study also provides the first published data for both enzymatic activity and three-dimensional structure for any protein-ligand complex that binds with a high-millimolar dissociation constant. The structures may be of relevance in the field of drug design, as they suggest starting points for the design of larger tighter-binding analogues.</p>

<p>Flavoproteins catalyse a diversity of fundamental redox reactions and are one of the most studied enzyme families. As monooxygenases, they are universally thought to control oxygenation by means of a peroxyflavin species that transfers a single atom of molecular oxygen to an organic substrate. Here we report that the bacterial flavoenzyme EncM catalyses the peroxyflavin-independent oxygenation-dehydrogenation dual oxidation of a highly reactive poly(β-carbonyl). The crystal structure of EncM with bound substrate mimics and isotope labelling studies reveal previously unknown flavin redox biochemistry. We show that EncM maintains an unexpected stable flavin-oxygenating species, proposed to be a flavin-N5-oxide, to promote substrate oxidation and trigger a rare Favorskii-type rearrangement that is central to the biosynthesis of the antibiotic enterocin. This work provides new insight into the fine-tuning of the flavin cofactor in offsetting the innate reactivity of a polyketide substrate to direct its efficient electrocyclization. </p>

<p>Two crystal structures of recombinant Geobacillus stearothermophilus 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gs6PDH) in complex with the substrate 6-phosphogluconate have been determined at medium resolution. Gs6PDH shares significant sequence identity and structural similarity with the enzymes from Lactococcus lactis, sheep liver and the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, for which a range of structures have previously been reported. Comparisons indicate that amino-acid sequence conservation is more pronounced in the two domains that contribute to the architecture of the active site, namely the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, compared with the central domain, which is primarily involved in the subunit-subunit associations required to form a stable dimer. The active-site residues are highly conserved, as are the interactions with the 6-phosphogluconate. There is interest in 6PDH as a potential drug target for the protozoan parasite T. brucei, the pathogen responsible for African sleeping sickness. The recombinant T. brucei enzyme has proven to be recalcitrant to enzyme-ligand studies and a surrogate protein might offer new opportunities to investigate and characterize 6PDH inhibitors. The high degree of structural similarity, efficient level of expression and straightforward crystallization conditions mean that Gs6PDH may prove to be an appropriate model system for structure-based inhibitor design targeting the enzyme from Trypanosoma species.</p>

<p>Describing the organization of substrates and substrate analogues in the active site of cysteine dioxygenase identifies potential intermediates in this critical yet poorly understood reaction, the oxidation of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid. The fortuitous formation of persulfides under crystallization conditions has allowed their binding in the active site of cysteine dioxygenase to be studied. The crystal structures of cysteine persulfide and 3-mercaptopropionic acid persulfide bound to iron(II) in the active site show that binding of the persulfide occurs via the distal sulfide and, in the case of the cysteine persulfide, the amine also binds. Persulfide was detected by mass spectrometry in both the crystal and the drop, suggesting its origin is chemical rather than enzymatic. A mechanism involving the formation of the relevant disulfide from sulfide produced by hydrolysis of dithionite is proposed. In comparison, persulfenate {observed bound to cysteine dioxygenase [Simmons, C. R., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 11390]} is shown through mass spectrometry to occur only in the crystal and not in the surrounding drop, suggesting that in the crystalline state the persulfenate does not lie on the reaction pathway. Stabilization of both the persulfenate and the persulfides does, however, suggest the position in which dioxygen binds during catalysis. </p>

<p>Hookworms are parasitic nematodes that have a devastating impact on global health, particularly in developing countries. We report a biochemical and structural analysis of a peroxiredoxin from the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum, AcePrx-1. Peroxiredoxins provide antioxidant protection and act as signaling molecules and chaperones. AcePrx-1 is expressed in adult hookworms and can be inactivated by 2,3-bis(bromomethyl)quinoxaline-1,4-dioxide (conoidin A). Conoidin A inactivates AcePrx-1 by alkylating or crosslinking the catalytic cysteines, while maintaining the enzyme in the "locally unfolded" conformation. Irreversible oxidation of the resolving cysteine may contribute additional inhibitory activity. A crystal structure of oxidized AcePrx-1 reveals a disulfide-linked decamer. A helix macrodipole near the active site increases the reactivity of the catalytic cysteines to conoidin A. This work demonstrates the promise of conoidin compounds as probes to evaluate peroxiredoxins as drug targets in human parasites. </p>

<p>The microbial degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by the biphenyl catabolic (Bph) pathway is limited in part by the pathway's fourth enzyme, BphD. BphD catalyzes an unusual carbon-carbon bond hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA), in which the substrate is subject to histidine-mediated enol-keto tautomerization prior to hydrolysis. Chlorinated HOPDAs such as 3-Cl HOPDA inhibit BphD. Here we report that BphD preferentially hydrolyzed a series of 3-substituted HOPDAs in the order H&gt;F&gt;Cl&gt;Me, suggesting that catalysis is affected by steric, not electronic, determinants. Transient state kinetic studies performed using wild-type BphD and the hydrolysis-defective S112A variant indicated that large 3-substituents inhibited His-265-catalyzed tautomerization by 5 orders of magnitude. Structural analyses of S112A.3-Cl HOPDA and S112A.3,10-diF HOPDA complexes revealed a non-productive binding mode in which the plane defined by the carbon atoms of the dienoate moiety of HOPDA is nearly orthogonal to that of the proposed keto tautomer observed in the S112A.HOPDA complex. Moreover, in the 3-Cl HOPDA complex, the 2-hydroxo group is moved by 3.6 A from its position near the catalytic His-265 to hydrogen bond with Arg-190 and access of His-265 is blocked by the 3-Cl substituent. Nonproductive binding may be stabilized by interactions involving the 3-substituent with non-polar side chains. Solvent molecules have poor access to C6 in the S112A.3-Cl HOPDA structure, more consistent with hydrolysis occurring via an acyl-enzyme than a gem-diol intermediate. These results provide insight into engineering BphD for PCB degradation.</p>

<p>Type II dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a plasmid-encoded enzyme that confers resistance to bacterial DHFR-targeted antifolate drugs. It forms a symmetric homotetramer with a central pore which functions as the active site. Its unusual structure, which results in a promiscuous binding surface that accommodates either the dihydrofolate (DHF) substrate or the NADPH cofactor, has constituted a significant limitation to efforts to understand its substrate specificity and reaction mechanism. We describe here the first structure of a ternary R67 DHFR.DHF.NADP+ catalytic complex, resolved to 1.26 A. This structure provides the first clear picture of how this enzyme, which lacks the active site carboxyl residue that is ubiquitous in Type I DHFRs, is able to function. In the catalytic complex, the polar backbone atoms of two symmetry-related I68 residues provide recognition motifs that interact with the carboxamide on the nicotinamide ring, and the N3-O4 amide function on the pteridine ring. This set of interactions orients the aromatic rings of substrate and cofactor in a relative endo geometry in which the reactive centers are held in close proximity. Additionally, a central, hydrogen-bonded network consisting of two pairs of Y69-Q67-Q67'-Y69' residues provides an unusually tight interface, which appears to serve as a "molecular clamp" holding the substrates in place in an orientation conducive to hydride transfer. In addition to providing the first clear insight regarding how this extremely unusual enzyme is able to function, the structure of the ternary complex provides general insights into how a mutationally challenged enzyme, i.e., an enzyme whose evolution is restricted to four-residues-at-a-time active site mutations, overcomes this fundamental limitation.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the binuclear metallophosphotriesterases (PTEs, E.C. 3.1.8.1) catalyse substrate hydrolysis has been extensively studied. The mu-hydroxo bridge between the metal ions has been proposed to be the initiating nucleophile in the hydrolytic reaction. In contrast, analysis of some biomimetic systems has indicated that mu-hydroxo bridges are often not themselves nucleophiles, but act as general bases for freely exchangeable nucleophilic water molecules. Herein, we present crystallographic analyses of a bacterial PTE from Agrobacterium radiobacter, OpdA, capturing the enzyme-substrate complex during hydrolysis. This model of the Michaelis complex suggests the alignment of the substrate will favour attack from a solvent molecule terminally coordinated to the alpha-metal ion. The bridging of both metal ions by the product, without disruption of the mu-hydroxo bridge, is also consistent with nucleophilic attack occurring from the terminal position. When phosphodiesters are soaked into crystals of OpdA, they coordinate bidentately to the beta-metal ion, displacing the mu-hydroxo bridge. Thus, alternative product-binding modes exist for the PTEs, and it is the bridging mode that appears to result from phosphotriester hydrolysis. Kinetic analysis of the PTE and promiscuous phosphodiesterase activities confirms that the presence of a mu-hydroxo bridge during phosphotriester hydrolysis is correlated with a lower pK(a) for the nucleophile, consistent with a general base function during catalysis.</p>

<p>In most organisms, efficient D-galactose utilization requires the highly conserved Leloir pathway that converts D-galactose to D-glucose 1-phosphate. However, in some bacterial and fungal species alternative routes of D-galactose assimilation have been identified. In the so-called De Ley-Doudoroff pathway, D-galactose is metabolized into pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in five consecutive reactions carried out by specific enzymes. The penultimate step in this pathway involves the phosphorylation of 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate to 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate 6-phosphate catalyzed by 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate kinase, with ATP serving as a phosphoryl-group donor. Here, a crystal structure of 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate kinase from Klebsiella pneumoniae determined at 2.1 Å resolution is reported, the first structure of an enzyme from the De Ley-Doudoroff pathway. Structural comparison indicates that the enzyme belongs to the ASKHA (acetate and sugar kinases/hsc70/actin) family of phosphotransferases. The protein is composed of two α/β domains, each of which contains a core common to all family members. Additional elements introduced between conserved structural motifs define the unique features of 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate kinase and possibly determine the biological function of the protein.</p>

<p>AcpA is a respiratory burst-inhibiting acid phosphatase from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A bioterrorism agent Francisella tularensis and prototype of a superfamily of acid phosphatases and phospholipases C. We report the 1.75-A resolution crystal structure of AcpA complexed with the inhibitor orthovanadate, which is the first structure of any F. tularensis protein and the first for any member of this superfamily. The core domain is a twisted 8-stranded beta-sheet flanked by three alpha-helices on either side, with the active site located above the carboxyl-terminal edge of the beta-sheet. This architecture is unique among acid phosphatases and resembles that of alkaline phosphatase. Unexpectedly, the active site features a serine nucleophile and metal ion with octahedral coordination. Structure-based sequence analysis of the AcpA superfamily predicts that the hydroxyl nucleophile and metal center are also present in AcpA-like phospholipases C. These results imply a phospholipase C catalytic mechanism that is radically different from that of zinc metallophospholipases.</p>

<p>A key step decisively affecting the catalytic efficiency of copper amine oxidase is stereospecific abstraction of substrate alpha-proton by a conserved Asp residue. We analyzed this step by pre-steady-state kinetics using a bacterial enzyme and stereospecifically deuterium-labeled substrates, 2-phenylethylamine and tyramine. A small and temperature-dependent kinetic isotope effect (KIE) was observed with 2-phenylethylamine, whereas a large and temperature-independent KIE was observed with tyramine in the alpha-proton abstraction step, showing that this step is driven by quantum mechanical hydrogen tunneling rather than the classical transition-state mechanism. Furthermore, an Arrhenius-type preexponential factor ratio approaching a transition-state value was obtained in the reaction of a mutant enzyme lacking the critical Asp. These results provide strong evidence for enzyme-enhanced hydrogen tunneling. X-ray crystallographic structures of the reaction intermediates revealed a small difference in the binding mode of distal parts of substrates, which would modulate hydrogen tunneling proceeding through either active or passive dynamics.</p>

<p>The crystal structures and inhibitor complexes of two industrially important ω-aminotransferase enzymes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Chromobacterium violaceum have been determined in order to understand the differences in their substrate specificity. The two enzymes share 30% sequence identity and use the same amino acceptor, pyruvate; however, the Pseudomonas enzyme shows activity towards the amino donor β-alanine, whilst the Chromobacterium enzyme does not. Both enzymes show activity towards S-α-methylbenzylamine (MBA), with the Chromobacterium enzyme having a broader substrate range. The crystal structure of the P. aeruginosa enzyme has been solved in the holo form and with the inhibitor gabaculine bound. The C. violaceum enzyme has been solved in the apo and holo forms and with gabaculine bound. The structures of the holo forms of both enzymes are quite similar. There is little conformational difference observed between the inhibitor complex and the holoenzyme for the P. aeruginosa aminotransferase. In comparison, the crystal structure of the C. violaceum gabaculine complex shows significant structural rearrangements from the structures of both the apo and holo forms of the enzyme. It appears that the different rigidity of the protein scaffold contributes to the substrate specificity observed for the two ω-aminotransferases.</p>

<p>Selenomethionine labeling is the most common technique used in protein crystallography to derivatize recombinant proteins for experimental phasing using anomalous scattering at tunable synchrotron beamlines. Recently, it has been shown that UV radiation depletes electron density of selenium atoms of selenomethionine residues and that UV radiation-damage-induced phasing (equivalent to single isomorphous replacement) protocol can be applied to calculate experimental phases. Here we present the straightforward integration of a UV source with an in-house diffractometer. We show how this setup can extend the capabilities of a sealed tube X-ray generator and be used for experimental phasing of selenium-labeled proteins.</p>

<p>Dioxygen activation by nonhaem Fe(II) enzymes containing the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad has been extensively studied in recent years. Here, crystal structures of 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase, an enzyme that represents a minor group of extradiol dioxygenases and that catalyses the ring opening of 2-aminophenol, in complex with the lactone intermediate (4Z,6Z)-3-iminooxepin-2(3H)-one and the product 2-aminomuconic 6-semialdehyde and in complex with the suicide inhibitor 4-nitrocatechol are reported. The Fe-ligand binding schemes observed in these structures revealed some common geometrical characteristics that are shared by the published structures of extradiol dioxygenases, suggesting that enzymes that catalyse the oxidation of noncatecholic compounds are very likely to utilize a similar strategy for dioxygen activation and the fission of aromatic rings as the canonical mechanism. The Fe-ligation arrangement, however, is strikingly enantiomeric to that of all other 2-His-1-carboxylate enzymes apart from protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase. This structural variance leads to the generation of an uncommon O(-)-Fe(2+)-O(-) species prior to O(2) binding, which probably forms the structural basis on which APD distinguishes its specific substrate and inhibitor, which share an analogous molecular structure.</p>

<p>HIV-1 develops resistance to protease inhibitors predominantly by selecting mutations in the protease gene. Studies of resistant mutants of HIV-1 protease with single amino acid substitutions have shown a range of independent effects on specificity, inhibition, and stability. Four double mutants, K45I/L90M, K45I/V82S, D30N/V82S, and N88D/L90M were selected for analysis on the basis of observations of increased or decreased stability or enzymatic activity for the respective single mutants. The double mutants were assayed for catalysis, inhibition, and stability. Crystal structures were analyzed for the double mutants at resolutions of 2.2-1.2 A to determine the associated molecular changes. Sequence-dependent changes in protease-inhibitor interactions were observed in the crystal structures. Mutations D30N, K45I, and V82S showed altered interactions with inhibitor residues at P2/P2', P3/P3'/P4/P4', and P1/P1', respectively. One of the conformations of Met90 in K45I/L90M has an unfavorably close contact with the carbonyl oxygen of Asp25, as observed previously in the L90M single mutant. The observed catalytic efficiency and inhibition for the double mutants depended on the specific substrate or inhibitor. In particular, large variation in cleavage of p6(pol)-PR substrate was observed, which is likely to result in defects in the maturation of the protease from the Gag-Pol precursor and hence viral replication. Three of the double mutants showed values for stability that were intermediate between the values observed for the respective single mutants. D30N/V82S mutant showed lower stability than either of the two individual mutations, which is possibly due to concerted changes in the central P2-P2' and S2-S2' sites. The complex effects of combining mutations are discussed.</p>

<p>Cytochromes P450 play key roles in drug metabolism and disease by oxidizing a wide variety of natural and xenobiotic compounds. High-resolution crystal structures of P450cam bound to ruthenium sensitizer-linked substrates reveal an open conformation of the enzyme that allows substrates to access the active center via a 22-A deep channel. Interactions of alkyl and fluorinated biphenyl linkers with the channel demonstrate the importance of exploiting protein dynamics for specific inhibitor design. Large changes in peripheral enzyme structure (F and G helices) couple to conformational changes in active center residues (I helix) implicated in proton pumping and dioxygen activation. Common conformational states among P450cam and homologous enzymes indicate that static and dynamic variability in the F/G helix region allows the 54 human P450s to oxidize thousands of substrates.</p>

<p>We recently determined the first structures of inactivated and calcium-activated calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) from Apicomplexa. Calcium binding triggered a large conformational change that constituted a new mechanism in calcium signaling and a novel EF-hand fold (CAD, for CDPK activation domain). Thus we set out to determine if this mechanism was universal to all CDPKs. We solved additional CDPK structures, including one from the species Plasmodium. We highlight the similarities in sequence and structure across apicomplexan and plant CDPKs, and strengthen our observations that this novel mechanism could be universal to canonical CDPKs. Our new structures demonstrate more detailed steps in the mechanism of calcium activation and possible key players in regulation. Residues involved in making the largest conformational change are the most conserved across Apicomplexa, leading us to propose that the mechanism is indeed conserved. CpCDPK3_CAD and PfCDPK_CAD were captured at a possible intermediate conformation, lending insight into the order of activation steps. PfCDPK3_CAD adopts an activated fold, despite having an inactive EF-hand sequence in the N-terminal lobe. We propose that for most apicomplexan CDPKs, the mode of activation will be similar to that seen in our structures, while specific regulation of the inactive and active forms will require further investigation.</p>

<p>Hydrolysis of acetylcholine catalyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), one of the most efficient enzymes in nature, occurs at the base of a deep and narrow active center gorge. At the entrance of the gorge, the peripheral anionic site provides a binding locus for allosteric ligands, including substrates. To date, no structural information on substrate entry to the active center from the peripheral site of AChE or its subsequent egress has been reported. Complementary crystal structures of mouse AChE and an inactive mouse AChE mutant with a substituted catalytic serine (S203A), in various complexes with four substrates (acetylcholine, acetylthiocholine, succinyldicholine, and butyrylthiocholine), two non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues (m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)-trifluoroacetophenone and 4-ketoamyltrimethylammonium), and one reaction product (choline) were solved in the 2.05-2.65-A resolution range. These structures, supported by binding and inhibition data obtained on the same complexes, reveal the successive positions and orientations of the substrates bound to the peripheral site and proceeding within the gorge toward the active site, the conformations of the presumed transition state for acylation and the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and the positions and orientations of the dissociating and egressing products. Moreover, the structures of the AChE mutant in complexes with acetylthiocholine and succinyldicholine reveal additional substrate binding sites on the enzyme surface, distal to the gorge entry. Hence, we provide a comprehensive set of structural snapshots of the steps leading to the intermediates of catalysis and the potential regulation by substrate binding to various allosteric sites at the enzyme surface.</p>

Moreover, the structures of the AChE mutant in complexes with acetylthiocholine and succinyldicholine reveal additional substrate binding sites on the enzyme surface, distal to the gorge entry. Hence, we provide a comprehensive set of structural snapshots of the steps leading to the intermediates of catalysis and the potential regulation by substrate binding to various allosteric sites at the enzyme surface.</p>

<p>The bifunctional proline catabolic flavoenzyme, proline utilization A (PutA), catalyzes the oxidation of proline to glutamate via the sequential activities of FAD-dependent proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and NAD(+)-dependent Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) domains. Although structures for some of the domains of PutA are known, a structure for the full-length protein has not previously been solved. Here we report the 2.1 A resolution crystal structure of PutA from Bradyrhizobium japonicum, along with data from small-angle x-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and steady-state and rapid-reaction kinetics. PutA forms a ring-shaped tetramer in solution having a diameter of 150 A. Within each protomer, the PRODH and P5CDH active sites face each other at a distance of 41 A and are connected by a large, irregularly shaped cavity. Kinetics measurements show that glutamate production occurs without a lag phase, suggesting that the intermediate, Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, is preferably transferred to the P5CDH domain rather than released into the bulk medium. The structural and kinetic data imply that the cavity serves both as a microscopic vessel for the hydrolysis of Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate to glutamate semialdehyde and a protected conduit for the transport of glutamate semialdehyde to the P5CDH active site.</p>

<p>We report the first crystal structures of a family II pyrophosphatase complexed with a substrate analogue, imidodiphosphate (PNP). These provide new insights into the catalytic reaction mechanism of this enzyme family. We were able to capture the substrate complex both by fluoride inhibition and by site-directed mutagenesis providing complementary snapshots of the Michaelis complex. Structures of both the fluoride-inhibited wild type and the H98Q variant of the PNP-Bacillus subtilis pyrophosphatase complex show a unique trinuclear metal center. Each metal ion coordinates a terminal oxygen on the electrophilic phosphate and a lone pair on the putative nucleophile, thus placing it in line with the scissile bond without any coordination by protein. The nucleophile moves further away from the electrophilic phosphorus site, to the opposite side of the trimetal plane, upon binding of substrate. In comparison with earlier product complexes, the side chain of Lys296 has swung in and so three positively charged side chains, His98, Lys205 and Lys296, now surround the bridging nitrogen in PNP. Finally, one of the active sites in the wild-type structure appears to show evidence of substrate distortion. Binding to the enzyme may thus strain the substrate and thus enhance the catalytic rate.</p>

<p>Hydrolysis of acetylcholine catalyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), one of the most efficient enzymes in nature, occurs at the base of a deep and narrow active center gorge. At the entrance of the gorge, the peripheral anionic site provides a binding locus for allosteric ligands, including substrates. To date, no structural information on substrate entry to the active center from the peripheral site of AChE or its subsequent egress has been reported. Complementary crystal structures of mouse AChE and an inactive mouse AChE mutant with a substituted catalytic serine (S203A), in various complexes with four substrates (acetylcholine, acetylthiocholine, succinyldicholine, and butyrylthiocholine), two non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues (m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)-trifluoroacetophenone and 4-ketoamyltrimethylammonium), and one reaction product (choline) were solved in the 2.05-2.65-A resolution range. These structures, supported by binding and inhibition data obtained on the same complexes, reveal the successive positions and orientations of the substrates bound to the peripheral site and proceeding within the gorge toward the active site, the conformations of the presumed transition state for acylation and the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and the positions and orientations of the dissociating and egressing products.

<p>Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) from Bacillus stearothermophilus (bsSHMT) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyses the conversion of L-serine and tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. In addition, the enzyme catalyses the tetrahydrofolate-independent cleavage of 3-hydroxy amino acids and transamination. In this article, we have examined the mechanism of the tetrahydrofolate-independent cleavage of 3-hydroxy amino acids by SHMT. The three-dimensional structure and biochemical properties of Y51F and Y61A bsSHMTs and their complexes with substrates, especially L-allo-Thr, show that the cleavage of 3-hydroxy amino acids could proceed via Calpha proton abstraction rather than hydroxyl proton removal. Both mutations result in a complete loss of tetrahydrofolate-dependent and tetrahydrofolate-independent activities. The mutation of Y51 to F strongly affects the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, possibly as a consequence of a change in the orientation of the phenyl ring in Y51F bsSHMT. The mutant enzyme could be completely reconstituted with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. However, there was an alteration in the lambda max value of the internal aldimine (396 nm), a decrease in the rate of reduction with NaCNBH3 and a loss of the intermediate in the interaction with methoxyamine (MA). The mutation of Y61 to A results in the loss of interaction with Calpha and Cbeta of the substrates. X-Ray structure and visible CD studies show that the mutant is capable of forming an external aldimine. However, the formation of the quinonoid intermediate is hindered. It is suggested that Y61 is involved in the abstraction of the Calpha proton from 3-hydroxy amino acids. A new mechanism for the cleavage of 3-hydroxy amino acids via Calpha proton abstraction by SHMT is proposed.</p>

<p>The structure of Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase (PPLO) in a new crystal form has been refined at 1.23 Angstrom resolution. PPLO, a copper amine oxidase (CuAO) with a 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor, differs from most other members of the CuAO enzyme family in having the ability to oxidize the side chain of lysine residues in a polypeptide. In the asymmetric unit of the crystals, the structure analysis has located residues 43-779 of the polypeptide chain, seven carbohydrate residues, the active-site Cu atom, an imidazole molecule bound at the active site, two buried Ca(2+) ions, five surface Mg(2+) ions, five surface Cl(-) ions and 1045 water molecules. The crystallographic residuals are R = 0.112 and R(free) = 0.146. The TPQ cofactor and several other active-site residues are poorly ordered, in contrast to the surrounding well ordered structure. A covalent cross-link is observed between two lysine residues, Lys778 and Lys66. The cross-link is likely to have been formed by the oxidation of Lys778 followed by a spontaneous reaction with Lys66. The link is modelled as dehydrolysinonorleucine.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the alpha-amylase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus woesei was solved in the presence of three inhibitors: acarbose, Tris, and zinc. In the absence of exogenous metals, this alpha-amylase bound 1 and 4 molar eq of zinc and calcium, respectively. The structure reveals a novel, activating, two-metal (Ca,Zn)-binding site and a second inhibitory zinc-binding site that is found in the -1 sugar-binding pocket within the active site. The data resolve the apparent paradox between the zinc requirement for catalytic activity and its strong inhibitory effect when added in molar excess. They provide a rationale as to why this alpha-amylase, in contrast to commercially available alpha-amylases, does not require the addition of metal ions for full catalytic activity, suggesting it as an ideal target to maximize the efficiency of industrial processes like liquefaction of starch.</p>

<p>Human carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1) is a broad-spectrum bioscavenger that plays important roles in narcotic metabolism, clinical prodrug activation, and the processing of fatty acid and cholesterol derivatives. We determined the 2.4 A crystal structure of hCE1 in complex with tacrine, the first drug approved for treating Alzheimer's disease, and compare this structure to the Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (AcChE)-tacrine complex. Tacrine binds in multiple orientations within the catalytic gorge of hCE1, while it stacks in the smaller AcChE active site between aromatic side chains. Our results show that hCE1's promiscuous action on distinct substrates is enhanced by its ability to interact with ligands in multiple orientations at once. Further, we use our structure to identify tacrine derivatives that act as low-micromolar inhibitors of hCE1 and may provide new avenues for treating narcotic abuse and cholesterol-related diseases.</p>

<p>We present the first crystal structures of a human protein bound to analogs of cocaine and heroin. Human carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1) is a broad-spectrum bioscavenger that catalyzes the hydrolysis of heroin and cocaine, and the detoxification of organophosphate chemical weapons, such as sarin, soman and tabun. Crystal structures of the hCE1 glycoprotein in complex with the cocaine analog homatropine and the heroin analog naloxone provide explicit details about narcotic metabolism in humans. The hCE1 active site contains both specific and promiscuous compartments, which enable the enzyme to act on structurally distinct chemicals. A selective surface ligand-binding site regulates the trimer-hexamer equilibrium of hCE1 and allows each hCE1 monomer to bind two narcotic molecules simultaneously. The bioscavenger properties of hCE1 can likely be used to treat both narcotic overdose and chemical weapon exposure.</p>

<p>Human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) hydrolyzes or scavenges a wide range of toxic esters, including heroin, cocaine, carbamate pesticides, organophosphorus pesticides, and nerve agents. Organophosphates (OPs) exert their acute toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by phosphorylation of the catalytic serine. Phosphylated cholinesterase (ChE) can undergo a spontaneous, time-dependent process called "aging", during which the OP-ChE conjugate is dealkylated. This leads to irreversible inhibition of the enzyme. The inhibition of ChEs by tabun and the subsequent aging reaction are of particular interest, because tabun-ChE conjugates display an extraordinary resistance toward most current oxime reactivators. We investigated the structural basis of oxime resistance for phosphoramidated ChE conjugates by determining the crystal structures of the non-aged and aged forms of hBChE inhibited by tabun, and by updating the refinement of non-aged and aged tabun-inhibited mouse AChE (mAChE). Structures for non-aged and aged tabun-hBChE were refined to 2.3 and 2.1 A, respectively. The refined structures of aged ChE conjugates clearly show that the aging reaction proceeds through O-dealkylation of the P(R) enantiomer of tabun. After dealkylation, the negatively charged oxygen forms a strong salt bridge with protonated His438N epsilon2 that prevents reactivation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the aged tabun-inhibited hBChE showed that both the dimethylamine and ethoxy side chains were missing from the phosphorus. Loss of the ethoxy is consistent with the crystallography results. Loss of the dimethylamine is consistent with acid-catalyzed deamidation during the preparation of the aged adduct for mass spectrometry. The reported 3D data will help in the design of new oximes capable of reactivating tabun-ChE conjugates.</p>

<p>The Nit (nitrilase-like) protein subfamily constitutes branch 10 of the nitrilase superfamily. Nit proteins are widely distributed in nature. Mammals possess two members of the Nit subfamily, namely Nit1 and Nit2. Based on sequence similarity, yeast Nit2 (yNit2) is a homologue of mouse Nit1, a tumour-suppressor protein whose substrate specificity is not yet known. Previous studies have shown that mammalian Nit2 (also a putative tumour suppressor) is identical to ω-amidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-ketoglutaramate (α-KGM) and α-ketosuccinamate (α-KSM) to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and oxaloacetate (OA), respectively. In the present study, crystal structures of wild-type (WT) yNit2 and of WT yNit2 in complex with α-KG and with OA were determined. In addition, the crystal structure of the C169S mutant of yNit2 (yNit2-C169S) in complex with an endogenous molecule of unknown structure was also solved. Analysis of the structures revealed that α-KG and OA are covalently bound to Cys169 by the formation of a thioester bond between the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue and the γ-carboxyl group of α-KG or the β-carboxyl group of OA, reflecting the presumed reaction intermediates. However, an enzymatic assay suggests that α-KGM is a relatively poor substrate of yNit2. Finally, a ligand was found in the active site of yNit2-C169S that may be a natural substrate of yNit2 or an endogenous regulator of enzyme activity. These crystallographic analyses provide information on the mode of substrate/ligand binding at the active site of yNit2 and insights into the catalytic mechanism. These findings suggest that yNit2 may have broad biological roles in yeast, especially in regard to nitrogen homeostasis, and provide a framework for the elucidation of the substrate specificity and biological role of mammalian Nit1. </p>

<p>The haloacid dehalogenase enzyme superfamily (HADSF) is largely composed of phosphatases that have been particularly successful at adaptating to novel biological functions relative to members of other phosphatase families. Herein, we examine the structural basis for the divergence of function in two bacterial homologues: 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate phosphohydrolase (KDO8P phosphatase, KDO8PP) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-9-O-phosphonononic acid phosphohydrolase (KDN9P phosphatase, KDN9PP). KDO8PP and KDN9PP catalyze the final step in KDO and KDN synthesis, respectively, prior to transfer to CMP to form the activated sugar nucleotide. KDO8PP and KDN9PP orthologs derived from an evolutionarily diverse collection of bacterial species were subjected to steady-state kinetic analysis to determine their specificities toward catalyzed KDO8P and KDN9P hydrolysis. Although each enzyme was more active with its biological substrate, the degree of selectivity (as defined by the ratio of kcat/Km for KDO8P vs KDN9P) varied significantly. High-resolution X-ray structure determination of Haemophilus influenzae KDO8PP bound to KDO/VO3(-) and Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron KDN9PP bound to KDN/VO3(-) revealed the substrate-binding residues. The structures of the KDO8PP and KDN9PP orthologs were also determined to reveal the differences in their active-site structures that underlie the variation in substrate preference. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to define the sequence divergence among KDN9PP and KDO8PP orthologs. The KDN9PP orthologs were found to exist as single-domain proteins or fused with the pathway nucleotidyl transferases; the fusion of KDO8PP with the transferase is rare. The KDO8PP and KDN9PP orthologs share a stringently conserved Arg residue that forms a salt bridge with the substrate carboxylate group. The split of the KDN9PP lineage from the KDO8PP orthologs is easily tracked by the acquisition of a Glu/Lys pair that supports KDN9P binding. Moreover, independently evolved lineages of KDO8PP orthologs exist, and are separated by diffuse active-site sequence boundaries. We infer a high tolerance of the KDO8PP catalytic platform to amino acid replacements that in turn influence substrate specificity changes and thereby facilitate the divergence in biological function. </p>

<p>Peptide-peptoid hybrids are found to be potent inhibitors of serine proteases. These engineered peptidomimetics benefit from both types of units of the biopolymeric structure: the natural inhibitor part serves as a good binding template, while the P1-positioned peptoid component provides complete resistance towards proteolysis. In this report, the mechanism of proteolytic resistance of a P1 peptoid-containing analogue is postulated based on the crystal structure of the (NLys)(5)-modified sunflower trypsin inhibitor SFTI-1 in complex with bovine trypsin solved at 1.29 Å resolution. The structural differences between the (NLys)(5)SFTI-1-trypsin complex and the native SFTI-1-trypsin complex are surprisingly small and reveal the key role of the carbonyl group of the Ser214 residue of the enzyme, which is crucial for binding of the inhibitor and plays a crucial role in proteolysis mediated by serine proteases. The incorporated NLys5 peptoid residue prevents Ser214 from forming a hydrogen bond to the P1 residue, and in turn Gln192 does not form a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group of the P2 residue. It also increases the distance between the Ser214 carbonyl group and the Ser195 residue, thus preventing proteolysis. The hybrid inhibitor structure reported here provides insight into protein-protein interaction, which can be efficiently and selectively probed with the use of peptoids incorporated within endogenous peptide ligands. </p>

<p>The three-dimensional structure of the serine protease subtilisin BPN' (SBT) has been refined at 1.6 A resolution in space group C2 to a final R value of 0.17. 17 regions of discrete disorder have been identified and analyzed. Two of these are dual-conformation peptide units; the remainder involve alternate rotamers of side chains either alone or in small clusters. The structure is compared with previously reported high-resolution models of SBT in two other space groups, P2(1)2(1)2(1) and P2(1). Apart from the surface, there are no significant variations in structure among the three crystal forms. Structural variations observed at the protein surface occur predominantly in regions of protein-protein contact. The crystal packing arrangements in the three space groups are compared.</p>

<p>Vertebrate collagenases, members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, initiate interstitial fibrillar collagen breakdown. It is essential in many biological processes, and unbalanced collagenolysis is associated with diseases such as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, aneurysm, and fibrosis. These metalloproteinases are secreted from the cell as inactive precursors, procollagenases (proMMPs). To gain insights into the structural basis of their activation mechanisms and collagen binding, we have crystallized recombinant human proMMP-1 and determined its structure to 2.2 A resolution. The catalytic metalloproteinase domain and the C-terminal hemopexin (Hpx) domain show the classical MMP-fold, but the structure has revealed new features in surface loops and domain interaction. The prodomain is formed by a three-helix bundle and gives insight into the stepwise activation mechanism of proMMP-1. The prodomain interacts with the Hpx domain, which affects the position of the Hpx domain relative to the catalytic domain. This interaction results in a "closed" configuration of proMMP-1 in contrast to the "open" configuration observed previously for the structure of active MMP-1. This is the first evidence of mobility of the Hpx domain in relation to the catalytic domain, providing an important clue toward the understanding of the collagenase-collagen interaction and subsequent collagenolysis.</p>

<p>During the past two years, crystal structures of Cu- and Mo-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) and Ni- and Fe-containing CODHs have been reported. The active site of CODHs from anaerobic bacteria (cluster C) is composed of Ni, Fe, and S for which crystallographic studies of the enzymes from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans, Rhodospirillum rubrum, and Moorella thermoaceticarevealed structural similarities in the overall protein fold but showed substantial differences in the essential Ni coordination environment. The [Ni-4Fe-5S] cluster C in the fully catalytically competent dithionite-reduced CODH II from C. hydrogenoformans (CODHII(Ch)) at 1.6 A resolution contains a characteristic mu(2)-sulfido ligand between Ni and Fe1, resulting in a square-planar ligand arrangement with four S-ligands at the Ni ion. In contrast, the [Ni-4Fe-4S] clusters C in CO-treated CODH from R. rubrum resolved at 2.8 A and in CO-treated acetyl-CoA synthase/CODH complex from M. thermoacetica at 2.2 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively, do not contain the mu(2)-sulfido ligand between Ni and Fe1 and display dissimilar geometries at the Ni ion. The [Ni-4Fe-4S] cluster is composed of a cubane [Ni-3Fe-4S] cluster linked to a mononuclear Fe site. The described coordination geometries of the Ni ion in the [Ni-4Fe-4S] cluster of R. rubrum and M. thermoacetica deviate from the square-planar ligand geometry in the [Ni-4Fe-5S] cluster C of CODHII(Ch). In addition, the latter was converted into a [Ni-4Fe-4S] cluster under specific conditions. The objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the structure of cluster C in CODHII(Ch) and the functionality of the protein. We have determined the CO oxidation activity of CODHII(Ch) under different conditions of crystallization, prepared crystals of the enzyme in the presence of dithiothreitol or dithionite as reducing agents under an atmosphere of N(2) or CO, and solved the corresponding structures at 1.1 to 1.6 A resolutions. Fully active CODHII(Ch) obtained after incubation of the enzyme with dithionite under N(2) revealed the [Ni-4Fe-5S] cluster. Short treatment of the enzyme with CO in the presence of dithiothreitol resulted in a catalytically competent CODHII(Ch) with a CO-reduced [Ni-4Fe-5S] cluster, but a prolonged treatment with CO caused the loss of CO-oxidizing activity and revealed a [Ni-4Fe-4S] cluster, which did not contain a mu(2)-S. These data suggest that the [Ni-4Fe-4S] cluster of CODHII(Ch) is an inactivated decomposition product originating from the [Ni-4Fe-5S] cluster.</p>

<p>We report a strategy based on bioisosterism to improve the physicochemical properties of existing hydrophilic, urea-based GCPII inhibitors. Comprehensive structure-activity relationship studies of the P1' site of ZJ-43- and DCIBzL-based compounds identified several glutamate-free inhibitors with K(i) values below 20nM. Among them, compound 32d (K(i)=11nM) exhibited selective uptake in GCPII-expressing tumors by SPECT-CT imaging in mice. A novel conformational change of amino acids in the S1' pharmacophore pocket was observed in the X-ray crystal structure of GCPII complexed with 32d.</p>

<p>The discovery of a distinct metabolic pathway, the non-mevalonate or 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway for isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis, in eubacteria and apicomplexan parasites has revealed a new set of potential drug targets. The emphasis of research on this pathway has been on delineating the intermediates and the biochemical and structural characterization of component enzymes. Two new monoclinic crystal forms of recombinant Escherichia coli 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECP) synthase cocrystallized with (i) CMP and (ii) CMP and MECP show well defined electron density at the subunit interface suggestive of an isoprenoid-like ligand. 31P NMR analysis of the recombinant protein sample indicates the presence of bound diphosphate species and electrospray mass spectrometry identifies a mixture of isopentenyl diphosphate (and/or dimethylallyl diphosphate), geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate in an approximate ratio of 1:4:2. The most prevalent species, geranyl diphosphate, was successfully modelled into the electron density, revealing the important protein-ligand interactions that stabilize binding of the isoprenoid. The observation that MECP synthase binds three metabolites that are produced by enzymes two, three and four stages downstream in isoprenoid biosynthesis suggests that feedback regulation of the non-mevalonate pathway is possible.</p>

<p>Human DNA polymerase-iota (Poliota) incorporates correct nucleotides opposite template purines with a much higher efficiency and fidelity than opposite template pyrimidines. In fact, the fidelity opposite template T is so poor that Poliota inserts an incorrect dGTP approximately 10 times better than it inserts the correct dATP. We determine here how a template T/U is accommodated in the Poliota active site and why a G is incorporated more efficiently than an A. We show that in the absence of incoming dATP or dGTP (binary complex), template T/U exists in both syn and anti conformations, but in the presence of dATP or dGTP (ternary complexes), template T/U is predominantly in the anti conformation. We also show that dATP and dGTP insert differently opposite template T/U, and that the basis of selection of dGTP over dATP is a hydrogen bond between the N2 amino group of dGTP and Gln59 of Poliota.</p>

<p>Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease affecting over 200 million people currently treated with one drug, praziquantel. A possible drug target is the seleno-protein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (TGR), a key enzyme in the pathway of the parasite for detoxification of reactive oxygen species. The enzyme is a unique fusion of a glutaredoxin domain with a thioredoxin reductase domain, which contains a selenocysteine (Sec) as the penultimate amino acid. Auranofin (AF), a gold-containing compound already in clinical use as an anti-arthritic drug, has been shown to inhibit TGR and to substantially reduce worm burden in mice. Using x-ray crystallography we solved (at 2.5 A resolution) the structure of wild type TGR incubated with AF. The electron density maps show that the actual inhibitor is gold, released from AF. Gold is bound at three different sites not directly involving the C-terminal Sec residue; however, because the C terminus in the electron density maps is disordered, we cannot exclude the possibility that gold may also bind to Sec. To investigate the possible role of Sec in the inactivation kinetics, we tested the effect of AF on a model enzyme of the same superfamily, i.e. the naturally Sec-lacking glutathione reductase, and on truncated TGR. We demonstrate that the role of selenium in the onset of inhibition by AF is catalytic and can be mimicked by an external source of selenium (benzeneselenol). Therefore, we propose that Sec mediates the transfer of gold from its ligands in AF to the redox-active Cys couples of TGR.</p>

<p>Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.</p>

<p>Besides Onconase (ONC) and its V11/N20/R103-variant, oocytes of the Northern Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) contain another homologue of ribonuclease A, which we named Amphinase (Amph). Four variants (Amph-1-4) were isolated and sequenced, each 114 amino acid residues in length and N-glycosylated at two positions. Sequence identities (a) among the variants and (b) versus ONC are 86.8-99.1% and 38.2-40.0%, respectively. When compared with other amphibian ribonucleases, a typical pattern of cysteine residues is evident but the N-terminal pyroglutamate residue is replaced by a six-residue extension. Amph variants have relatively weak ribonucleolytic activity that is insensitive to human ribonuclease inhibitor protein (RI). Values of k(cat)/K(M) with hypersensitive fluorogenic substrates are 10(4) and 10(2)-fold lower than the maximum values exhibited by ribonuclease A and ONC, respectively, and there is little cytosine/uracil or adenine/guanine discrimination at the B(1) or B(2) subsites, respectively. Amph variants have cytotoxic activity toward A-253 carcinoma cells that requires intact ribonucleolytic activity. The glycan component has little or no influence over single-stranded RNA cleavage, RI evasion or cytotoxicity. The crystal structures of natural and recombinant Amph-2 (determined at 1.8 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively) reveal that the N terminus is unlikely to play a catalytic role (but an unusual alpha2-beta1 loop may do so) and the B(2) subsite is rudimentary. At the active site, structural features that may contribute to the enzyme's low ribonucleolytic activity are the fixture of Lys14 in an obstructive position, the accompanying ejection of Lys42, and a lack of constraints on the conformations of Lys42 and His107.</p>

<p>The bacterial phosphotriesterase has been utilized as a template for the evolution of improved enzymes for the catalytic decomposition of organophosphate nerve agents. A combinatorial library of active site mutants was constructed by randomizing residues His-254, His-257, and Leu-303. The collection of mutant proteins was screened for the ability to hydrolyze a chromogenic analogue of the most toxic stereoisomer of the chemical warfare agent, soman. The mutant H254G/H257W/L303T catalyzed the hydrolysis of the target substrate nearly 3 orders of magnitude faster than the wild-type enzyme. The X-ray crystal structure was solved in the presence and absence of diisopropyl methyl phosphonate. The mutant enzyme was ligated to an additional divalent cation at the active site that was displaced upon the binding of the substrate analogue inhibitor. These studies demonstrate that substantial changes in substrate specificity can be achieved by relatively minor changes to the primary amino acid sequence.</p>

<p>Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.</p>

<p>Plasmodium falciparum thymidylate kinase (PfTMPK) is a key enzyme in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-chloro-phenyl-urea-α-thymidine has been reported as an inhibitor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis TMPK (MtTMPK). Starting from this point, we designed, synthesized and evaluated a number of thymidine analogues as antimalarials. Both 5'-urea-α- and β-thymidine derivatives were moderate inhibitors of PfTMPK and furthermore showed moderate inhibition of parasite growth. The structure of several enzyme-inhibitor complexes provides a basis for improved inhibitor design. However, we found that certain 5'-urea-α-thymidine analogues had antimalarial activity where inhibition of PfTMPK is not the major mode of action. Optimization of this series resulted in a compound with potent antimalarial activity (EC(50) = 28 nM; CC(50) = 29 μM).</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Escherichia coli ketopantoate reductase in complex with 2'-monophosphoadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose, a fragment of NADP+ that lacks the nicotinamide ring, is reported. The ligand is bound at the enzyme active site in the opposite orientation to that observed for NADP+, with the adenine ring occupying the lipophilic nicotinamide pocket. Isothermal titration calorimetry with R31A and N98A mutants of the enzyme is used to show that the unusual ;reversed binding mode' observed in the crystal is triggered by changes in the protonation of binding groups at low pH. This research has important implications for fragment-based approaches to drug design, namely that the crystallization conditions and the chemical modification of ligands can have unexpected effects on the binding modes.</p>

<p>The catalytic efficiency of the class D beta-lactamase OXA-10 depends critically on an unusual carboxylated lysine as the general base residue for both the enzyme acylation and deacylation steps of catalysis. Evidence is presented that the interaction between the indole group of Trp154 and the carboxylated lysine is essential for the stability of the posttranslationally modified Lys70. Substitution of Trp154 by Gly, Ala, or Phe yielded noncarboxylated enzymes which displayed poor catalytic efficiencies and reduced stability when compared to the wild-type OXA-10. The W154H mutant was partially carboxylated. In addition, the maximum values of k(cat) and k(cat)/K(M) were shifted toward pH 7, indicating that the carboxylation state of Lys70 is dependent on the protonation level of the histidine. A comparison of the three-dimensional structures of the different proteins also indicated that the Trp154 mutations did not modify the overall structures of OXA-10 but induced an increased flexibility of the Omega-loop in the active site. Finally, the deacylation-impaired W154A mutant was used to determine the structure of the acyl-enzyme complex with benzylpenicillin. These results indicate a role of the Lys70 carboxylation during the deacylation step and emphasize the importance of Trp154 for the ideal positioning of active site residues leading to an optimum activity.</p>

<p>Phospholipases D (PLDs) are principally responsible for the local and systemic effects of Loxosceles envenomation including dermonecrosis and hemolysis. Despite their clinical relevance in loxoscelism, to date, only the SMase I from Loxosceles laeta, a class I member, has been structurally characterized. The crystal structure of a class II member from Loxosceles intermedia venom has been determined at 1.7Å resolution. Structural comparison to the class I member showed that the presence of an additional disulphide bridge which links the catalytic loop to the flexible loop significantly changes the volume and shape of the catalytic cleft. An examination of the crystal structures of PLD homologues in the presence of low molecular weight compounds at their active sites suggests the existence of a ligand-dependent rotamer conformation of the highly conserved residue Trp230 (equivalent to Trp192 in the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase from Thermus thermophofilus, PDB code: 1VD6) indicating its role in substrate binding in both enzymes. Sequence and structural analyses suggest that the reduced sphingomyelinase activity observed in some class IIb PLDs is probably due to point mutations which lead to a different substrate preference.</p>

<p>The most important mode of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics is the expression of beta-lactamases. New cyclobutanone analogues of penams and penems have been prepared and evaluated for inhibition of class A, B, C, and D beta-lactamases. Inhibitors which favor conformations in which the C4 carboxylate is equatorial were found to be more potent than those in which the carboxylate is axial, and molecular modeling studies with enzyme-inhibitor complexes indicate that an equatorial orientation of the carboxylate is required for binding to beta-lactamases. An X-ray structure of OXA-10 complexed with a cyclobutanone confirms that a serine hemiketal is formed in the active site and that the inhibitor adopts the exo envelope. An unsaturated penem analogue was also found to enhance the potency of meropenem against carbapenem-resistant MBL-producing strains of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. These cyclobutanones represent the first type of reversible inhibitors to show moderate (low micromolar) inhibition of both serine- and metallo-beta-lactamases and should be considered for further development into practical inhibitors.</p>

<p>Guanine deaminases (GDs) are important enzymes involved in purine metabolism as well as nucleotide anabolism pathways that exhibit a high degree of fidelity. Here, the structural basis of the substrate specificity of GDs was investigated by determining a series of X-ray structures of NE0047 (GD from Nitrosomonas europaea) with nucleobase analogues and nucleosides. The structures demonstrated that the interactions in the GD active site are tailor-made to accommodate only guanine and any substitutions in the purine ring or introduction of a pyrimidine ring results in rearrangement of the bases in a catalytically unfavorable orientation, away from the proton shuttling residue E143. In addition, X-ray structural studies performed on cytidine revealed that although it binds in an optimal conformation, its deamination does not occur because of the inability of the enzyme to orchestrate the closure of the catalytically important C-terminal loop (residues 181-189). Isothermal calorimetry measurements established that these nucleoside moieties also disrupt the sequential mode of ligand binding, thereby abrogating all intersubunit communication. Intriguingly, it was recently discovered that GDs can also serve as endogenous ammeline deaminases, although it is structurally nonhomologous with guanine. To understand the mechanism of dual-substrate specificity, the structure of NE0047 in complex with ammeline was determined to a resolution of 2.7 Å. The structure revealed that ammeline not only fits in the active site in a catalytically favorable orientation but also allows for closure of the C-terminal loop. </p>

<p>The oncogenic corepressors C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP) 1 and 2 harbor regulatory d-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (d2-HDH) domains. 4-Methylthio 2-oxobutyric acid (MTOB) exhibits substrate inhibition and can interfere with CtBP oncogenic activity in cell culture and mice. Crystal structures of human CtBP1 and CtBP2 in complex with MTOB and NAD<sup>+</sup> revealed two key features: a conserved tryptophan that likely contributes to substrate specificity and a hydrophilic cavity that links MTOB with an NAD<sup>+</sup> phosphate. Neither feature is present in other d2-HDH enzymes. These structures thus offer key opportunities for the development of highly selective anti-neoplastic CtBP inhibitors.</p>

<p>Endonuclease V (EndoV) initiates a major base-repair pathway for nitrosative deamination resulting from endogenous processes and increased by oxidative stress from mitochondrial dysfunction or inflammatory responses. We solved the crystal structures of Thermotoga maritima EndoV in complex with a hypoxanthine lesion substrate and with product DNA. The PYIP wedge motif acts as a minor groove-damage sensor for helical distortions and base mismatches and separates DNA strands at the lesion. EndoV incises DNA with an unusual offset nick 1 nucleotide 3' of the lesion, as the deaminated adenine is rotated approximately 90 degrees into a recognition pocket approximately 8 A from the catalytic site. Tight binding by the lesion-recognition pocket in addition to Mg(2+) and hydrogen-bonding interactions to the DNA ends stabilize the product complex, suggesting an orderly recruitment of downstream proteins in this base-repair pathway.</p>

<p>Rhodobacter capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is an (alphabeta)(2) heterotetrameric cytoplasmic enzyme that resembles eukaryotic xanthine oxidoreductases in respect to both amino acid sequence and structural fold. To obtain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of substrate and inhibitor binding at the active site, we solved crystal structures of R. capsulatus XDH in the presence of its substrates hypoxanthine, xanthine, and the inhibitor pterin-6-aldehyde using either the inactive desulfo form of the enzyme or an active site mutant (E(B)232Q) to prevent substrate turnover. The hypoxanthine- and xanthine-bound structures reveal the orientation of both substrates at the active site and show the importance of residue Glu(B)-232 for substrate positioning. The oxygen atom at the C-6 position of both substrates is oriented toward Arg(B)-310 in the active site. Thus the substrates bind in an orientation opposite to the one seen in the structure of the reduced enzyme with the inhibitor oxypurinol. The tightness of the substrates in the active site suggests that the intermediate products must exit the binding pocket to allow first the attack of the C-2, followed by oxidation of the C-8 atom to form the final product uric acid. Structural studies of pterin-6-aldehyde, a potent inhibitor of R. capsulatus XDH, contribute further to the understanding of the relative positioning of inhibitors and substrates in the binding pocket. Steady state kinetics reveal a competitive inhibition pattern with a K(i) of 103.57 +/- 18.96 nm for pterin-6-aldehyde.</p>

<p>The understanding of transition state mimicry in glycoside hydrolysis is increasingly important both in the quest for novel specific therapeutic agents and for the deduction of enzyme function and mechanism. To aid comprehension, inhibitors can be characterized through kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural dissection to build an "inhibition profile." Here we dissect the binding of a tetrahydrooxazine inhibitor and its derivatives, which display Ki values around 500 nm. X-ray structures with both a beta-glucosidase, at 2 A resolution, and an endoglucanase at atomic (approximately 1 A) resolution reveal similar interactions between the tetrahydrooxazine inhibitor and both enzymes. Kinetic analyses reveal the pH dependence of kcat/Km and 1/Ki with both enzyme systems, and isothermal titration calorimetry unveils the enthalpic and entropic contributions to beta-glucosidase inhibition. The pH dependence of enzyme activity mirrored that of 1/Ki in both enzymes, unlike the cases of isofagomine and 1-deoxynojirimycin that have been characterized previously. Calorimetric dissection reveals a large favorable enthalpy that is partially offset by an unfavorable entropy upon binding. In terms of the similar profile for the pH dependence of 1/Ki and the pH dependence of kcat/Km, the significant enthalpy of binding when compared with other glycosidase inhibitors, and the tight binding at the optimal pH of the enzymes tested, tetrahydrooxazine and its derivatives are a significantly better class of glycosidase inhibitor than previously assumed.</p>

<p>The 1,3(4)-beta-D-glucanases of glycoside hydrolase family 16 provide useful examples of versatile yet specific protein-carbohydrate interactions. In the present study, we report the X-ray structures of the 1,3(4)-beta-D-glucanase Phanerochaete chrysosporium Laminarinase 16A in complex with beta-glucan products from laminarin (1.6 A) and lichenin (1.1 A) hydrolysis. The G6G3G3G glucan, in complex with the enzyme, showed a beta-1,6 branch in the acceptor site. The G4G3G ligand-protein complex showed that there was no room for a beta-1,6 branch in the -1 or -2 subsites; furthermore, the distorted residue in the -1 subsite and the glucose in the -2 subsite required a beta-1,3 bond between them. These are the first X-ray crystal structures of any 1,3(4)-beta-D-glucanase in complex with glucan products. They provide details of both substrate and product binding in support of earlier enzymatic evidence.</p>

<p>The hyperthermophilic Archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus grows optimally above 80 degrees C and metabolizes glucose by a non-phosphorylative variant of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. In this pathway glucose dehydrogenase and gluconate dehydratase catalyze the oxidation of glucose to gluconate and the subsequent dehydration of gluconate to D-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG). KDG aldolase (KDGA) then catalyzes the cleavage of KDG to D-glyceraldehyde and pyruvate. It has recently been shown that all the enzymes of this pathway exhibit a catalytic promiscuity that also enables them to be used for the metabolism of galactose. This phenomenon, known as metabolic pathway promiscuity, depends crucially on the ability of KDGA to cleave KDG and D-2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate (KDGal), in both cases producing pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde. In turn, the aldolase exhibits a remarkable lack of stereoselectivity in the condensation reaction of pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde, forming a mixture of KDG and KDGal. We now report the structure of KDGA, determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing, and confirm that it is a member of the tetrameric N-acetylneuraminate lyase superfamily of Schiff base-forming aldolases. Furthermore, by soaking crystals of the aldolase at more than 80 degrees C below its temperature activity optimum, we have been able to trap Schiff base complexes of the natural substrates pyruvate, KDG, KDGal, and pyruvate plus D-glyceraldehyde, which have allowed rationalization of the structural basis of promiscuous substrate recognition and catalysis. It is proposed that the active site of the enzyme is rigid to keep its thermostability but incorporates extra functionality to be promiscuous.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the vitamin B(6)-dependent enzyme phosphoserine aminotransferase from the obligatory alkaliphile Bacillus alcalophilus has been determined at 1.08 A resolution. The model was refined to an R-factor of 11.7% (R(free) = 13.9%). The enzyme displays a narrow pH optimum of enzymatic activity at pH 9.0. The final structure was compared to the previously reported structure of the mesophilic phosphoserine aminotransferase from Escherichia coli and to that of phosphoserine aminotransferase from a facultative alkaliphile, Bacillus circulans subsp. alkalophilus. All three enzymes are homodimers with each monomer comprising a two-domain architecture. Despite the high structural similarity, the alkaliphilic representatives possess a set of distinctive structural features. Two residues directly interacting with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate are replaced, and an additional hydrogen bond to the O3' atom of the cofactor is present in alkaliphilic phosphoserine aminotransferases. The number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface is increased. Hydrophobic interactions between the two domains in the monomers are enhanced. Moreover, the number of negatively charged amino acid residues increases on the solvent-accessible molecular surface and fewer hydrophobic residues are exposed to the solvent. Further, the total amount of ion pairs and ion networks is significantly reduced in the Bacillus enzymes, while the total number of hydrogen bonds is increased. The mesophilic enzyme from Escherichia coli contains two additional beta-strands in a surface loop with a third beta-strand being shorter in the structure. The identified structural features are proposed to be possible factors implicated in the alkaline adaptation of phosphoserine aminotransferase.</p>

<p>Selenocysteine (Sec) is translationally incorporated into proteins in response to the UGA codon. The tRNA specific to Sec (tRNA(Sec)) is first ligated with serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS). In the present study, we determined the 3.1 Å crystal structure of the tRNA(Sec) from the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, in complex with the heterologous SerRS from the archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri. The bacterial tRNA(Sec) assumes the L-shaped structure, from which the long extra arm protrudes. Although the D-arm conformation and the extra-arm orientation are similar to those of eukaryal/archaeal tRNA(Sec)s, A. aeolicus tRNA(Sec) has unique base triples, G14:C21:U8 and C15:G20a:G48, which occupy the positions corresponding to the U8:A14 and R15:Y48 tertiary base pairs of canonical tRNAs. Methanopyrus kandleri SerRS exhibited serine ligation activity toward A. aeolicus tRNA(Sec) in vitro. The SerRS N-terminal domain interacts with the extra-arm stem and the outer corner of tRNA(Sec). Similar interactions exist in the reported tRNA(Ser) and SerRS complex structure from the bacterium Thermus thermophilus. Although the catalytic C-terminal domain of M. kandleri SerRS lacks interactions with A. aeolicus tRNA(Sec) in the present complex structure, the conformational flexibility of SerRS is likely to allow the CCA terminal region of tRNA(Sec) to enter the SerRS catalytic site. </p>

<p>The X-ray structure of the enzyme 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) from yeast complexed with the competitive inhibitor 5-hydroxylaevulinic acid has been determined at a resolution of 1.9 A. The structure shows that the inhibitor is bound by a Schiff-base link to one of the invariant active-site lysine residues (Lys263). The inhibitor appears to bind in two well defined conformations and the interactions made by it suggest that it is a very close analogue of the substrate 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA).</p>

<p>Pnkp is the end-healing and end-sealing component of an RNA repair system present in diverse bacteria from many phyla. Pnkp is composed of three catalytic modules: an N-terminal polynucleotide 5' kinase, a central 2',3' phosphatase and a C-terminal ligase. The phosphatase module is a Mn(2+)-dependent phosphodiesterase-monoesterase that dephosphorylates 2',3'-cyclic phosphate RNA ends. Here we report the crystal structure of the phosphatase domain of Clostridium thermocellum Pnkp with Mn(2+) and citrate in the active site. The protein consists of a core binuclear metallo-phosphoesterase fold (exemplified by bacteriophage λ phosphatase) embellished by distinctive secondary structure elements. The active site contains a single Mn(2+) in an octahedral coordination complex with Asp187, His189, Asp233, two citrate oxygens and a water. The citrate fills the binding site for the scissile phosphate, wherein it is coordinated by Arg237, Asn263 and His264. The citrate invades the site normally occupied by a second metal (engaged by Asp233, Asn263, His323 and His376), and thereby dislocates His376. A continuous tract of positive surface potential flanking the active site suggests an RNA binding site. The structure illuminates a large body of mutational data regarding the metal and substrate specificity of Clostridium thermocellum Pnkp phosphatase.</p>

<p>The structure of recombinant Aquifex aeolicus UDP-3-O-acyl-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC) in complex with UDP has been determined to a resolution of 2.2 A. Previous studies have characterized the binding sites of the fatty-acid and sugar moieties of the substrate, UDP-(3-O-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine, but not that of the nucleotide. The uracil-binding site is constructed from amino acids that are highly conserved across species. Hydrophobic associations with the Phe155 and Arg250 side chains in combination with hydrogen-bonding interactions with the main chain of Glu154 and the side chains of Tyr151 and Lys227 position the base. The phosphate and ribose groups are directed away from the active site and interact with Arg137, Lys156, Glu186 and Arg250. The orientation of the phosphate-ribose tail is not conducive to catalysis, perhaps owing to the position of an inhibitory Zn(2+). However, based on the position of uracil revealed in this study and on the previously reported complex of LpxC with an inhibitor, a model is proposed for substrate binding.</p>

<p>The understanding of the mechanism of enzymatic recovery of NADH is of biological and of considerable biotechnological interest, since the essential, but expensive, cofactor NADH is exhausted in asymmetric hydrogenation processes, but can be recovered by NAD(+)-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH). Most accepted for this purpose is the FDH from the yeast Candida boidinii (CbFDH), which, having relatively low thermostability and specific activity, has been targeted by enzyme engineering for several years. Optimization by mutagenesis studies was performed based on physiological studies and structure modeling. However, X-ray structural information has been required in order to clarify the enzymatic mechanism and to enhance the effectiveness and operational stability of enzymatic cofactor regenerators in biocatalytic enantiomer synthesis as well as to explain the observed biochemical differences between yeast and bacterial FDH. We designed two single-point mutants in CbFDH using an adapted surface engineering approach, and this allowed crystals suitable for high-resolution X-ray structural studies to be obtained. The mutations improved the crystallizability of the protein and also the catalytic properties and the stability of the enzyme. With these crystal structures, we explain the observed differences from both sources, and form the basis for further rational mutagenesis studies.</p>

<p>Sorbitol dehydrogenase (hSDH) and aldose reductase form the polyol pathway that interconverts glucose and fructose. Redox changes from overproduction of the coenzyme NADH by SDH may play a role in diabetes-induced dysfunction in sensitive tissues, making SDH a therapeutic target for diabetic complications. We have purified and determined the crystal structures of human SDH alone, SDH with NAD(+), and SDH with NADH and an inhibitor that is competitive with fructose. hSDH is a tetramer of identical, catalytically active subunits. In the apo and NAD(+) complex, the catalytic zinc is coordinated by His69, Cys44, Glu70, and a water molecule. The inhibitor coordinates the zinc through an oxygen and a nitrogen atom with the concomitant dissociation of Glu70. The inhibitor forms hydrophobic interactions to NADH and likely sterically occludes substrate binding. The structure of the inhibitor complex provides a framework for developing more potent inhibitors of hSDH.</p>

<p>Malyl-CoA lyase (MCL) is a promiscuous carbon-carbon bond lyase that catalyzes the reversible cleavage of structurally related Coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters. This enzyme plays a crucial, multifunctional role in the 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle for autotrophic CO2 fixation in Chloroflexus aurantiacus. A second, phylogenetically distinct MCL from Rhodobacter sphaeroides is involved in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for acetate assimilation. Both MCLs belong to the large superfamily of CitE-like enzymes, which includes the name-giving β-subunit of citrate lyase (CitE), malyl-CoA thioesterases and other enzymes of unknown physiological function. The CitE-like enzyme superfamily also bears sequence and structural resemblance to the malate synthases. All of these different enzymes share highly conserved catalytic residues, although they catalyze distinctly different reactions: C-C bond formation and cleavage, thioester hydrolysis, or both (the malate synthases).</p>

<p>Alpha-glucuronidases cleave the alpha-1,2-glycosidic bond between 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid and short xylooligomers as part of the hemicellulose degradation system. To date, all of the alpha-glucuronidases are classified as family 67 glycosidases, which catalyze the hydrolysis via the investing mechanism. Here we describe several high resolution crystal structures of the alpha-glucuronidase (AguA) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, in complex with its substrate and products. In the complex of AguA with the intact substrate, the 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid sugar ring is distorted into a half-chair conformation, which is closer to the planar conformation required for the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state structure. In the active site, a water molecule is coordinated between two carboxylic acids, in an appropriate position to act as a nucleophile. From the structural data it is likely that two carboxylic acids, Asp(364) and Glu(392), activate together the nucleophilic water molecule. The loop carrying the catalytic general acid Glu(285) cannot be resolved in some of the structures but could be visualized in its "open" and "closed" (catalytic) conformations in other structures. The protonated state of Glu(285) is presumably stabilized by its proximity to the negative charge of the substrate, representing a new variation of substrate-assisted catalysis mechanism.</p>

<p>myo-Inositol dehydrogenase (IDH, EC 1.1.1.18) from Bacillus subtilis converts myo-inositol to scyllo-inosose and is strictly dependent on NAD for activity. We sought to alter the coenzyme specificity to generate an NADP-dependent enzyme in order to enhance our understanding of coenzyme selectivity and to create an enzyme capable of recycling NADP in biocatalytic processes. Examination of available structural information related to the GFO/MocA/IDH family of dehydrogenases and precedents for altering coenzyme selectivity allowed us to select residues for substitution, and nine single, double, and triple mutants were constructed. Mutagenesis experiments with B. subtilis IDH proved extremely successful; the double mutant D35S/V36R preferred NADP to NAD by a factor of 5. This mutant is an excellent catalyst with a second-order rate constant with respect to NADP of 370 000 s⁻¹ M⁻¹, and the triple mutant A12K/D35S/V36R had a value of 570 000 s⁻¹ M⁻¹, higher than that of the wild-type IDH with NAD. The high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the double mutant A12K/D35S was solved in complex with NADP. Surprisingly, the binding of the coenzyme is altered such that although the nicotinamide ring maintains the required position for catalysis, the coenzyme has twisted by nearly 90°, so the adenine moiety no longer binds to a hydrophobic cleft in the Rossmann fold as in the wild-type enzyme. This change in binding conformation has not previously been observed in mutated dehydrogenases.</p>

<p>We have solved the 1.55 A crystal structure of the anion-assisted dimer of porcine pancreatic group IB phospholipase A2 (PLA2), complexed with the products of hydrolysis of the substrate platelet activating factor. The dimer contains five coplanar phosphate anions bound at the contact surface between the two PLA2 subunits. This structure parallels a previously reported anion-assisted dimer that mimics the tetrahedral intermediate of PLA2 bound to a substrate interface [Pan, Y. H., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 609-617]. The dimer structure has a molecule of the product acetate bound in subunit A and the other product 1-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LPC-ether) to subunit B. Therefore, this structure is of the two individual product binary complexes and not of a ternary complex with both products in one active site of PLA2. Protein crystals with bound products were only obtained by cocrystallization starting from the initial substrate. In contrast, an alternate crystal form was obtained when PLA2 was cocrystallized with LPC-ether and succinate, and this crystal form did not contain bound products. The product bound structure has acetate positioned in the catalytic site of subunit A such that one of its oxygen atoms is located 3.5 A from the catalytic calcium. Likewise, a longer than typical Ca-to-Gly(32) carbonyl distance of 3.4 A results in a final Ca coordination that is four-coordinate and has distorted geometry. The other oxygen of acetate makes hydrogen bonds with N(delta)(1)-His(48), O(delta)(1)-Asp(49), and the catalytic assisting water (w7). In contrast, the glycerophosphocholine headgroup of LPC-ether in subunit B makes no contacts with calcium or with the catalytic residues His(48) or Asp(49). The tail of the LPC-ether is located near the active site pocket with the last nine carbons of the sn-1- acyl chain refined in two alternate conformations. The remaining atoms of the LPC-ether product have been modeled into the solvent channel but have their occupancies set to zero in the refined model due to disorder. Together, the crystallographic and equilibrium binding results with the two products show that the simultaneous binding of both the products in a single active site is not favored.</p>

<p>Pyrroloquinoline quinone [4,5-dihydro-4,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-f]quinoline-2,7,9-tricarboxylic acid (PQQ)] is a bacterial cofactor in numerous alcohol dehydrogenases including methanol dehydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase. Its biosynthesis in Klebsiella pneumoniae is facilitated by six genes, pqqABCDEF and proceeds by an unknown pathway. PqqC is one of two metal free oxidases of known structure and catalyzes the last step of PQQ biogenesis which involves a ring closure and an eight-electron oxidation of the substrate [3a-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-4,5-dioxo-4,5,6,7,8,9-hexahydroquinoline-7,9-dicarboxylic acid (AHQQ)]. PqqC has 14 conserved active site residues, which have previously been shown to be in close contact with bound PQQ. Herein, we describe the structures of three PqqC active site variants, H154S, Y175F, and the double mutant R179S/Y175S. The H154S crystal structure shows that, even with PQQ bound, the enzyme is still in the "open" conformation with helices alpha5b and alpha6 unfolded and the active site solvent accessible. The Y175F PQQ complex crystal structure reveals the closed conformation indicating that Y175 is not required for the conformational change. The R179S/Y175S AHQQ complex crystal structure is the most mechanistically informative, indicating an open conformation with a reaction intermediate trapped in the active site. The intermediate seen in R179S/Y175S is tricyclic but nonplanar, implying that it has not undergone oxidation. These studies implicate a stepwise process in which substrate binding leads to the generation of the closed protein conformation, with the latter playing a critical role in O(2) binding and catalysis.</p>

<p>Non-coding apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA form spontaneously and as DNA base excision repair intermediates are the most common toxic and mutagenic in vivo DNA lesion. For repair, AP sites must be processed by 5' AP endonucleases in initial stages of base repair. Human APE1 and bacterial Nfo represent the two conserved 5' AP endonuclease families in the biosphere; they both recognize AP sites and incise the phosphodiester backbone 5' to the lesion, yet they lack similar structures and metal ion requirements. Here, we determined and analyzed crystal structures of a 2.4 Å resolution APE1-DNA product complex with Mg(2+) and a 0.92 Å Nfo with three metal ions. Structural and biochemical comparisons of these two evolutionarily distinct enzymes characterize key APE1 catalytic residues that are potentially functionally similar to Nfo active site components, as further tested and supported by computational analyses. We observe a magnesium-water cluster in the APE1 active site, with only Glu-96 forming the direct protein coordination to the Mg(2+). Despite differences in structure and metal requirements of APE1 and Nfo, comparison of their active site structures surprisingly reveals strong geometric conservation of the catalytic reaction, with APE1 catalytic side chains positioned analogously to Nfo metal positions, suggesting surprising functional equivalence between Nfo metal ions and APE1 residues. The finding that APE1 residues are positioned to substitute for Nfo metal ions is supported by the impact of mutations on activity. Collectively, the results illuminate the activities of residues, metal ions, and active site features for abasic site endonucleases.</p>

<p>The 5beta-reductases (AKR1D1-3) are unique enzymes able to catalyze efficiently and in a stereospecific manner the 5beta-reduction of the C4-C5 double bond found into Delta4-3-ketosteroids, including steroid hormones and bile acids. Multiple-sequence alignments and mutagenic studies have already identified one of the residues presumably located at their active site, Glu 120, as the major molecular determinant for the unique activity displayed by 5beta-reductases. To define the exact role played by this glutamate in the catalytic activity of these enzymes, biochemical and structural studies on human 5beta-reductase (h5beta-red) have been undertaken. The crystal structure of h5beta-red in a ternary complex with NADP (+) and 5beta-dihydroprogesterone (5beta-DHP), the product of the 5beta-reduction of progesterone (Prog), revealed that Glu 120 does not interact directly with the other catalytic residues, as previously hypothesized, thus suggesting that this residue is not directly involved in catalysis but could instead be important for the proper positioning of the steroid substrate in the catalytic site. On the basis of our structural results, we thus propose a realistic scheme for the catalytic mechanism of the C4-C5 double bond reduction. We also propose that bile acid precursors such as 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, when bound to the active site of h5beta-red, can establish supplementary contacts with Tyr 26 and Tyr 132, two residues delineating the steroid-binding cavity. These additional contacts very likely account for the higher activity of h5beta-red toward the bile acid intermediates versus steroid hormones. Finally, in light of the structural data now available, we attempt to interpret the likely consequences of mutations already identified in the gene encoding the h5beta-red enzyme which lead to a reduction of its enzymatic activity and which can progress to severe liver function failure.</p>

<p>The bacterial phosphotriesterase (PTE) from Pseudomonas diminuta catalyzes the hydrolysis of organophosphate esters at rates close to the diffusion limit. X-ray diffraction studies have shown that a binuclear metal center is positioned in the active site of PTE and that this complex is responsible for the activation of the nucleophilic water from solvent. In this paper, the three-dimensional structure of PTE was determined in the presence of the hydrolysis product, diethyl phosphate (DEP), and a product analogue, cacodylate. In the structure of the PTE-diethyl phosphate complex, the DEP product is found symmetrically bridging the two divalent cations. The DEP displaces the hydroxide from solvent that normally bridges the two divalent cations in structures determined in the presence or absence of substrate analogues. One of the phosphoryl oxygen atoms in the PTE-DEP complex is 2.0 A from the alpha-metal ion, while the other oxygen is 2.2 A from the beta-metal ion. The two metal ions are separated by a distance of 4.0 A. A similar structure is observed in the presence of cacodylate. Analogous complexes have previously been observed for the product complexes of isoaspartyl dipeptidase, d-aminoacylase, and dihydroorotase from the amidohydrolase superfamily of enzymes. The experimentally determined structure of the PTE-diethyl phosphate product complex is inconsistent with a recent proposal based upon quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations which postulated the formation of an asymmetrical product complex bound exclusively to the beta-metal ion with a metal-metal separation of 5.3 A. This structure is also inconsistent with a chemical mechanism for substrate hydrolysis that utilizes the bridging hydroxide as a base to abstract a proton from a water molecule loosely associated with the alpha-metal ion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support a reaction mechanism that utilizes the bridging hydroxide as the direct nucleophile in the hydrolysis of organophosphate esters by PTE.</p>

<p>Human somatic angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase and a central component of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). Its involvement in the modulation of physiological actions of peptide hormones has positioned ACE as an important therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Here, we report the crystal structures of the two catalytic domains of human ACE (N- and C-) in complex with FI, the S enantiomer of the phosphinic ACE/ECE-1 (endothelin converting enzyme) dual inhibitor FII, to a resolution of 1.91 and 1.85 Å, respectively. In addition, we have determined the structure of AnCE (an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster) in complex with both isomers. The inhibitor FI (S configuration) can adapt to the active site of ACE catalytic domains and shows key differences in its binding mechanism mostly through the reorientation of the isoxazole phenyl side group at the P₁' position compared with FII (R configuration). Differences in binding are also observed between FI and FII in complex with AnCE. Thus, the new structures of the ACE-inhibitor complexes presented here provide useful information for further exploration of ACE inhibitor pharmacophores involving phosphinic peptides and illustrate the role of chirality in enhancing drug specificity.</p>

<p>N-Acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK), the paradigm enzyme of the amino acid kinase family, catalyzes the second step of arginine biosynthesis. Although substrate binding and catalysis were clarified by the determination of four crystal structures of the homodimeric Escherichia coli enzyme (EcNAGK), we now determine 2 A resolution crystal structures of EcNAGK free from substrates or complexed with the product N-acetyl-L-glutamyl-5-phosphate (NAGP) and with sulfate, which reveal a novel, very open NAGK conformation to which substrates would associate and from which products would dissociate. In this conformation, the C-domain, which hosts most of the nucleotide site, rotates approximately 24 degrees -28 degrees away from the N-domain, which hosts the acetylglutamate site, whereas the empty ATP site also exhibits some changes. One sulfate is found binding in the region where the beta-phosphate of ATP normally binds, suggesting that ATP is first anchored to the beta-phosphate site, before perfect binding by induced fit, triggering the shift to the closed conformation. In contrast, the acetylglutamate site is always well formed, although its beta-hairpin lid is found here to be mobile, being closed only in the subunit of the EcNAGK-NAGP complex that binds NAGP most strongly. Lid closure appears to increase the affinity for acetylglutamate/NAGP and to stabilize the closed enzyme conformation via lid-C-domain contacts. Our finding of NAGP bound to the open conformation confirms that this product dissociates from the open enzyme form and allows reconstruction of the active center in the ternary complex with both products, delineating the final steps of the reaction, which is shown here by site-directed mutagenesis to involve centrally the invariant residue Gly11.</p>

<p>Polypeptide deformylase (PDF) catalyzes the deformylation of polypeptide chains in bacteria. It is essential for bacterial cell viability and is a potential antibacterial drug target. Here, we report the crystal structures of polypeptide deformylase from four different species of bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Comparison of these four structures reveals significant overall differences between the two Gram-negative species (E. coli and H. influenzae) and the two Gram-positive species (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus). Despite these differences and low overall sequence identity, the S1' pocket of PDF is well conserved among the four enzymes studied. We also describe the binding of nonpeptidic inhibitor molecules SB-485345, SB-543668, and SB-505684 to both S. pneumoniae and E. coli PDF. Comparison of these structures shows similar binding interactions with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. Understanding the similarities and subtle differences in active site structure between species will help to design broad-spectrum polypeptide deformylase inhibitor molecules.</p>

<p>Protein C activation initiated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex forms the major physiological anticoagulant pathway. Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix protein C activator, a glycosylated single-chain serine proteinase, activates protein C without relying on thrombomodulin. The crystal structures of native and inhibited Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix protein C activator determined at 1.65 and 1.54 A resolutions, respectively, indicate the pivotal roles played by the positively charged belt and the strategic positioning of the three carbohydrate moieties surrounding the catalytic site in protein C recognition, binding, and activation. Structural changes in the benzamidine-inhibited enzyme suggest a probable function in allosteric regulation for the anion-binding site located in the C-terminal extension, which is fully conserved in snake venom serine proteinases, that preferentially binds Cl(1-) instead of SO(4)(2-).</p>

<p>The β-D-glucosidases from wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale) hydrolyze benzoxazinone-glucose conjugates. Although wheat and rye glucosidases have high sequence identity, they have different substrate preferences; the wheat enzyme favors DIMBOA-Glc (2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one) over DIBOA-Glc (7-demethoxy-DIMBOA-Glc), whereas the rye enzyme preference is the opposite. To investigate the mechanism of substrate binding, we analyzed crystal structures of an inactive mutant of the wheat glucosidase complexed with the natural substrate DIMBOA-Glc, wheat and rye glucosidases complexed with an aglycone DIMBOA, and wheat and rye glucosidases complexed with an inhibitor 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-β-D-glucose. The binding position of substrate in the active site was determined but interaction between the substrate and Ser-464 or Leu-465 was not observed, although amino acid residues at these two positions are the only structural distinctions between wheat and rye glucosidase catalytic pockets. Variation at these two positions alters the width of the pocket entrance, which may relate to observed differences in substrate specificity. The side chain of Glu-462 that forms hydrogen bonds with the glucose moiety of DIMBOA-Glc moved deeper into the pocket upon substrate binding, and mutation of this residue dramatically decreased enzyme activity.</p>

<p>A stable, non-peptide inhibitor of the protease from type 1 human immunodeficiency virus has been developed, and the stereochemistry of binding defined through crystallographic three-dimensional structure determination. The initial compound, haloperidol, was discovered through computational screening of the Cambridge Structural Database using a shape complementarity algorithm. The subsequent modification is a non-peptidic lateral lead, which belongs to a family of compounds with well characterized pharmacological properties. This thioketal derivative of haloperidol and a halide counterion are bound within the enzyme active site in a mode distinct from the observed for peptide-based inhibitors. A variant of the protease cocrystallized with this inhibitor shows binding in the manner predicted during the initial computer-based search. The structures provide the context for subsequent synthetic modifications of the inhibitor.</p>

<p>The JmjC oxygenases catalyze the N-demethylation of N(ε)-methyl lysine residues in histones and are current therapeutic targets. A set of human 2-oxoglutarate analogues were screened using a unified assay platform for JmjC demethylases and related oxygenases. Results led to the finding that daminozide (N-(dimethylamino)succinamic acid, 160 Da), a plant growth regulator, selectively inhibits the KDM2/7 JmjC subfamily. Kinetic and crystallographic studies reveal that daminozide chelates the active site metal via its hydrazide carbonyl and dimethylamino groups.</p>

<p>Thiaminases are responsible for the degradation of thiamin and its metabolites. Two classes of thiaminases have been identified based on their three-dimensional structures and their requirements for a nucleophilic second substrate. Although the reactions of several thiaminases have been characterized, the physiological role of thiamin degradation is not fully understood. We have determined the three-dimensional X-ray structure of an inactive C143S mutant of Clostridium botulinum (Cb) thiaminase I with bound thiamin at 2.2 Å resolution. The C143S/thiamin complex provides atomic level details of the orientation of thiamin upon binding to Cb-thiaminase I and the identity of active site residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The specific roles of active site residues were probed by using site directed mutagenesis and kinetic analyses, leading to a detailed mechanism for Cb-thiaminase I. The structure of Cb-thiaminase I is also compared to the functionally similar but structurally distinct thiaminase II.</p>

<p>3(17)alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C21) is a unique member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily owing to its ability to reduce 17-ketosteroids to 17alpha-hydroxysteroids, as opposed to other members of the AKR family, which can only produce 17beta-hydroxysteroids. In this paper, the crystal structure of a double mutant (G225P/G226P) of AKR1C21 in complex with the coenzyme NADP(+) and the inhibitor hexoestrol refined at 2.1 A resolution is presented. Kinetic analysis and molecular-modelling studies of 17alpha- and 17beta-hydroxysteroid substrates in the active site of AKR1C21 suggested that Gly225 and Gly226 play an important role in determining the substrate stereospecificity of the enzyme. Additionally, the G225P/G226P mutation of the enzyme reduced the affinity (K(m)) for both 3alpha- and 17alpha-hydroxysteroid substrates by up to 160-fold, indicating that these residues are critical for the binding of substrates.</p>

<p>Enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt are important for the virulence of pathogenic organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans. Two isoforms have been identified for malate synthase, the second enzyme in the pathway. Isoform A, found in fungi and plants, comprises approximately 530 residues, whereas isoform G, found only in bacteria, is larger by approximately 200 residues. Crystal structures of malate synthase isoform G from Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were previously determined at moderate resolution. Here we describe crystal structures of E. coli malate synthase A (MSA) in the apo form (1.04 A resolution) and in complex with acetyl-coenzyme A and a competitive inhibitor, possibly pyruvate or oxalate (1.40 A resolution). In addition, a crystal structure for Bacillus anthracis MSA at 1.70 A resolution is reported. The increase in size between isoforms A and G can be attributed primarily to an inserted alpha/beta domain that may have regulatory function. Upon binding of inhibitor or substrate, several active site loops in MSA undergo large conformational changes. However, in the substrate bound form, the active sites of isoforms A and G from E. coli are nearly identical. Considering that inhibitors bind with very similar affinities to both isoforms, MSA is as an excellent platform for high-resolution structural studies and drug discovery efforts.</p>

<p>The structure of aldehyde reductase (ALR1) in ternary complex with the coenzyme NADPH and 3,5-dichlorosalicylic acid (DCL), a potent inhibitor of human 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C1), was determined at a resolution of 2.41A. The inhibitor formed a network of hydrogen bonds with the active site residues Trp22, Tyr50, His113, Trp114 and Arg312. Molecular modelling calculations together with inhibitory activity measurements indicated that DCL was a less potent inhibitor of ALR1 (256-fold) when compared to AKR1C1. In AKR1C1, the inhibitor formed a 10-fold stronger binding interaction with the catalytic residue (Tyr55), non-conserved hydrogen bonding interaction with His222, and additional van der Waals contacts with the non-conserved C-terminal residues Leu306, Leu308 and Phe311 that contribute to the inhibitor's selectivity advantage for AKR1C1 over ALR1.</p>

<p>A role for protein dynamics in enzymatic catalysis of hydrogen transfer has received substantial scientific support, but the connections between protein structure and catalysis remain to be established. Valine residues 203 and 207 are at the binding site for the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme in liver alcohol dehydrogenase and have been suggested to facilitate catalysis with "protein-promoting vibrations" (PPV). We find that the V207A substitution has small effects on steady-state kinetic constants and the rate of hydrogen transfer; the introduced cavity is empty and is tolerated with minimal effects on structure (determined at 1.2 Å for the complex with NAD(+) and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl alcohol). Thus, no evidence is found to support a role for Val-207 in the dynamics of catalysis. The protein structures and ligand geometries (including donor-acceptor distances) in the V203A enzyme complexed with NAD(+) and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl alcohol or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (determined at 1.1 Å) are very similar to those for the wild-type enzyme, except that the introduced cavity accommodates a new water molecule that contacts the nicotinamide ring. The structures of the V203A enzyme complexes suggest, in contrast to previous studies, that the diminished tunneling and decreased rate of hydride transfer (16-fold, relative to that of the wild-type enzyme) are not due to differences in ground-state ligand geometries. The V203A substitution may alter the PPV and the reorganization energy for hydrogen transfer, but the protein scaffold and equilibrium thermal motions within the Michaelis complex may be more significant for enzyme catalysis. </p>

<p>We have solved two families of crystal structures of the human Dicer "platform-PAZ-connector helix" cassette in complex with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The structures possess two adjacently positioned pockets: a 2 nt 3'-overhang-binding pocket within the PAZ domain (3' pocket) and a phosphate-binding pocket within the platform domain (phosphate pocket). One family of complexes contains a knob-like α-helical protrusion, designated "hDicer-specific helix," that separates the two pockets and orients the bound siRNA away from the surface of Dicer, which could be indicative of a product release/transfer state. In the second complex, the helical protrusion is melted/disordered and the bound siRNA is aligned toward the surface of Dicer, suggestive of a cleavage-competent state. These structures allow us to propose that the transition from the cleavage-competent to the postulated product release/transfer state may involve release of the 5'-phosphate from the phosphate pocket while retaining the 3' overhang in the 3' pocket. </p>

<p>We have used chemical protein synthesis and advanced physical methods to probe dynamics-function correlations for the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme that has received considerable attention as a target for the treatment of AIDS. Chemical synthesis was used to prepare a series of unique analogues of the HIV-1 protease in which the flexibility of the "flap" structures (residues 37-61 in each monomer of the homodimeric protein molecule) was systematically varied. These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations. We show that conformational isomerization in the flaps is correlated with structural reorganization of residues in the active site, and that it is preorganization of the active site that is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis.</p>

<p>Developing antimicrobials that are less likely to engender resistance has become an important design criterion as more and more drugs fall victim to resistance mutations. One hypothesis is that the more closely an inhibitor resembles a substrate, the more difficult it will be to develop resistant mutations that can at once disfavor the inhibitor and still recognize the substrate. To investigate this hypothesis, 10 transition-state analogues, of greater or lesser similarity to substrates, were tested for inhibition of TEM-1 beta-lactamase, the most widespread resistance enzyme to penicillin antibiotics. The inhibitors were also tested against four characteristic mutant enzymes: TEM-30, TEM-32, TEM-52, and TEM-64. The inhibitor most similar to the substrate, compound 10, was the most potent inhibitor of the WT enzyme, with a K(i) value of 64 nM. Conversely, compound 10 was the most susceptible to the TEM-30 (R244S) mutant, for which inhibition dropped by over 100-fold. The other inhibitors were relatively impervious to the TEM-30 mutant enzyme. To understand recognition and resistance to these transition-state analogues, the structures of four of these inhibitors in complex with TEM-1 were determined by X-ray crystallography. These structures suggest a structural basis for distinguishing inhibitors that mimic the acylation transition state and those that mimic the deacylation transition state; they also suggest how TEM-30 reduces the affinity of compound 10. In cell culture, this inhibitor reversed the resistance of bacteria to ampicillin, reducing minimum inhibitory concentrations of this penicillin by between 4- and 64-fold, depending on the strain of bacteria. Notwithstanding this activity, the resistance of TEM-30, which is already extant in the clinic, suggests that there can be resistance liabilities with substrate-based design.</p>

<p>The crystal structures of six human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) ternary complexes with NADPH and a series of mixed E/Z isomers of 5-substituted 5-[2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-prop-1-en-1-yl]furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamines substituted at the C9 position with propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, butyl, isobutyl and sec-butyl (E2-E7, Z3) were determined and the results were compared with the resolved E and Z isomers of the C9-methyl parent compound. The configuration of all of the inhibitors, save one, was observed as the E isomer, in which the binding of the furopyrimidine ring is flipped such that the 4-amino group binds in the 4-oxo site of folate. The Z3 isomer of the C9-isopropyl analog has the normal 2,4-diaminopyrimidine ring binding geometry, with the furo oxygen near Glu30 and the 4-amino group interacting near the cofactor nicotinamide ring. Electron-density maps for these structures revealed the binding of only one isomer to hDHFR, despite the fact that chiral mixtures (E:Z ratios of 2:1, 3:1 and 3:2) of the inhibitors were incubated with hDHFR prior to crystallization. Superposition of the hDHFR complexes with E2 and Z3 shows that the 2'-methoxyphenyl ring of E2 is perpendicular to that of Z3. The most potent inhibitor in this series is the isopropyl analog Z3 and the least potent is the isobutyl analog E6, consistent with data that show that the Z isomer makes the most favorable interactions with the active-site residues. The isobutyl moiety of E6 is observed in two orientations and the resultant steric crowding of the E6 analog is consistent with its weaker activity. The alternative binding modes observed for the furopyrimidine ring in these E/Z isomers suggest that new templates can be designed to probe these binding regions of the DHFR active site.</p>

<p>We have used chemical protein synthesis and advanced physical methods to probe dynamics-function correlations for the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme that has received considerable attention as a target for the treatment of AIDS. Chemical synthesis was used to prepare a series of unique analogues of the HIV-1 protease in which the flexibility of the "flap" structures (residues 37-61 in each monomer of the homodimeric protein molecule) was systematically varied. These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations. We show that conformational isomerization in the flaps is correlated with structural reorganization of residues in the active site, and that it is preorganization of the active site that is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis.</p>

<p>The shikimate pathway is essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its absence from humans makes the enzymes of this pathway potential drug targets. In the present paper, we provide structural insights into ligand and inhibitor binding to 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (dehydroquinase) from M. tuberculosis (MtDHQase), the third enzyme of the shikimate pathway. The enzyme has been crystallized in complex with its reaction product, 3-dehydroshikimate, and with six different competitive inhibitors. The inhibitor 2,3-anhydroquinate mimics the flattened enol/enolate reaction intermediate and serves as an anchor molecule for four of the inhibitors investigated. MtDHQase also forms a complex with citrazinic acid, a planar analogue of the reaction product. The structure of MtDHQase in complex with a 2,3-anhydroquinate moiety attached to a biaryl group shows that this group extends to an active-site subpocket inducing significant structural rearrangement. The flexible extensions of inhibitors designed to form π-stacking interactions with the catalytic Tyr24 have been investigated. The high-resolution crystal structures of the MtDHQase complexes provide structural evidence for the role of the loop residues 19-24 in MtDHQase ligand binding and catalytic mechanism and provide a rationale for the design and efficacy of inhibitors.</p>

<p>Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs)-1 and -2 (also called cyclooxygenases (COXs)-1 and -2) catalyze the committed step in prostaglandin biosynthesis. Both isoforms are targets of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). PGHSs are homodimers that exhibit half-of-sites COX activity; moreover, some NSAIDs cause enzyme inhibition by binding only one monomer. To learn more about the cross-talk that must be occurring between the monomers comprising each PGHS-1 dimer, we analyzed structures of PGHS-1 crystallized under five different conditions including in the absence of any tightly binding ligand and in the presence of nonspecific NSAIDs and of a COX-2 inhibitor. When crystallized with substoichiometric amounts of an NSAID, both monomers are often fully occupied with inhibitor; thus, the enzyme prefers to crystallize in a fully occupied form. In comparing the five structures, we only observe changes in the positions of residues 123-129 and residues 510-515. In cases where one monomer is fully occupied with an NSAID and the partner monomer is incompletely occupied, an alternate conformation of the loop involving residues 123-129 is seen in the partially occupied monomer. We propose, on the basis of this observation and previous cross-linking studies, that cross-talk between monomers involves this mobile 123-129 loop, which is located at the dimer interface. In ovine PGHS-1 crystallized in the absence of an NSAID, there is an alternative route for substrate entry into the COX site different than the well-known route through the membrane binding domain.</p>

<p>Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), a complex molybdo/iron-sulfur/flavoprotein, catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine followed by oxidation of xanthine to uric acid with concomitant reduction of NAD+. The 2.7 A resolution structure of Rhodobacter capsulatus XDH reveals that the bacterial and bovine XDH have highly similar folds despite differences in subunit composition. The NAD+ binding pocket of the bacterial XDH resembles that of the dehydrogenase form of the bovine enzyme rather than that of the oxidase form, which reduces O(2) instead of NAD+. The drug allopurinol is used to treat XDH-catalyzed uric acid build-up occurring in gout or during cancer chemotherapy. As a hypoxanthine analog, it is oxidized to alloxanthine, which cannot be further oxidized but acts as a tight binding inhibitor of XDH. The 3.0 A resolution structure of the XDH-alloxanthine complex shows direct coordination of alloxanthine to the molybdenum via a nitrogen atom. These results provide a starting point for the rational design of new XDH inhibitors.</p>

<p>The three-dimensional structure of a complex between the pectate lyase C (PelC) R218K mutant and a plant cell wall fragment has been determined by x-ray diffraction techniques to a resolution of 2.2 A and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 18.6%. The oligosaccharide substrate, alpha-D-GalpA-([1--&gt;4]-alpha-D-GalpA)3-(1--&gt;4)-D-GalpA , is composed of five galacturonopyranose units (D-GalpA) linked by alpha-(1--&gt;4) glycosidic bonds. PelC is secreted by the plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi and degrades the pectate component of plant cell walls in soft rot diseases. The substrate has been trapped in crystals by using the inactive R218K mutant. Four of the five saccharide units of the substrate are well ordered and represent an atomic view of the pectate component in plant cell walls. The conformation of the pectate fragment is a mix of 21 and 31 right-handed helices. The substrate binds in a cleft, interacting primarily with positively charged groups: either lysine or arginine amino acids on PelC or the four Ca2+ ions found in the complex. The observed protein-oligosaccharide interactions provide a functional explanation for many of the invariant and conserved amino acids in the pectate lyase family of proteins. Because the R218K PelC-galacturonopentaose complex represents an intermediate in the reaction pathway, the structure also reveals important details regarding the enzymatic mechanism. Notably, the results suggest that an arginine, which is invariant in the pectate lyase superfamily, is the amino acid that initiates proton abstraction during the beta elimination cleavage of polygalacturonic acid.</p>

<p>Metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) require Zn(2+) or Fe(2+) to regulate the acetylation of lysine residues in histones and other proteins in eukaryotic cells. Isozyme HDAC8 is perhaps the archetypical member of the class I HDAC family and serves as a paradigm for studying structure-function relationships. Here, we report the structures of HDAC8 complexes with trichostatin A and 3-(1-methyl-4-phenylacetyl-1H-2-pyrrolyl)-N-hydroxy-2-propenamide (APHA) in a new crystal form. The structure of the APHA complex reveals that the hydroxamate CO group accepts a hydrogen bond from Y306 but does not coordinate to Zn(2+) with favorable geometry, perhaps due to the constraints of its extended pi system. Additionally, since APHA binds to only two of the three protein molecules in the asymmetric unit of this complex, the structure of the third monomer represents the first structure of HDAC8 in the unliganded state. Comparison of unliganded and liganded structures illustrates ligand-induced conformational changes in the L2 loop that likely accompany substrate binding and catalysis. Furthermore, these structures, along with those of the D101N, D101E, D101A, and D101L variants, support the proposal that D101 is critical for the function of the L2 loop. However, amino acid substitutions for D101 can also trigger conformational changes of Y111 and W141 that perturb the substrate binding site. Finally, the structure of H143A HDAC8 complexed with an intact acetylated tetrapeptide substrate molecule confirms the importance of D101 for substrate binding and reveals how Y306 and the active site zinc ion together bind and activate the scissile amide linkage of acetyllysine.</p>

<p>Orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPD) catalyzes the decarboxylation of orotidine-5'-monophosphate (OMP) to uridine-5'-monophosphate (UMP) in an extremely proficient manner. The reaction does not require any cofactors and proceeds by an unknown mechanism. In addition to decarboxylation, OMPD is able to catalyze other reactions. We show that several C6-substituted UMP derivatives undergo hydrolysis or substitution reactions that depend on a lysine residue (Lys314) in the OMPD active site. 6-Cyano-UMP is converted to UMP, and UMP derivatives with good leaving groups inhibit OMPD by a suicide mechanism in which Lys314 covalently binds to the substrate. These non-classical reactivities of human OMPD were characterized by cocrystallization and freeze-trapping experiments with wild-type OMPD and two active-site mutants by using substrate and inhibitor nucleotides. The structures show that the C6-substituents are not coplanar with the pyrimidine ring. The extent of this substrate distortion is a function of the substituent geometry. Structure-based mechanisms for the reaction of 6-substituted UMP derivatives are extracted in accordance with results from mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, and OMPD enzyme activity. The Lys314-based mechanisms explain the chemodiversity of OMPD, and offer a strategy to design mechanism-based inhibitors that could be used for antineoplastic purposes for example.</p>

<p>We have determined the crystal structure of a complex between the noncompetitive inhibitor (Kis = 27 microM, Kii = 48 microM with respect to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and Kis = 144 microM, Kii = 176 microM with respect to NADPH) 6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthene-9-propionic acid (XAN) and human glutathione reductase (hGR). The structure, refined to an R-factor of 0.158 at 2.0 A resolution, reveals XAN bound in the large cavity present at the hGR dimer interface where it does not overlap the glutathione binding site. The inhibitor binding causes extensive local structural changes that primarily involve amino acid residues from a 30-residue alpha-helix that lines the cavity and contributes to the active site of hGR. Despite the lack of physical overlap of XAN with the GSSG binding site, no GSSG binding is seen in soaks carried out with high XAN and GSSG concentrations, suggesting that some subtle interaction between the sites exists. An earlier crystallographic analysis on the complex between hGR and 3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenyl-phenazinium chloride (safranin) showed that safranin bound at this same site. We have found that safranin also inhibits hGR in a noncompetitive fashion, but it binds about 16 times less tightly (Kis = 453 microM, Kii = 586 microM with respect to GSSG) than XAN and does not preclude the binding of GSSG in the crystal. Although in structure-based drug design competitive inhibitors are usually targetted, XAN's binding to a well defined site that is unique to glutathione reductase suggests that noncompetitive inhibitors could also serve as lead compounds for structure-based drug design, in particular as components of chimeric inhibitors.</p>

<p>The COP9 (Constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome (CSN), a large multiprotein complex that resembles the 19S lid of the 26S proteasome, plays a central role in the regulation of the E3-cullin RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). The catalytic activity of the CSN complex, carried by subunit 5 (CSN5/Jab1), resides in the deneddylation of the CRLs that is the hydrolysis of the cullin-neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated gene 8 (Nedd8)isopeptide bond. Whereas CSN-dependent CSN5 displays isopeptidase activity, it is intrinsically inactive in other physiologically relevant forms. Here we analyze the crystal structure of CSN5 in its catalytically inactive form to illuminate the molecular basis for its activation state. We show that CSN5 presents a catalytic domain that brings essential elements to understand its activity control. Although the CSN5 active site is catalytically competent and compatible with di-isopeptide binding, the Ins-1 segment obstructs access to its substrate-binding site, and structural rearrangements are necessary for the Nedd8-binding pocket formation. Detailed study of CSN5 by molecular dynamics unveils signs of flexibility and plasticity of the Ins-1 segment. These analyses led to the identification of a molecular trigger implicated in the active/inactive switch that is sufficient to impose on CSN5 an active isopeptidase state. We show that a single mutation in the Ins-1 segment restores biologically relevant deneddylase activity. This study presents detailed insights into CSN5 regulation. Additionally, a dynamic monomer-dimer equilibrium exists both in vitro and in vivo and may be functionally relevant.</p>

<p>The binding of (+)-camphor to cytochrome P450cam (P450cam) expels a cluster of waters at the active site, raising the redox potential of the haem to an extent that allows reduction by the electron-transfer system. This binding was reported to involve no significant structural changes in the protein. Here, two ferric P450cam structures partially complexed with (+)-camphor were determined by X-ray crystallography at 1.30-1.35 A resolution, revealing the structures of the substrate-free and substrate-bound forms. (+)-Camphor binding induces rotation of Thr101 to form a hydrogen bond that acts as a hydrogen donor to a peripheral haem propionate. This bonding contributes to the redox-potential change.</p>

<p>The de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is an emerging drug target for the treatment of malaria. In this context a key property of Plasmodium falciparum DHODH (PfDHODH) is that it can be selectively inhibited over its human homologue (HsDHODH). However, HsDHODH is also a validated drug target for autoimmune diseases such as arthritis. Here a series of novel inhibitors is described that includes compounds that switch specificity between the two enzymes as a result of small alterations in chemical structure. Structure-activity relationship (SAR), crystallography, docking, and mutagenesis studies are used to examine the binding modes of the compounds within the two enzymes and to reveal structural changes induced by inhibitor binding. Within this series, compounds with therapeutically relevant HsDHODH activity are described and their binding modes characterized using X-ray crystallography, which reveals a novel conformational shift within the inhibitor binding site.</p>

<p>Ceramidase (CDase; EC 3.5.1.23) hydrolyzes ceramide to generate sphingosine and fatty acid. The enzyme plays a regulatory role in a variety of physiological events in eukaryotes and also functions as an exotoxin in particular bacteria. The crystal structures of neutral CDase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaCD) in the C2-ceramide-bound and -unbound forms were determined at 2.2 and 1.4 A resolutions, respectively. PaCD consists of two domains, and the Zn(2+)- and Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-binding sites are found within the center of the N-terminal domain and the interface between the domains, respectively. The structural comparison between the C2-ceramide-bound and unbound forms revealed an open-closed conformational change occurring to loop I upon binding of C2-ceramide. In the closed state, this loop sits above the Zn(2+) coordination site and over the opening to the substrate binding site. Mutational analyses of residues surrounding the Zn(2+) of PaCD and rat neutral CDase revealed that the cleavage or creation of the N-acyl linkage of ceramide follows a similar mechanism as observed for the Zn(2+)-dependent carboxypeptidases. The results provide an understanding of the molecular mechanism of hydrolysis and synthesis of ceramide by the enzyme. Furthermore, insights into the actions of PaCD and eukaryotic neutral CDases as an exotoxin and mediators of sphingolipid signaling are also revealed, respectively.</p>

<p>Biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor, isopentenyl diphosphate, is a critical function in all independently living organisms. There are two major pathways for this synthesis, the non-mevalonate pathway found in most eubacteria and the mevalonate pathway found in animal cells and a number of pathogenic bacteria. An early step in this pathway is the condensation of acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase. To explore the possibility of a small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme functioning as a non-cell wall antibiotic, the structure of HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus faecalis (MVAS) was determined by selenomethionine MAD phasing to 2.4 A and the enzyme complexed with its second substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA, to 1.9 A. These structures show that HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus is a member of the family of thiolase fold enzymes and, while similar to the recently published HMG-CoA synthase structures from Staphylococcus aureus, exhibit significant differences in the structure of the C-terminal domain. The acetoacetyl-CoA binary structure demonstrates reduced coenzyme A and acetoacetate covalently bound to the active site cysteine through a thioester bond. This is consistent with the kinetics of the reaction that have shown acetoacetyl-CoA to be a potent inhibitor of the overall reaction, and provides a starting point in the search for a small molecule inhibitor.</p>

<p>Prediction of interaction energies between ligands and their receptors remains a major challenge for structure-based inhibitor discovery. Much effort has been devoted to developing scoring schemes that can successfully rank the affinities of a diverse set of possible ligands to a binding site for which the structure is known. To test these scoring functions, well-characterized experimental systems can be very useful. Here, mutation-created binding sites in T4 lysozyme were used to investigate how the quality of atomic charges and solvation energies affects molecular docking. Atomic charges and solvation energies were calculated for 172,118 molecules in the Available Chemicals Directory using a semi-empirical quantum mechanical approach by the program AMSOL. The database was first screened against the apolar cavity site created by the mutation Leu99Ala (L99A). Compared to the electronegativity-based charges that are widely used, the new charges and desolvation energies improved ranking of known apolar ligands, and better distinguished them from more polar isosteres that are not observed to bind. To investigate whether the new charges had predictive value, the non-polar residue Met102, which forms part of the binding site, was changed to the polar residue glutamine. The structure of the resulting Leu99Ala and Met102Gln double mutant of T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q) was determined and the docking calculation was repeated for the new site. Seven representative polar molecules that preferentially docked to the polar versus the apolar binding site were tested experimentally. All seven bind to the polar cavity (L99A/M102Q) but do not detectably bind to the apolar cavity (L99A). Five ligand-bound structures of L99A/M102Q were determined by X-ray crystallography. Docking predictions corresponded to the crystallographic results to within 0.4A RMSD. Improved treatment of partial atomic charges and desolvation energies in database docking appears feasible and leads to better distinction of true ligands. Simple model binding sites, such as L99A and its more polar variants, may find broad use in the development and testing of docking algorithms.</p>

<p>DNA synthesis during replication relies on RNA primers synthesised by the primase, a specialised DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that can initiate nucleic acid synthesis de novo. In archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, the primase is a heterodimeric enzyme resulting from the constitutive association of a small (PriS) and large (PriL) subunit. The ability of the primase to initiate synthesis of an RNA primer depends on a conserved Fe-S domain at the C-terminus of PriL (PriL-CTD). However, the critical role of the PriL-CTD in the catalytic mechanism of initiation is not understood.</p>

<p>Tris-dipicolinate lanthanide complexes were used to prepare derivative crystals of six proteins: hen egg-white lysozyme, turkey egg-white lysozyme, thaumatin from Thaumatococcus daniellii, urate oxidase from Aspergillus flavus, porcine pancreatic elastase and xylanase from Trichoderma reesei. Diffraction data were collected using either synchrotron radiation or X-rays from a laboratory source. In all cases, the complex turned out to be bound to the protein and the phases determined using the anomalous scattering of the lanthanide led to high-quality electron-density maps. The binding mode of the complex was characterized from the refined structures. The lanthanide tris-dipicolinate was found to bind through interactions between carboxylate groups of the dipicolinate ligands and hydrogen-bond donor groups of the protein. In each binding site, one enantiomeric form of the complex is selected from the racemic solution according to the specific site topology. For hen egg-white lysozyme and xylanase, derivative crystals obtained by cocrystallization belonged to a new monoclinic C2 crystal form that diffracted to high resolution.</p>

<p>Drug resistance resulting from mutations to the target is an unfortunate common phenomenon that limits the lifetime of many of the most successful drugs. In contrast to the investigation of mutations after clinical exposure, it would be powerful to be able to incorporate strategies early in the development process to predict and overcome the effects of possible resistance mutations. Here we present a unique prospective application of an ensemble-based protein design algorithm, K*, to predict potential resistance mutations in dihydrofolate reductase from Staphylococcus aureus using positive design to maintain catalytic function and negative design to interfere with binding of a lead inhibitor. Enzyme inhibition assays show that three of the four highly-ranked predicted mutants are active yet display lower affinity (18-, 9-, and 13-fold) for the inhibitor. A crystal structure of the top-ranked mutant enzyme validates the predicted conformations of the mutated residues and the structural basis of the loss of potency. The use of protein design algorithms to predict resistance mutations could be incorporated in a lead design strategy against any target that is susceptible to mutational resistance.</p>

<p>RluB catalyses the modification of U2605 to pseudouridine (Ψ) in a stem-loop at the peptidyl transferase center of Escherichia coli 23S rRNA. The homolog RluF is specific to the adjacent nucleotide in the stem, U2604. The 1.3 Å resolution crystal structure of the complex between the catalytic domain of RluB and the isolated substrate stem-loop, in which the target uridine is substituted by 5-fluorouridine (5-FU), reveals a covalent bond between the isomerized target base and tyrosine 140. The structure is compared with the catalytic domain alone determined at 2.5 Å resolution. The RluB-bound stem-loop has essentially the same secondary structure as in the ribosome, with a bulge at A2602, but with 5-FU2605 flipped into the active site. We showed earlier that RluF induced a frame-shift of the RNA, moving A2602 into the stem and translating its target, U2604, into the active site. A hydrogen-bonding network stabilizes the bulge in the RluB-RNA but is not conserved in RluF and so RluF cannot stabilize the bulge. On the basis of the covalent bond between enzyme and isomerized 5-FU we propose a Michael addition mechanism for pseudouridine formation that is consistent with all experimental data. </p>

<p>Malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (FabD; EC 2.3.1.39) is a key enzyme in the fatty-acid biosynthesis pathway of bacteria, catalyzing the transfer of a malonyl moiety from malonyl-CoA to holo acyl carrier protein (ACP), generating malonyl-ACP and free CoASH. Malonyl-ACP, which is the product of this reaction, is the key building block for de novo fatty-acid biosynthesis. Various binary complex structures of the Escherichia coli enzyme are presented, including that of the natural substrate malonyl-CoA, indicating the functional role of the highly conserved amino acids Gln11, Ser92, Arg117 and His201 and the stabilizing function of the preformed oxyanion hole during the enzymatic reaction. Based on the presented structural data, a possible new catalytic enzyme mechanism is discussed. The data obtained could be used in aiding the process of rational inhibitor design.</p>

<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) catalyzes the maturation of the 5' end of tRNA precursors. Typically these enzymes are ribonucleoproteins with a conserved RNA component responsible for catalysis. However, protein-only RNase P (PRORP) enzymes process precursor tRNAs in human mitochondria and in all tRNA-using compartments of Arabidopsis thaliana. PRORP enzymes are nuclear encoded and conserved among many eukaryotes, having evolved recently as yeast mitochondrial genomes encode an RNase P RNA. Here we report the crystal structure of PRORP1 from A. thaliana at 1.75 Å resolution, revealing a prototypical metallonuclease domain tethered to a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain by a structural zinc-binding domain. The metallonuclease domain is a unique high-resolution structure of a Nedd4-BP1, YacP Nucleases (NYN) domain that is a member of the PIN domain-like fold superfamily, including the FLAP nuclease family. The structural similarity between PRORP1 and the FLAP nuclease family suggests that they evolved from a common ancestor. Biochemical data reveal that conserved aspartate residues in PRORP1 are important for catalytic activity and metal binding and that the PPR domain also enhances activity, likely through an interaction with pre-tRNA. These results provide a foundation for understanding tRNA maturation in organelles. Furthermore, these studies allow for a molecular-level comparison of the catalytic strategies used by the only known naturally evolved protein and RNA-based catalysts that perform the same biological function, pre-tRNA maturation, thereby providing insight into the differences between the prebiotic RNA world and the present protein-dominated world.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of toluene 4-monooxygenase hydroxylase in complex with reaction products and effector protein reveal active site interactions leading to regiospecificity. Complexes with phenolic products yield an asymmetric μ-phenoxo-bridged diiron center and a shift of diiron ligand E231 into a hydrogen bonding position with conserved T201. In contrast, complexes with inhibitors p-NH(2)-benzoate and p-Br-benzoate showed a μ-1,1 coordination of carboxylate oxygen between the iron atoms and only a partial shift in the position of E231. Among active site residues, F176 trapped the aromatic ring of products against a surface of the active site cavity formed by G103, E104 and A107, while F196 positioned the aromatic ring against this surface via a π-stacking interaction. The proximity of G103 and F176 to the para substituent of the substrate aromatic ring and the structure of G103L T4moHD suggest how changes in regiospecificity arise from mutations at G103. Although effector protein binding produced significant shifts in the positions of residues along the outer portion of the active site (T201, N202, and Q228) and in some iron ligands (E231 and E197), surprisingly minor shifts (&lt;1 Å) were produced in F176, F196, and other interior residues of the active site. Likewise, products bound to the diiron center in either the presence or absence of effector protein did not significantly shift the position of the interior residues, suggesting that positioning of the cognate substrates will not be strongly influenced by effector protein binding. Thus, changes in product distributions in the absence of the effector protein are proposed to arise from differences in rates of chemical steps of the reaction relative to motion of substrates within the active site channel of the uncomplexed, less efficient enzyme, while structural changes in diiron ligand geometry associated with cycling between diferrous and diferric states are discussed for their potential contribution to product release.</p>

<p>The alkaline phosphatase (AP) is a bi-metalloenzyme of potential applications in biotechnology and bioremediation, in which phosphate monoesters are nonspecifically hydrolysed under alkaline conditions to yield inorganic phosphate. The hydrolysis occurs through an enzyme intermediate in which the catalytic residue is phosphorylated. The reaction, which also requires a third metal ion, is proposed to proceed through a mechanism of in-line displacement involving a trigonal bipyramidal transition state. Stabilizing the transition state by bidentate hydrogen bonding has been suggested to be the reason for conservation of an arginine residue in the active site. We report here the first crystal structure of alkaline phosphatase purified from the bacterium Sphingomonas. sp. Strain BSAR-1 (SPAP). The crystal structure reveals many differences from other APs: 1) the catalytic residue is a threonine instead of serine, 2) there is no third metal ion binding pocket, and 3) the arginine residue forming bidentate hydrogen bonding is deleted in SPAP. A lysine and an aspargine residue, recruited together for the first time into the active site, bind the substrate phosphoryl group in a manner not observed before in any other AP. These and other structural features suggest that SPAP represents a new class of APs. Because of its direct contact with the substrate phosphoryl group, the lysine residue is proposed to play a significant role in catalysis. The structure is consistent with a mechanism of in-line displacement via a trigonal bipyramidal transition state. The structure provides important insights into evolutionary relationships between members of AP superfamily.</p>

<p>X-ray crystallography typically uses a single set of coordinates and B factors to describe macromolecular conformations. Refinement of multiple copies of the entire structure has been previously used in specific cases as an alternative means of representing structural flexibility. Here, we systematically validate this method by using simulated diffraction data, and we find that ensemble refinement produces better representations of the distributions of atomic positions in the simulated structures than single-conformer refinements. Comparison of principal components calculated from the refined ensembles and simulations shows that concerted motions are captured locally, but that correlations dissipate over long distances. Ensemble refinement is also used on 50 experimental structures of varying resolution and leads to decreases in R(free) values, implying that improvements in the representation of flexibility observed for the simulated structures may apply to real structures. These gains are essentially independent of resolution or data-to-parameter ratio, suggesting that even structures at moderate resolution can benefit from ensemble refinement.</p>

<p>Crystal structures of toluene 4-monooxygenase hydroxylase in complex with reaction products and effector protein reveal active site interactions leading to regiospecificity. Complexes with phenolic products yield an asymmetric μ-phenoxo-bridged diiron center and a shift of diiron ligand E231 into a hydrogen bonding position with conserved T201. In contrast, complexes with inhibitors p-NH(2)-benzoate and p-Br-benzoate showed a μ-1,1 coordination of carboxylate oxygen between the iron atoms and only a partial shift in the position of E231. Among active site residues, F176 trapped the aromatic ring of products against a surface of the active site cavity formed by G103, E104 and A107, while F196 positioned the aromatic ring against this surface via a π-stacking interaction. The proximity of G103 and F176 to the para substituent of the substrate aromatic ring and the structure of G103L T4moHD suggest how changes in regiospecificity arise from mutations at G103. Although effector protein binding produced significant shifts in the positions of residues along the outer portion of the active site (T201, N202, and Q228) and in some iron ligands (E231 and E197), surprisingly minor shifts (&lt;1 Å) were produced in F176, F196, and other interior residues of the active site. Likewise, products bound to the diiron center in either the presence or absence of effector protein did not significantly shift the position of the interior residues, suggesting that positioning of the cognate substrates will not be strongly influenced by effector protein binding. Thus, changes in product distributions in the absence of the effector protein are proposed to arise from differences in rates of chemical steps of the reaction relative to motion of substrates within the active site channel of the uncomplexed, less efficient enzyme, while structural changes in diiron ligand geometry associated with cycling between diferrous and diferric states are discussed for their potential contribution to product release.</p>

<p>Escherichia coli endonuclease VIII (Nei) excises oxidized pyrimidines from DNA. It shares significant sequence homology and similar mechanism with Fpg, a bacterial 8-oxoguanine glycosylase. The structure of a covalent Nei-DNA complex has been recently determined, revealing critical amino acid residues which are important for DNA binding and catalysis. Several Fpg structures have also been reported; however, analysis of structural dynamics of Fpg/Nei family proteins has been hindered by the lack of structures of uncomplexed and DNA-bound enzymes from the same source. We report a 2.8 A resolution structure of free wild-type Nei and two structures of its inactive mutants, Nei-E2A (2.3 A) and Nei-R252A (2.05 A). All three structures are virtually identical, demonstrating that the mutations did not affect the overall conformation of the protein in its free state. The structures show a significant conformational change compared with the Nei structure in its complex with DNA, reflecting a approximately 50 degrees rotation of the two main domains of the enzyme. Such interdomain flexibility has not been reported previously for any DNA glycosylase and may present the first evidence for a global DNA-induced conformational change in this class of enzymes. Several local but functionally relevant structural changes are also evident in other parts of the enzyme.</p>

<p>The quinoprotein aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH) uses a covalently bound tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor to oxidatively deaminate primary aromatic amines. Recent crystal structures have provided insight into the reductive half-reaction. In contrast, no atomic details are available for the oxidative half-reaction. The TTQ O7 hydroxyl group is protonated during reduction, but it is unclear how this proton can be removed during the oxidative half-reaction. Furthermore, compared with the electron transfer from the N-quinol form, electron transfer from the non-physiological O-quinol form to azurin is significantly slower. Here we report crystal structures of the O-quinol, N-quinol, and N-semiquinone forms of AADH. A comparison of oxidized and substrate reduced AADH species reveals changes in the TTQ-containing subunit, extending from residues in the immediate vicinity of the N-quinol to the putative azurin docking site, suggesting a mechanism whereby TTQ redox state influences interprotein electron transfer. In contrast, chemical reduction of the TTQ center has no significant effect on protein conformation. Furthermore, structural reorganization upon substrate reduction places a water molecule near TTQ O7 where it can act as proton acceptor. The structure of the N-semiquinone, however, is essentially similar to oxidized AADH. Surprisingly, in the presence of substrate a covalent N-semiquinone substrate adduct is observed. To our knowledge this is the first detailed insight into a complex, branching mechanism of quinone oxidation where significant structural reorganization upon reduction of the quinone center directly influences formation of the electron transfer complex and nature of the electron transfer process.</p>

<p>Mistranslation arising from confusion of serine for alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetases (AlaRSs) has profound functional consequences. Throughout evolution, two editing checkpoints prevent disease-causing mistranslation from confusing glycine or serine for alanine at the active site of AlaRS. In both bacteria and mice, Ser poses a bigger challenge than Gly. One checkpoint is the AlaRS editing centre, and the other is from widely distributed AlaXps-free-standing, genome-encoded editing proteins that clear Ser-tRNA(Ala). The paradox of misincorporating both a smaller (glycine) and a larger (serine) amino acid suggests a deep conflict for nature-designed AlaRS. Here we show the chemical basis for this conflict. Nine crystal structures, together with kinetic and mutational analysis, provided snapshots of adenylate formation for each amino acid. An inherent dilemma is posed by constraints of a structural design that pins down the alpha-amino group of the bound amino acid by using an acidic residue. This design, dating back more than 3 billion years, creates a serendipitous interaction with the serine OH that is difficult to avoid. Apparently because no better architecture for the recognition of alanine could be found, the serine misactivation problem was solved through free-standing AlaXps, which appeared contemporaneously with early AlaRSs. The results reveal unconventional problems and solutions arising from the historical design of the protein synthesis machinery.</p>

<p>The Escherichia coli T4 bacteriophage uses two glycosyltransferases to glucosylate and thus protect its DNA: the retaining alpha-glucosyltransferase (AGT) and the inverting beta-glucosyltransferase (BGT). They glucosylate 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-HMC) bases of duplex DNA using UDP-glucose as the sugar donor to form an alpha-glucosidic linkage and a beta-glucosidic linkage, respectively. Five structures of AGT have been determined: a binary complex with the UDP product and four ternary complexes with UDP or UDP-glucose and oligonucleotides containing an A:G, HMU:G (hydroxymethyl uracyl) or AP:G (apurinic/apyrimidinic) mismatch at the target base-pair. AGT adopts the GT-B fold, one of the two folds known for GTs. However, while the sugar donor binding mode is classical for a GT-B enzyme, the sugar acceptor binding mode is unexpected and breaks the established consensus: AGT is the first GT-B enzyme that predominantly binds both the sugar donor and acceptor to the C-terminal domain. Its active site pocket is highly similar to four retaining GT-B glycosyltransferases (trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, glycogen synthase, glycogen and maltodextrin phosphorylases) strongly suggesting a common evolutionary origin and catalytic mechanism for these enzymes. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analysis do not permit identification of a nucleophile residue responsible for a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate for the classical double displacement mechanism. Interestingly, the DNA structures reveal partially flipped-out bases. They provide evidence for a passive role of AGT in the base-flipping mechanism and for its specific recognition of the acceptor base.</p>

<p>Auranofin is a gold(I)-containing drug in clinical use as an antiarthritic agent. Recent studies showed that auranofin manifests interesting antiparasitic actions very likely arising from inhibition of parasitic enzymes involved in the control of the redox metabolism. Trypanothione reductase is a key enzyme of Leishmania infantum polyamine-dependent redox metabolism, and a validated target for antileishmanial drugs. As trypanothione reductase contains a dithiol motif at its active site and gold(I) compounds are known to be highly thiophilic, we explored whether auranofin might behave as an effective enzyme inhibitor and as a potential antileishmanial agent. Notably, enzymatic assays revealed that auranofin causes indeed a pronounced enzyme inhibition. To gain a deeper insight into the molecular basis of enzyme inhibition, crystals of the auranofin-bound enzyme, in the presence of NADPH, were prepared, and the X-ray crystal structure of the auranofin-trypanothione reductase-NADPH complex was solved at 3.5 Å resolution. In spite of the rather low resolution, these data were of sufficient quality as to identify the presence of the gold center and of the thiosugar of auranofin, and to locate them within the overall protein structure. Gold binds to the two active site cysteine residues of TR, i.e. Cys52 and Cys57, while the thiosugar moiety of auranofin binds to the trypanothione binding site; thus auranofin appears to inhibit TR through a dual mechanism. Auranofin kills the promastigote stage of L. infantum at micromolar concentration; these findings will contribute to the design of new drugs against leishmaniasis.</p>

<p>The structure of a mutant variant of Escherichia coli N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid lyase (NAL), E192N, in complex with pyruvate has been determined in a new crystal form. It crystallized in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 78.3, b = 108.5, c = 148.3 angstrom. Pyruvate has been trapped in the active site as a Schiff base with the catalytic lysine (Lys165) without the need for reduction. Unlike the previously published crystallization conditions for the wild-type enzyme, in which a mother-liquor-derived sulfate ion is strongly bound in the catalytic pocket, the low-salt conditions described here will facilitate the determination of further E. coli NAL structures in complex with other activesite ligands.</p>

<p>The activity of class D β-lactamases is dependent on Lys70 carboxylation in the active site. Structural, kinetic and affinity studies show that this post-translational modification can be affected by the presence of a poor substrate such as moxalactam but also by the V117T substitution. Val117 is a strictly conserved hydrophobic residue located in the active site. In addition, inhibition of class D β-lactamases by chloride ions is due to a competition between the side chain carboxylate of the modified Lys70 and chloride ions. Determination of the individual kinetic constants shows that the deacylation of the acyl-enzyme is the rate-limiting step for the wild-type OXA-10 β-lactamase.</p>

<p>A series of hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives have shown inhibitory activity against carbonic anhydrase (CA). X-ray crystallography shows that these molecules inhibit not by binding the active site metal ion but by strong hydrogen bonding to the metal-bound water nucleophile. The binding mode observed for these molecules is distinct when compared to other non-metal-binding CA inhibitors.</p>

<p>beta-lactamases confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins. However, beta-lactams that form an acyl-intermediate with the enzyme but subsequently are hindered from forming a catalytically competent conformation seem to be inhibitors of beta-lactamases. This inhibition may be imparted by specific groups on the ubiquitous R(1) side chain of beta-lactams, such as the 2-amino-4-thiazolyl methoxyimino (ATMO) group common among third-generation cephalosporins. Using steric hindrance of deacylation as a design guide, penicillin and carbacephem substrates were converted into effective beta-lactamase inhibitors and antiresistance antibiotics. To investigate the structural bases of inhibition, the crystal structures of the acyl-adducts of the penicillin substrate amoxicillin and the new analogous inhibitor ATMO-penicillin were determined. ATMO-penicillin binds in a catalytically incompetent conformation resembling that adopted by third-generation cephalosporins, demonstrating the transferability of such sterically hindered groups in inhibitor design.</p>

<p>Fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) is a technique in which small, low-complexity chemical fragments of 6 to 15 heavy atoms are screened for binding to or inhibiting activity of the target. Hits are then linked and/or elaborated into tightly binding ligands, ideally yielding early lead compounds for drug discovery. Calorimetry provides a label-free method to assay binding and enzymatic activity that is unaffected by the spectroscopic properties of the sample. Conventional microcalorimetry is hampered by requiring large quantities of reagents and long measurement times. Nanocalorimeters can overcome these limitations of conventional isothermal titration calorimetry. Here we use enthalpy arrays, which are arrays of nanocalorimeters, to perform an enzyme activity-based fragment screen for competitive inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A). Two dozen fragments with KI &lt;2 mM were identified and moved to crystal soaking trials. All soak experiments yielded high-resolution diffraction, with two-thirds of the fragments yielding high-resolution co-crystal structures with PDE10A. The structural information was used to elaborate fragment hits, yielding leads with KI &lt;1 µM. This study shows how array calorimetry can be used as a prescreening method for fragment-based lead discovery with enzyme targets and paired successfully with an X-ray crystallography secondary screen. </p>

<p>Gossypol is a di-sesquiterpene natural-product in the form of a functionalised binaphthyl and is isolated from cotton plants. The compound has long been known to exhibit anti-malarial and other biological activities. Previous studies have indicated that compounds of this type target Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (pfLDH), an essential enzyme for energy generation within the parasite. In this study, we report that simple naphthalene-based compounds, the core of the gossypol structure, exhibit weak inhibition of the parasite lactate dehydrogenase. Crystal structures of the complexes formed by binding of these naphthalene-based compounds to their target enzyme have been used to delineate the molecular features likely to form the gossypol binding site. Two modes of binding are observed: one overlapping the pyruvate but not the co-factor site, the other bridging the binding sites for the co-factor nicontinamide group and pyruvate substrate. This latter site encompasses molecular features unique to Plasmodium forms of LDH and is likely to represent the mode of binding for gossypol derivatives that show selectivity for the parasite enzymes. We also report a substrate analogue that unexpectedly binds within the adenine pocket of the co-factor groove. Although these core pharmacophore-like molecules only exhibit low levels of inhibitory activity, these molecular snapshots provide a rational basis for renewed structure-based development of naphthalene-based compounds as anti-malarial agents.</p>

<p>Escherichia coli glycogen synthase (EcGS, EC 2.4.1.21) is a retaining glycosyltransferase (GT) that transfers glucose from adenosine diphosphate glucose to a glucan chain acceptor with retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon. EcGS belongs to the GT-B structural superfamily. Here we report several EcGS x-ray structures that together shed considerable light on the structure and function of these enzymes. The structure of the wild-type enzyme bound to ADP and glucose revealed a 15.2 degrees overall domain-domain closure and provided for the first time the structure of the catalytically active, closed conformation of a glycogen synthase. The main chain carbonyl group of His-161, Arg-300, and Lys-305 are suggested by the structure to act as critical catalytic residues in the transglycosylation. Glu-377, previously thought to be catalytic is found on the alpha-face of the glucose and plays an electrostatic role in the active site and as a glucose ring locator. This is also consistent with the structure of the EcGS(E377A)-ADP-HEPPSO complex where the glucose moiety is either absent or disordered in the active site.</p>

<p>Type IIA topoisomerases both manage the topological state of chromosomal DNA and are the targets of a variety of clinical agents. Bisdioxopiperazines are anticancer agents that associate with ATP-bound eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II) and convert the enzyme into an inactive, salt-stable clamp around DNA. To better understand both topo II and bisdioxopiperazine function, we determined the structures of the adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imino]-triphosphate-bound yeast topo II ATPase region (ScT2-ATPase) alone and complexed with the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187. The drug-free form of the protein is similar in overall fold to the equivalent region of bacterial gyrase but unexpectedly displays significant conformational differences. The ternary drug-bound complex reveals that ICRF-187 acts by an unusual mechanism of inhibition in which the drug does not compete for the ATP-binding pocket, but bridges and stabilizes a transient dimer interface between two ATPase protomers. Our data explain why bisdioxopiperazines target ATP-bound topo II, provide a structural rationale for the effects of certain drug-resistance mutations, and point to regions of bisdioxopiperazines that might be modified to improve or alter drug specificity.</p>

<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalyzes the reversible decarboxylation of oxaloacetic acid with the concomitant transfer of the gamma-phosphate of GTP to form PEP and GDP as the first committed step of gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis. The three structures of the mitochondrial isoform of PEPCK reported are complexed with Mn2+, Mn2+-PEP, or Mn2+-malonate-Mn2+ GDP and provide the first observations of the structure of the mitochondrial isoform and insight into the mechanism of catalysis mediated by this enzyme. The structures show the involvement of the hyper-reactive cysteine (C307) in the coordination of the active site Mn2+. Upon formation of the PEPCK-Mn2+-PEP or PEPCK-Mn2+-malonate-Mn2+ GDP complexes, C307 coordination is lost as the P-loop in which it resides adopts a different conformation. The structures suggest that stabilization of the cysteine-coordinated metal geometry holds the enzyme as a catalytically incompetent metal complex and may represent a previously unappreciated mechanism of regulation. A third conformation of the mobile P-loop in the PEPCK-Mn2+-malonate-Mn2+ GDP complex demonstrates the participation of a previously unrecognized, conserved serine residue (S305) in mediating phosphoryl transfer. The ordering of the mobile active site lid in the PEPCK-Mn2+-malonate-Mn2+ GDP complex yields the first observation of this structural feature and provides additional insight into the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer.</p>

<p>The structural and functional role of conserved residue G86 in HIV-1 protease (PR) was investigated by NMR and crystallographic analyses of substitution mutations of glycine to alanine and serine (PR(G86A) and PR(G86S)). While PR(G86S) had undetectable catalytic activity, PR(G86A) exhibited approximately 6000-fold lower catalytic activity than PR. (1)H-(15)N NMR correlation spectra revealed that PR(G86A) and PR(G86S) are dimeric, exhibiting dimer dissociation constants (K(d)) of approximately 0.5 and approximately 3.2 muM, respectively, which are significantly lower than that seen for PR with R87K mutation (K(d) &gt; 1 mM). Thus, the G86 mutants, despite being partially dimeric under the assay conditions, are defective in catalyzing substrate hydrolysis. NMR spectra revealed no changes in the chemical shifts even in the presence of excess substrate, indicating very poor binding of the substrate. Both NMR chemical shift data and crystal structures of PR(G86A) and PR(G86S) in the presence of active-site inhibitors indicated high structural similarity to previously described PR/inhibitor complexes, except for specific perturbations within the active site loop and around the mutation site. The crystal structures in the presence of the inhibitor showed that the region around residue 86 was connected to the active site by a conserved network of hydrogen bonds, and the two regions moved further apart in the mutants. Overall, in contrast to the role of R87 in contributing significantly to the dimer stability of PR, G86 is likely to play an important role in maintaining the correct geometry of the active site loop in the PR dimer for substrate binding and hydrolysis.

<p>The modular multifunctional protein large T antigen (T-ag) from simian virus 40 orchestrates many of the events needed for replication of the viral double-stranded DNA genome. This protein assembles into single and double hexamers on specific DNA sequences located at the origin of replication. This complicated process begins when the origin-binding domain of large T antigen (T-ag ODB) binds the GAGGC sequences in the central region (site II) of the viral origin of replication. While many of the functions of purified T-ag OBD can be studied in isolation, it is primarily monomeric in solution and cannot assemble into hexamers. To overcome this limitation, the possibility of engineering intermolecular disulfide bonds in the origin-binding domain which could oligomerize in solution was investigated. A recent crystal structure of the wild-type T-ag OBD showed that this domain forms a left-handed spiral in the crystal with six subunits per turn. Therefore, we analyzed the protein interface of this structure and identified two residues that could potentially support an intermolecular disulfide bond if changed to cysteines. SDS-PAGE analysis established that the mutant T-ag OBD formed higher oligomeric products in a redox-dependent manner. In addition, the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structure of the engineered disulfide-linked T-ag OBD is reported, which establishes that oligomerization took place in the expected manner.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of the catalytic core domain of beta-mannanase from the fungus Trichoderma reesei has been determined at a resolution of 1.5 A. The structure was solved using the anomalous scattering from a single non-isomorphous platinum complex with two heavy-metal sites in space group P2(1). The map computed with the experimental phases was enhanced by the application of an automated model building and refinement procedure using the amplitudes and experimental phases as observations. This approach is expected to be of more general application. The structure of the native enzyme and complexes with Tris-HCl and mannobiose are also reported: the mannobiose binds in subsites +1 and +2. The structure is briefly compared with that of the homologous beta-mannanase from the bacterium Thermomonospora fusca.</p>

<p>The reactivity of the [Re(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(2)](+) complex coordinated to the His15 residue of HEW lysozyme is described. In the fully metalated protein (Lys-1), the Re ion retains its reactivity only toward selected ligands, while others induce a ligand-mediated demetalation of the enzyme. It is further shown that some of the complexes that may be "engineered" on the lysozyme do not react with the free protein even if present in solution in excess. The formation of stable metal adducts starting from Lys-1 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.</p>

<p>Cytosine deaminase (CDA) from Escherichia coli was shown to catalyze the deamination of isoguanine (2-oxoadenine) to xanthine. Isoguanine is an oxidation product of adenine in DNA that is mutagenic to the cell. The isoguanine deaminase activity in E. coli was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, and anion exchange chromatography. The active protein was identified by peptide mass fingerprint analysis as cytosine deaminase. The kinetic constants for the deamination of isoguanine at pH 7.7 are as follows: k(cat) = 49 s(-1), K(m) = 72 μM, and k(cat)/K(m) = 6.7 × 10(5) M(-1) s(-1). The kinetic constants for the deamination of cytosine are as follows: k(cat) = 45 s(-1), K(m) = 302 μM, and k(cat)/K(m) = 1.5 × 10(5) M(-1) s(-1). Under these reaction conditions, isoguanine is the better substrate for cytosine deaminase. The three-dimensional structure of CDA was determined with isoguanine in the active site.</p>

<p>The diheme enzyme MauG catalyzes the posttranslational modification of the precursor protein of methylamine dehydrogenase (preMADH) to complete biosynthesis of its protein-derived tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor. Catalysis proceeds through a high valent bis-Fe(IV) redox state and requires long-range electron transfer (ET), as the distance between the modified residues of preMADH and the nearest heme iron of MauG is 19.4 Å. Trp199 of MauG resides at the MauG-preMADH interface, positioned midway between the residues that are modified and the nearest heme. W199F and W199K mutations did not affect the spectroscopic and redox properties of MauG, or its ability to stabilize the bis-Fe(IV) state. Crystal structures of complexes of W199F/K MauG with preMADH showed no significant perturbation of the MauG-preMADH structure or protein interface. However, neither MauG variant was able to synthesize TTQ from preMADH. In contrast, an ET reaction from diferrous MauG to quinone MADH, which does not require the bis-Fe(IV) intermediate, was minimally affected by the W199F/K mutations. W199F/K MauGs were able to oxidize quinol MADH to form TTQ, the putative final two-electron oxidation of the biosynthetic process, but with k(cat)/K(m) values approximately 10% that of wild-type MauG. The differential effects of the W199F/K mutations on these three different reactions are explained by a critical role for Trp199 in mediating multistep hopping from preMADH to bis-Fe(IV) MauG during the long-range ET that is required for TTQ biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Results from a novel approach which uses protein crystallography for the screening of a low affinity inhibitor fragment library are analyzed by comparing the X-ray structures with bound fragments to the structures with the corresponding full length inhibitors. The screen for new phospho-tyrosine mimics binding to the SH2 domain of (pp60)src was initiated because of the limited cell penetration of phosphates. Fragments in our library typically had between 6 and 30 atoms and included compounds which had either millimolar activity in a Biacore assay or were suggested by the ab initio design program LUDI but had no measurable affinity. All identified fragments were located in the phospho-tyrosine pocket. The most promising fragments were successfully used to replace the phospho-tyrosine and resulted in novel nonpeptidic high affinity inhibitors. The significant diversity of successful fragments is reflected in the high flexibility of the phospho-tyrosine pocket. Comparison of the X-ray structures shows that the presence of the H-bond acceptors and not their relative position within the pharmacophore are essential for fragment binding and/or high affinity binding of full length inhibitors. The X-ray data show that the fragments are recognized by forming a complex H-bond network within the phospho-tyrosine pocket of SH2. No fragment structure was found in which this H-bond network was incomplete, and any uncompensated H-bond within the H-bond network leads to a significant decrease in the affinity of full length inhibitors. No correlation between affinity and fragment binding was found for these polar fragments and hence affinity-based screening would have overlooked some interesting starting points for inhibitor design. In contrast, we were unable to identify electron density for hydrophobic fragments, confirming that hydrophobic interactions are important for inhibitor affinity but of minor importance for ligand recognition. Our results suggest that a screening approach using protein crystallography is particularly useful to identify universal fragments for the conserved hydrophilic recognition sites found in target families such as SH2 domains, phosphatases, kinases, proteases, and esterases.</p>

In contrast, we were unable to identify electron density for hydrophobic fragments, confirming that hydrophobic interactions are important for inhibitor affinity but of minor importance for ligand recognition. Our results suggest that a screening approach using protein crystallography is particularly useful to identify universal fragments for the conserved hydrophilic recognition sites found in target families such as SH2 domains, phosphatases, kinases, proteases, and esterases.</p>

<p>Acylaminoacyl peptidase from Aeropyrum pernix is a homodimer that belongs to the prolyl oligopeptidase family. The monomer subunit is composed of one hydrolase and one propeller domain. Previous crystal structure determinations revealed that the propeller domain obstructed the access of substrate to the active site of both subunits. Here we investigated the structure and the kinetics of two mutant enzymes in which the aspartic acid of the catalytic triad was changed to alanine or asparagine. Using different substrates, we have determined the pH dependence of specificity rate constants, the rate-limiting step of catalysis, and the binding of substrates and inhibitors. The catalysis considerably depended both on the kind of mutation and on the nature of the substrate. The results were interpreted in terms of alterations in the position of the catalytic histidine side chain as demonstrated with crystal structure determination of the native and two mutant structures (D524N and D524A). Unexpectedly, in the homodimeric structures, only one subunit displayed the closed form of the enzyme. The other subunit exhibited an open gate to the catalytic site, thus revealing the structural basis that controls the oligopeptidase activity. The open form of the native enzyme displayed the catalytic triad in a distorted, inactive state. The mutations affected the closed, active form of the enzyme, disrupting its catalytic triad. We concluded that the two forms are at equilibrium and the substrates bind by the conformational selection mechanism.</p>

<p>Results from a novel approach which uses protein crystallography for the screening of a low affinity inhibitor fragment library are analyzed by comparing the X-ray structures with bound fragments to the structures with the corresponding full length inhibitors. The screen for new phospho-tyrosine mimics binding to the SH2 domain of (pp60)src was initiated because of the limited cell penetration of phosphates. Fragments in our library typically had between 6 and 30 atoms and included compounds which had either millimolar activity in a Biacore assay or were suggested by the ab initio design program LUDI but had no measurable affinity. All identified fragments were located in the phospho-tyrosine pocket. The most promising fragments were successfully used to replace the phospho-tyrosine and resulted in novel nonpeptidic high affinity inhibitors. The significant diversity of successful fragments is reflected in the high flexibility of the phospho-tyrosine pocket. Comparison of the X-ray structures shows that the presence of the H-bond acceptors and not their relative position within the pharmacophore are essential for fragment binding and/or high affinity binding of full length inhibitors. The X-ray data show that the fragments are recognized by forming a complex H-bond network within the phospho-tyrosine pocket of SH2. No fragment structure was found in which this H-bond network was incomplete, and any uncompensated H-bond within the H-bond network leads to a significant decrease in the affinity of full length inhibitors. No correlation between affinity and fragment binding was found for these polar fragments and hence affinity-based screening would have overlooked some interesting starting points for inhibitor design.

<p>TREX1 is the most abundant mammalian 3' --&gt; 5' DNA exonuclease. It has been described to form part of the SET complex and is responsible for the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome in humans. Here we show that the exonuclease activity is correlated to the binding preferences toward certain DNA sequences. In particular, we have found three motifs that are selected, GAG, ACA, and CTGC. To elucidate how the discrimination occurs, we determined the crystal structures of two murine TREX1 complexes, with a nucleotide product of the exonuclease reaction, and with a single-stranded DNA substrate. Using confocal microscopy, we observed TREX1 both in nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular compartments. Remarkably, the presence of TREX1 in the nucleus requires the loss of a C-terminal segment, which we named leucine-rich repeat 3. Furthermore, we detected the presence of a conserved proline-rich region on the surface of TREX1. This observation points to interactions with proline-binding domains. The potential interacting motif "PPPVPRPP" does not contain aromatic residues and thus resembles other sequences that select SH3 and/or Group 2 WW domains. By means of nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments, we show that, indeed, a polyproline peptide derived from the murine TREX1 sequence interacted with the WW2 domain of the elongation transcription factor CA150. Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed this interaction with the full-length TREX1 protein, thereby suggesting that TREX1 participates in more functional complexes than previously thought.</p>

<p>Hydrogen atoms represent about half of the total number of atoms in proteins and are often involved in substrate recognition and catalysis. Unfortunately, X-ray protein crystallography at usual resolution fails to access directly their positioning, mainly because light atoms display weak contributions to diffraction. However, sub-Ångstrom diffraction data, careful modeling and a proper refinement strategy can allow the positioning of a significant part of hydrogen atoms.</p>

<p>An ever-increasing number of metalloproteins are being discovered that play essential roles in physiological processes. Inhibitors of these proteins have significant potential for the treatment of human disease, but clinical success of these compounds has been limited. Herein, zinc(II)-dependent metalloprotein inhibitors in clinical use are reviewed, and the potential for using novel metal-binding groups (MBGs) in the design of these inhibitors is discussed. By using human carbonic anhydrase II as a model system, the nuances of MBG-metal interactions in the context of a protein environment can be probed. Understanding how metal coordination influences inhibitor binding may help in the design of new therapeutics targeting metalloproteins. </p>

<p>Cellulase E4 from Thermomonospora fusca is unusual in that it has characteristics of both exo- and endo-cellulases. Here we report the crystal structure of a 68K M(r) fragment of E4 (E4-68) at 1.9 A resolution. E4-68 contains both a family 9 catalytic domain, exhibiting an (alpha/alpha)6 barrel fold, and a family III cellulose binding domain, having an antiparallel beta-sandwich fold. While neither of these folds is novel, E4-68 provides the first cellulase structure having interacting catalytic and cellulose binding domains. The complexes of E4-68 with cellopentaose, cellotriose and cellobiose reveal conformational changes associated with ligand binding and allow us to propose a catalytic mechanism for family 9 enzymes. We also provide evidence that E4 has two novel characteristics: first it combines exo- and endo-activities and second, when it functions as an exo-cellulase, it cleaves off cellotetraose units.</p>

<p>The biosynthetic shikimate pathway consists of seven enzymes that catalyze sequential reactions to generate chorismate, a critical branch point in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids. The third enzyme in the pathway, dehydroquinate dehydratase (DHQD), catalyzes the dehydration of 3-dehydroquinate to 3-dehydroshikimate. We present three crystal structures of the type I DHQD from the intestinal pathogens Clostridium difficile and Salmonella enterica. Structures of the enzyme with substrate and covalent pre- and post-dehydration reaction intermediates provide snapshots of successive steps along the type I DHQD-catalyzed reaction coordinate. These structures reveal that the position of the substrate within the active site does not appreciably change upon Schiff base formation. The intermediate state structures reveal a reaction state-dependent behavior of His-143 in which the residue adopts a conformation proximal to the site of catalytic dehydration only when the leaving group is present. We speculate that His-143 is likely to assume differing catalytic roles in each of its observed conformations. One conformation of His-143 positions the residue for the formation/hydrolysis of the covalent Schiff base intermediates, whereas the other conformation positions the residue for a role in the catalytic dehydration event. The fact that the shikimate pathway is absent from humans makes the enzymes of the pathway potential targets for the development of non-toxic antimicrobials. The structures and mechanistic insight presented here may inform the design of type I DHQD enzyme inhibitors.</p>

<p>Biochemical and X-ray crystallographic studies confirmed that hydroxyquinoline derivatives identified by virtual screening were actually covalent inhibitors of the MIF tautomerase. Adducts were formed by N-alkylation of the Pro-1 at the catalytic site with a loss of an amino group of the inhibitor.</p>

<p>Human purine de novo synthesis pathway contains several multi-functional enzymes, one of which, tri-functional GART, contains three enzymatic activities in a single polypeptide chain. We have solved structures of two domains bearing separate catalytic functions: glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase and aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase. Structures are compared with those of homologous enzymes from prokaryotes and analyzed in terms of the catalytic mechanism. We also report small angle X-ray scattering models for the full-length protein. These models are consistent with the enzyme forming a dimer through the middle domain. The protein has an approximate seesaw geometry where terminal enzyme units display high mobility owing to flexible linker segments. This resilient seesaw shape may facilitate internal substrate/product transfer or forwarding to other enzymes in the pathway.</p>

<p>We report here crystal structures of human RNase H1 complexed with an RNA/DNA substrate. Unlike B. halodurans RNase H1, human RNase H1 has a basic protrusion, which forms a DNA-binding channel and together with the conserved phosphate-binding pocket confers specificity for the B form and 2'-deoxy DNA. The RNA strand is recognized by four consecutive 2'-OH groups and cleaved by a two-metal ion mechanism. Although RNase H1 is overall positively charged, the substrate interface is neutral to acidic in character, which likely contributes to the catalytic specificity. Positions of the scissile phosphate and two catalytic metal ions are interdependent and highly coupled. Modeling of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) with RNA/DNA in its RNase H active site suggests that the substrate cannot simultaneously occupy the polymerase active site and must undergo a conformational change to toggle between the two catalytic centers. The region that accommodates this conformational change offers a target to develop HIV-specific inhibitors.</p>

<p>Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKO) is a flavoenzyme, which irreversibly degrades the plant hormones cytokinins and thereby participates in their homeostasis. Several synthetic cytokinins including urea derivatives are known CKO inhibitors but structural data explaining enzyme-inhibitor interactions are lacking. Thus, an inhibitory study with numerous urea derivatives was undertaken using the maize enzyme (ZmCKO1) and the crystal structure of ZmCKO1 in a complex with N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU) was solved. CPPU binds in a planar conformation and competes for the same binding site with natural substrates like N(6)-(2-isopentenyl)adenine (iP) and zeatin (Z). Nitrogens at the urea backbone are hydrogen bonded to the putative active site base Asp169. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis of L492 and E381 residues involved in the inhibitor binding was performed. The crystal structures of L492A mutant in a complex with CPPU and N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-benzylurea (CPBU) were solved and confirm the importance of a stacking interaction between the 2-chloro-4-pyridinyl ring of the inhibitor and the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor. Amino derivatives like N-(2-amino-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (APPU) inhibited ZmCKO1 more efficiently than CPPU, as opposed to the inhibition of E381A/S mutants, emphasizing the importance of this residue for inhibitor binding. As highly specific CKO inhibitors without undesired side effects are of major interest for physiological studies, all studied compounds were further analyzed for cytokinin activity in the Amaranthus bioassay and for binding to the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors AHK3 and AHK4. By contrast to CPPU itself, APPU and several benzylureas bind only negligibly to the receptors and exhibit weak cytokinin activity.</p>

<p>We have obtained the single-crystal X-ray crystallographic structures of the bisphosphonates [(1-isoquinolinylamino)methylene]-1,1-bisphosphonate and [[(5-chloro-2-pyridinyl)amino]methylene]-1,1-bisphosphonate, bound to the enzyme 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR, EC 1.1.1.267, also known as 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate synthase), an important target for the development of antimalarial drugs. Our results indicate that both bisphosphonates bind into the fosmidomycin binding site. The aromatic groups are in a shallow hydrophobic pocket, and the phosphonate groups are involved in electrostatic interactions with Mg2+ or a cluster of carboxylic acid groups and lysine while the fosmidomycin phosphonate-binding site is occupied by a sulfate ion (as also observed in the DXR/NADP+ structure). The availability of these two new crystal structures opens up the possibility of the further development of bisphosphonates and related systems as DXR inhibitors and, potentially, as antiinfective agents.</p>

<p>Triclosan, a well-known inhibitor of Enoyl Acyl Carrier Protein Reductase (ENR) from several pathogenic organisms, is a promising lead compound to design effective drugs. We have solved the X-ray crystal structures of Plasmodium falciparum ENR in complex with triclosan variants having different substituted and unsubstituted groups at different key functional locations. The structures revealed that 4 and 2' substituted compounds have more interactions with the protein, cofactor, and solvents when compared with triclosan. New water molecules were found to interact with some of these inhibitors. Substitution at the 2' position of triclosan caused the relocation of a conserved water molecule, leading to an additional hydrogen bond with the inhibitor. This observation can help in conserved water-based inhibitor design. 2' and 4' unsubstituted compounds showed a movement away from the hydrophobic pocket to compensate for the interactions made by the halogen groups of triclosan. This compound also makes additional interactions with the protein and cofactor which compensate for the lost interactions due to the unsubstitution at 2' and 4'. In cell culture, this inhibitor shows less potency, which indicates that the chlorines at 2' and 4' positions increase the ability of the inhibitor to cross multilayered membranes. This knowledge helps us to modify the different functional groups of triclosan to get more potent inhibitors.</p>

<p>Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT; EC 2.1.2.1) catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine with transfer of the serine side chain one-carbon group to tetrahydropteroylglutamate (H(4)PteGlu), and also the conversion of 5,10-methenyl-H(4)PteGlu to 5-formyl-H(4)PteGlu. In the cell, H(4)PteGlu carries a poly-gamma-glutamyl tail of at least 3 glutamyl residues that is required for physiological activity. This study combines solution binding and mutagenesis studies with crystallographic structure determination to identify the extended binding site for tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamate on rabbit cytosolic SHMT. Equilibrium binding and kinetic measurements of H(4)PteGlu(3) and H(4)PteGlu(5) with wild-type and Lys --&gt; Gln or Glu site mutant homotetrameric rabbit cytosolic SHMTs identified lysine residues that contribute to the binding of the polyglutamate tail. The crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with 5-formyl-H(4)PteGlu(3) confirms the solution data and indicates that the conformation of the pteridine ring and its interactions with the enzyme differ slightly from those observed in complexes of the monoglutamate cofactor. The polyglutamate chain, which does not contribute to catalysis, exists in multiple conformations in each of the two occupied binding sites and appears to be bound by the electrostatic field created by the cationic residues, with only limited interactions with specific individual residues.</p>

<p>Cerulenin is a fungal toxin that inhibits both eukaryotic and prokaryotic ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases or condensing enzymes. It has been used experimentally to treat cancer and obesity, and is a potent inhibitor of bacterial growth. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance to cerulenin and similar compounds is thus highly relevant for human health. We have previously described a Bacillus subtilis cerulenin-resistant strain, expressing a point-mutated condensing enzyme FabF (FabF[I108F]) (i.e. FabF with isoleucine 108 substituted by phenylalanine). We now report the crystal structures of wild-type FabF from B. subtilis, both alone and in complex with cerulenin, as well as of the FabF[I108F] mutant protein. The three-dimensional structure of FabF[I108F] constitutes the first atomic model of a condensing enzyme that remains active in the presence of the inhibitor. Soaking the mycotoxin into preformed wild-type FabF crystals allowed for noncovalent binding into its specific pocket within the FabF core. Interestingly, only co-crystallization experiments allowed us to trap the covalent complex. Our structure shows that the covalent bond between Cys163 and cerulenin, in contrast to that previously proposed, implicates carbon C3 of the inhibitor. The similarities between Escherichia coli and B. subtilis FabF structures did not explain the reported inability of ecFabF[I108F] (i.e. FabF from Escherichia coli with isoleucine 108 substituted by phenylalanine) to elongate medium and long-chain acyl-ACPs. We now demonstrate that the E. coli modified enzyme efficiently catalyzes the synthesis of medium and long-chain ketoacyl-ACPs. We also characterized another cerulenin-insensitive form of FabF, conferring a different phenotype in B. subtilis. The structural, biochemical and physiological data presented, shed light on the mechanisms of FabF catalysis and resistance to cerulenin.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of a mutant hen egg white lysozyme, in which the key catalytic residue aspartic acid 52 has been changed to a serine residue (D52S HEWL), has been determined and refined to a crystallographic R value of 0.173 for all data F &gt; 0 between 8 and 1.9 A resolution. The D52S HEWL structure is very similar to the native HEWL structure (r.m.s. deviation of main-chain atoms 0.20 A). Small shifts that result from the change in hydrogen bonding pattern on substitution of Asp by Ser were observed in the loop between beta-strands in the region of residues 46 to 49. D52S HEWL exhibits less than 1% activity against the bacterial cell wall substrate. Cocrystallisation experiments with the hexasaccharide substrate beta(1-4) polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc6) resulted in crystals between 5 days and 14 days after the initial mixing of enzyme and substrate. Analysis by laser absorption mass spectrometry of the oligosaccharides present after incubation with native and D52S HEWL under conditions similar to those used for crystal growth showed that after 14 days with native HEWL complete catalysis to GlcNAc3. GlcNAc2 and GlcNac had occurred but with D52S HEWL only partial catalysis to the major products GlcNAc4 and GlcNAc2 had occurred and at least 50% of the GlcNAc6 remained intact. X-ray analysis of the D52S-oligosaccharide complex crystals showed that they contained the product GlcNAc4. The structure of the D52S HEWL-GlcNAc4 complex has been determined and refined to an R value of 0.160 for data between 8 and 2 A resolution. GlcNAc4 occupies sites A to D in the active site cleft. Careful refinement and examination of 2Fo-Fc electron density maps showed that the sugar in site D has the sofa conformation, a conformation previously observed with the HEWL complex with tetra-N-acetylglucosamine lactone transition state analogue, the HEWL complex with the cell wall trisaccharide and the phage T4 lysozyme complex with a cell wall product. The semi-axial C(5)-C(6) geometry of the sofa is stabilised by hydrogen bonds from the O-6 hydroxyl group to the main-chain N of Val109 and main-chain O of Ala107. The sugar in site D adopts the alpha configuration, seemingly in conflict with the observation that the hydrolysis of beta (1-4) glycosidie linkage by HEWL proceeds with 99.9% retention of beta-configuration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</p>

<p>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step in methane biogenesis: the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (methyl-SCoM) by coenzyme B (CoBSH) to methane and a heterodisulfide (CoBS-SCoM). Crystallographic studies show that the active site is deeply buried within the enzyme and contains a highly reduced nickel-tetrapyrrole, coenzyme F(430). Methyl-SCoM must enter the active site prior to CoBSH, as species derived from methyl-SCoM are always observed bound to the F(430) nickel in the deepest part of the 30 A long substrate channel that leads from the protein surface to the active site. The seven-carbon mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoBSH binds within a 16 A predominantly hydrophobic part of the channel close to F(430), with the CoBSH thiolate lying closest to the nickel at a distance of 8.8 A. It has previously been suggested that binding of CoBSH initiates catalysis by inducing a conformational change that moves methyl-SCoM closer to the nickel promoting cleavage of the C-S bond of methyl-SCoM. In order to better understand the structural role of CoBSH early in the MCR mechanism, we have determined crystal structures of MCR in complex with four different CoBSH analogues: pentanoyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, and nonanoyl derivatives of CoBSH (CoB(5)SH, CoB(6)SH, CoB(8)SH, and CoB(9)SH, respectively). The data presented here reveal that the shorter CoB(5)SH mercaptoalkanoyl chain overlays with that of CoBSH but terminates two units short of the CoBSH thiolate position. In contrast, the mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoB(6)SH adopts a different conformation, such that its thiolate is coincident with the position of the CoBSH thiolate. This is consistent with the observation that CoB(6)SH is a slow substrate. A labile water in the substrate channel was found to be a sensitive indicator for the presence of CoBSH and HSCoM. The longer CoB(8)SH and CoB(9)SH analogues can be accommodated in the active site through exclusion of this water. These analogues react with Ni(III)-methyl, a proposed MCR catalytic intermediate of methanogenesis. The CoB(8)SH thiolate is 2.6 A closer to the nickel than that of CoBSH, but the additional carbon of CoB(9)SH only decreases the nickel thiolate distance a further 0.3 A. Although the analogues do not induce any structural changes in the substrate channel, the thiolates appear to preferentially bind at two distinct positions in the channel, one being the previously observed CoBSH thiolate position and the other being at a hydrophobic annulus of residues that lines the channel proximal to the nickel.</p>

The CoB(8)SH thiolate is 2.6 A closer to the nickel than that of CoBSH, but the additional carbon of CoB(9)SH only decreases the nickel thiolate distance a further 0.3 A. Although the analogues do not induce any structural changes in the substrate channel, the thiolates appear to preferentially bind at two distinct positions in the channel, one being the previously observed CoBSH thiolate position and the other being at a hydrophobic annulus of residues that lines the channel proximal to the nickel.</p>

<p>The homologous human ABO(H) A and B blood group glycosyltransferases GTA and GTB have two mobile polypeptide loops surrounding their active sites that serve to allow substrate access and product egress and to recognize and sequester substrates for catalysis. Previous studies have established that these enzymes can move from the "open" state to the "semi-closed" then "closed" states in response to addition of a substrate. The contribution of electrostatic interactions to these conformational changes has now been demonstrated by the determination at various pH of the structures of GTA, GTB and the chimeric enzyme ABBA. At near-neutral pH, GTA displays the closed state in which both mobile loops order around the active site, whereas ABBA and GTB display the open state. At low pH, the apparent protonation of the DXD motif in GTA leads to the expulsion of the donor analog to yield the open state, whereas at high pH, both ABBA and GTB form the semi-closed state in which the first mobile loop becomes an ordered α-helix. Step-wise deprotonation of GTB in increments of 0.5 between pH 6.5 and 10.0 shows that helix ordering is gradual, which indicates that the formation of the semi-closed state is dependent on electrostatic forces consistent with the binding of substrate. Spectropolarimetric studies of the corresponding stand-alone peptide in solution reveal no tendency toward helix formation from pH 7.0 to 10.0, which shows that pH-dependent stability is a product of the larger protein environment and underlines the importance of substrate in active site ordering. </p>

<p>To achieve accurate DNA synthesis, DNA polymerases must rapidly sample and discriminate against incorrect nucleotides. Here we report the crystal structure of a high fidelity DNA polymerase I bound to DNA primer-template caught in the act of binding a mismatched (dG:dTTP) nucleoside triphosphate. The polymerase adopts a conformation in between the previously established "open" and "closed" states. In this "ajar" conformation, the template base has moved into the insertion site but misaligns an incorrect nucleotide relative to the primer terminus. The displacement of a conserved active site tyrosine in the insertion site by the template base is accommodated by a distinctive kink in the polymerase O helix, resulting in a partially open ternary complex. We suggest that the ajar conformation allows the template to probe incoming nucleotides for complementarity before closure of the enzyme around the substrate. Based on solution fluorescence, kinetics, and crystallographic analyses of wild-type and mutant polymerases reported here, we present a three-state reaction pathway in which nucleotides either pass through this intermediate conformation to the closed conformation and catalysis or are misaligned within the intermediate, leading to destabilization of the closed conformation.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase III alpha subunit reveals that the structure of the catalytic domain of the eubacterial replicative polymerase is unrelated to that of the eukaryotic replicative polymerase but rather belongs to the Polbeta-like nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. A model of the polymerase complexed with both DNA and beta-sliding clamp interacting with a reoriented binding domain and internal beta binding site was constructed that is consistent with existing biochemical data. Within the crystal, two C-terminal domains are interacting through a surface that is larger than many dimer interfaces. Since replicative polymerases of eubacteria and eukaryotes/archaea are not homologous, the nature of the replicative polymerase in the last common ancestor is unknown. Although other possibilities have been proposed, the plausibility of a ribozyme DNA polymerase should be considered.</p>

<p>The catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a serine/threonine kinase responsible for most of the effects of cAMP signaling, and PKA serves as a prototype for the entire kinase family. Despite multiple studies of PKA, the steps involved in phosphoryl transfer, the roles of the catalytically essential magnesium ions, and the processes that govern the rate-limiting step of ADP release are unresolved. Here we identified conditions that yielded slow phosphoryl transfer of the γ-phosphate from the generally nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, adenosine-5'-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (AMP-PNP), onto a substrate peptide within protein crystals. By trapping both products in the crystal lattice, we now have a complete resolution profile of all the catalytic steps. One crystal structure refined to 1.55 Å resolution shows two states of the protein with 55% displaying intact AMP-PNP and an unphosphorylated substrate and 45% displaying transfer of the γ-phosphate of AMP-PNP onto the substrate peptide yielding AMP-PN and a phosphorylated substrate. Another structure refined to 2.15 Å resolution displays complete phosphoryl transfer to the substrate. These structures, in addition to trapping both products in the crystal lattice, implicate one magnesium ion, previously termed Mg2, as the more stably bound ion. Following phosphoryl transfer, Mg2 recruits a water molecule to retain an octahedral coordination geometry suggesting the strong binding character of this magnesium ion, and Mg2 remains in the active site following complete phosphoryl transfer while Mg1 is expelled. Loss of Mg1 may thus be an important part of the rate-limiting step of ADP release.</p>

<p>The allosteric regulation of substrate channeling in tryptophan synthase involves ligand-mediated allosteric signaling that switches the α- and β-subunits between open (low activity) and closed (high activity) conformations. This switching prevents the escape of the common intermediate, indole, and synchronizes the α- and β-catalytic cycles. (19)F NMR studies of bound α-site substrate analogues, N-(4'-trifluoromethoxybenzoyl)-2-aminoethyl phosphate (F6) and N-(4'-trifluoromethoxybenzenesulfonyl)-2-aminoethyl phosphate (F9), were found to be sensitive NMR probes of β-subunit conformation. Both the internal and external aldimine F6 complexes gave a single bound peak at the same chemical shift, while α-aminoacrylate and quinonoid F6 complexes all gave a different bound peak shifted by +1.07 ppm. The F9 complexes exhibited similar behavior, but with a corresponding shift of -0.12 ppm. X-ray crystal structures show the F6 and F9 CF3 groups located at the α-β subunit interface and report changes in both the ligand conformation and the surrounding protein microenvironment. Ab initio computational modeling suggests that the change in (19)F chemical shift results primarily from changes in the α-site ligand conformation. Structures of α-aminoacrylate F6 and F9 complexes and quinonoid F6 and F9 complexes show the α- and β-subunits have closed conformations wherein access of ligands into the α- and β-sites from solution is blocked. Internal and external aldimine structures show the α- and β-subunits with closed and open global conformations, respectively. These results establish that β-subunits exist in two global conformational states, designated open, where the β-sites are freely accessible to substrates, and closed, where the β-site portal into solution is blocked. Switching between these conformations is critically important for the αβ-catalytic cycle. </p>

<p>Many bacteria form Gln-tRNA(Gln) and Asn-tRNA(Asn) by conversion of the misacylated Glu-tRNA(Gln) and Asp-tRNA(Asn) species catalyzed by the GatCAB amidotransferase in the presence of ATP and an amide donor (glutamine or asparagine). Here, we report the crystal structures of GatCAB from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, complexed with glutamine, asparagine, aspartate, ADP, or ATP. In contrast to the Staphylococcus aureus GatCAB, the A. aeolicus enzyme formed acyl-enzyme intermediates with either glutamine or asparagine, in line with the equally facile use by the amidotransferase of these amino acids as amide donors in the transamidation reaction. A water-filled ammonia channel is open throughout the length of the A. aeolicus GatCAB from the GatA active site to the synthetase catalytic pocket in the B-subunit. A non-catalytic Zn(2+) site in the A. aeolicus GatB stabilizes subunit contacts and the ammonia channel. Judged from sequence conservation in the known GatCAB sequences, the Zn(2+) binding motif was likely present in the primordial GatB/E, but became lost in certain lineages (e.g., S. aureus GatB). Two divalent metal binding sites, one permanent and the other transient, are present in the catalytic pocket of the A. aeolicus GatB. The two sites enable GatCAB to first phosphorylate the misacylated tRNA substrate and then amidate the activated intermediate to form the cognate products, Gln-tRNA(Gln) or Asn-tRNA(Asn).</p>

<p>Cellulose is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in nature and microorganisms have developed a comprehensive system for enzymatic breakdown of this ubiquitous carbon source, a subject of much interest in the biotechnology industry. Rhodothermus marinus produces a hyperthermostable cellulase, with a temperature optimum of more than 90 degrees C, the structure of which is presented here to 1.8 A resolution. The enzyme has been classified into glycoside hydrolase family 12; this is the first structure of a thermophilic member of this family to have been solved. The beta-jelly roll fold observed has identical topology to those of the two mesophilic members of the family whose structures have been elucidated previously. A Hepes buffer molecule bound in the active site may have triggered a conformational change to an active configuration as the two catalytic residues Glu124 and Glu207, together with dependent residues, are observed in a conformation similar to that seen in the structure of Streptomyces lividans CelB2 complexed with an inhibitor. The structural similarity between this cellulase and the mesophilic enzymes serves to highlight features that may be responsible for its thermostability, chiefly an increase in ion pair number and the considerable stabilisation of a mobile region seen in S. lividans CelB2. Additional aromatic residues in the active site region may also contribute to the difference in thermophilicity.</p>

<p>The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans expresses 18 cyclophilin isoforms, eight of which are conserved single domain forms, comprising two closely related secreted or type B forms (CYP-5 and CYP-6). Recombinant CYP-5 has been purified, crystallised and the X-ray structure solved to a resolution of 1.75A. The detailed molecular architecture most strongly resembles the structure of human cyclophilin B with conserved changes in loop structure and N and C-terminal extensions. Interestingly, the active site pocket is occupied by a molecule of dithiothreitol though this has little effect on the geometry of the active site which is similar to other cyclophilin structures. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of CYP-5 has been characterised against the substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, and gives a k(cat)/K(m) value of 3.6x10(6)M(-1)s(-1) that compares with a value of 6.3x10(6)M(-1)s(-1) for human cyclophilin B. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A binds and inhibits CYP-5 with an IC(50) value of 50nM, which is comparable to the value of 84nM found for human cyclophilin B. CYP-6 has 67% sequence identity with CYP-5 and a molecular model was built based on the CYP-5 crystal structure. The model shows that CYP-5 and CYP-6 are likely to have very similar structures, but with a markedly increased number of negative charges distributed around the surface of CYP-6. The spatial expression patterns of the cyclophilin B isoforms were examined using transgenic animals carrying a LacZ reporter fusion to these genes, and both cyp-5 and cyp-6 are found to be expressed in an overlapping fashion in the nematode gut. The temporal expression pattern of cyp-5 was further determined and revealed a constitutive expression pattern, with highest abundance levels being found in the embryo.</p>

<p>Fragment-based lead discovery has been applied to urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). The (R)-enantiomer of the orally active drug mexiletine 5 (a fragment hit from X-ray crystallographic screening) was the chemical starting point. Structure-aided design led to elaborated inhibitors that retained the key interactions of (R)-5 while gaining extra potency by simultaneously occupying neighboring regions of the active site. Subsequent optimization led to 15, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of uPA.</p>

<p>GDP-mannose-3',5'-epimerase (GME) from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzes the epimerization of both the 3' and 5' positions of GDP-alpha-D-mannose to yield GDP-beta-L-galactose. Production of the C5' epimer of GDP-alpha-D-mannose, GDP-beta-L-gulose, has also been reported. The reaction occurs as part of vitamin C biosynthesis in plants. We have determined structures of complexes of GME with GDP-alpha-D-mannose, GDP-beta-L-galactose, and a mixture of GDP-beta-L-gulose with GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose to resolutions varying from 2.0 to 1.4 A. The enzyme has the classical extended short-chain dehydratase/reductase (SDR) fold. We have confirmed that GME establishes an equilibrium between two products, GDP-beta-L-galactose and GDP-beta-L-gulose. The reaction proceeds by C4' oxidation of GDP-alpha-D-mannose followed by epimerization of the C5' position to give GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose. This intermediate is either reduced to give GDP-beta-L-gulose or the C3' position is epimerized to give GDP-beta-L-4-keto-galactose, then C4' is reduced to GDP-beta-L-galactose. The combination of oxidation, epimerization, and reduction in a single active site is unusual. Structural analysis coupled to site-directed mutagenesis suggests C145 and K217 as the acid/base pair responsible for both epimerizations. On the basis of the structure of the GDP-beta-L-gulose/GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose co-complex, we predict that a ring flip occurs during the first epimerization and that a boat intermediate is likely for the second epimerization. Comparison of GME with other SDR enzymes known to abstract a protein alpha to the keto function of a carbohydrate identifies key common features.</p>

<p>The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have been characterized in complex with a variety of inhibitors, but the majority of structures solved are in the inactive form. We have solved the structures of six inhibitors in both the monomeric CDK2 and binary CDK2/cyclinA complexes and demonstrate that significant differences in ligand binding occur depending on the activation state. The binding mode of two ligands in particular varies substantially in active and inactive CDK2. Furthermore, energetic analysis of CDK2/cyclin/inhibitors demonstrates that a good correlation exists between the in vitro potency and the calculated energies of interaction, but no such relationship exists for CDK2/inhibitor structures. These results confirm that monomeric CDK2 ligand complexes do not fully reflect active conformations, revealing significant implications for inhibitor design while also suggesting that the monomeric CDK2 conformation can be selectively inhibited.</p>

<p>Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the active vitamer of vitamin B6 and acts as an essential cofactor in many aspects of amino acid and sugar metabolism. The virulence and survival of pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis depend on PLP, and deficiencies in humans have also been associated with neurological disorders and inflammation. While PLP can be synthesized by a de novo pathway in bacteria and plants, most higher organisms rely on a salvage pathway that phosphorylates either pyridoxal (PL) or its related vitamers, pyridoxine (PN) and pyridoxamine (PM). PL kinases (PLKs) are essential for this phosphorylation step and are thus of major importance for cellular viability. We recently identified a pyridoxal kinase (SaPLK) as a target of the natural product antibiotic rugulactone (Ru) in Staphylococcus aureus. Surprisingly, Ru selectively modified SaPLK not at the active site cysteine, but on a remote cysteine residue. Based on structural and biochemical studies, we now provide insight into an unprecedented dual Cys charge relay network that is mandatory for PL phosphorylation. The key component is the reactive Cys 110 residue in the lid region that forms a hemithioactetal intermediate with the 4'-aldehyde of PL. This hemithioacetal, in concert with the catalytic Cys 214, increases the nucleophilicity of the PL 5'-OH group for the inline displacement reaction with the γ-phosphate of ATP. A closer inspection of related enzymes reveals that Cys 110 is conserved and thus serves as a characteristic mechanistic feature for a dual-function ribokinase subfamily herein termed CC-PLKs. </p>

<p>Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) is the key enzyme responsible for initiation of base excision repair. We have used both kinetic and binding assays for comparative analysis of UNG enzymes from humans and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Steady-state fluorescence assays showed that hUNG has a much higher specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m)) compared with the viral enzyme due to a lower K(m). The binding of UNG to DNA was also studied using a catalytically inactive mutant of UNG and non-cleavable substrate analogs (2'-deoxypseudouridine and 2'-alpha-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine). Equilibrium DNA binding revealed that both human and HSV-1 UNG enzymes bind to abasic DNA and both substrate analogs more weakly than to uracil-containing DNA. Structure determination of HSV-1 D88N/H210N UNG in complex with uracil revealed detailed information on substrate binding. Together, these results suggest that a significant proportion of the binding energy is provided by specific interactions with the target uracil. The kinetic parameters for human UNG indicate that it is likely to have activity against both U.A and U.G mismatches in vivo. Weak binding to abasic DNA also suggests that UNG activity is unlikely to be coupled to the subsequent common steps of base excision repair.</p>

<p>γ-Butyrobetaine hydroxylase (BBOX) catalyzes the conversion of gamma butyrobetaine (GBB) to l-carnitine, which is involved in the generation of metabolic energy from long-chain fatty acids. BBOX inhibitor 3-(1,1,1-trimethylhydrazin-1-ium-2-yl)propanoate (mildronate), which is an approved, clinically used cardioprotective drug, is a relatively poor BBOX inhibitor and requires high daily doses. In this paper we describe the design, synthesis, and properties of 51 compounds, which include both GBB and mildronate analogues. We have discovered novel BBOX inhibitors with improved IC50 values; the best examples are in the nanomolar range and about 2 orders of magnitude better when compared to mildronate. For six inhibitors, crystal structures in complex with BBOX have been solved to explain their activities and pave the way for further inhibitor design. </p>

<p>Peroxidatic activation of the anti-tuberculosis pro-drug isoniazid by Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase (KatG) is regulated by gating residues of a heme access channel. The steric restriction at the bottleneck of this channel is alleviated by replacement of residue Asp137 with Ser, according to crystallographic and kinetic studies. </p>

<p>In order to produce a more potent replacement for trimethoprim (TMP) used as a therapy for Pneumocystis pneumonia and targets dihydrofolate reductase from Pneumocystis jirovecii (pjDHFR), it is necessary to understand the determinants of potency and selectivity against DHFR from the mammalian host and fungal pathogen cells. To this end, active site residues in human (h) DHFR were replaced with those from pjDHFR. Structural data are reported for two complexes of TMP with the double mutants Gln35Ser/Asn64Phe (Q35S/N64F) and Gln35Lys/Asn64Phe (Q35K/N64F) of hDHFR that unexpectedly show evidence for the binding of two molecules of TMP: one molecule that binds in the normal folate binding site and the second molecule that binds in a novel subpocket site such that the mutated residue Phe64 is involved in van der Waals contacts to the trimethoxyphenyl ring of the second TMP molecule. Kinetic data for the binding of TMP to hDHFR and pjDHFR reveal an 84-fold selectivity of TMP against pjDHFR (K(i) 49 nM) compared to hDHFR (K(i) 4093 nM). Two mutants that contain one substitution from pj--and one from the closely related Pneumocystis carinii DHFR (pcDHFR) (Q35K/N64F and Q35S/N64F) show K(i) values of 593 and 617 nM, respectively; these K(i) values are well above both the K(i) for pjDHFR and are similar to pcDHFR (Q35K/N64F and Q35S/N64F) (305nM). These results suggest that active site residues 35 and 64 play key roles in determining selectivity for pneumocystis DHFR, but that other residues contribute to the unique binding of inhibitors to these enzymes.</p>

<p>Structural data are reported for the first examples of the tetrahydroquinazoline antifolate (6R,6S)-2,4-diamino-6-(1-indolinomethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazoline (1) and its trimethoxy analogue (6R,6S)-2,4-diamino-6-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazoline (2) as inhibitor complexes with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from human (hDHFR) and Pneumocystis carinii (pcDHFR) sources. The indoline analogue (1) was crystallized as ternary complexes with NADPH and hDHFR (1.9 A resolution) and pcDHFR (2.3 A resolution), while the trimethoxy quinazoline analogue (2) was crystallized as a binary complex with hDHFR in two polymorphic rhombohedral R3 lattices: R3(1) to 1.8 A resolution and R3(2) to 2.0 A resolution. Structural analysis of these potent and selective DHFR-inhibitor complexes revealed preferential binding of the 6S-equatorial isomer in each structure. This configuration is similar to that of the natural tetrahydrofolate substrate; that is, 6S. These data also show that in both the hDHFR and pcDHFR ternary complexes with (1) the indoline ring is partially disordered, with two static conformations that differ between structures. These conformers also differ from that observed for the trimethoxybenzyl ring of tetrahydroquinazoline (2). There is also a correlation between the disorder of the flexible loop 23 and the disorder of the cofactor nicotinamide ribose ring in the pcDHFR-NADPH-(1) ternary complex. Comparison of the Toxoplasma gondii DHFR (tgDHFR) sequence with those of other DHFRs provides insight into the role of sequence and conformation in inhibitor-binding preferences which may aid in the design of novel antifolates with specific DHFR selectivity.</p>

<p>The enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; hydroxymethylbilane synthase; EC 2.5.1.61) catalyses an early step of the tetrapyrrole-biosynthesis pathway in which four molecules of the monopyrrole porphobilinogen are condensed to form a linear tetrapyrrole. The enzyme possesses a dipyrromethane cofactor, which is covalently linked by a thioether bridge to an invariant cysteine residue (Cys241 in the Bacillus megaterium enzyme). The cofactor is extended during the reaction by the sequential addition of the four substrate molecules, which are released as a linear tetrapyrrole product. Expression in Escherichia coli of a His-tagged form of B. megaterium PBGD has permitted the X-ray analysis of the enzyme from this species at high resolution, showing that the cofactor becomes progressively oxidized to the dipyrromethene and dipyrromethanone forms. In previously solved PBGD structures, the oxidized cofactor is in the dipyromethenone form, in which both pyrrole rings are approximately coplanar. In contrast, the oxidized cofactor in the B. megaterium enzyme appears to be in the dipyrromethanone form, in which the C atom at the bridging α-position of the outer pyrrole ring is very clearly in a tetrahedral configuration. It is suggested that the pink colour of the freshly purified protein is owing to the presence of the dipyrromethene form of the cofactor which, in the structure reported here, adopts the same conformation as the fully reduced dipyrromethane form. </p>

<p>Dethiobiotin synthetase (DTBS) is involved in the biosynthesis of biotin in bacteria, fungi, and plants. As humans lack this pathway, DTBS is a promising antimicrobial drug target. We determined structures of DTBS from Helicobacter pylori (hpDTBS) bound with cofactors and a substrate analog, and described its unique characteristics relative to other DTBS proteins. Comparison with bacterial DTBS orthologs revealed considerable structural differences in nucleotide recognition. The C-terminal region of DTBS proteins, which contains two nucleotide-recognition motifs, differs greatly among DTBS proteins from different species. The structure of hpDTBS revealed that this protein is unique and does not contain a C-terminal region containing one of the motifs. The single nucleotide-binding motif in hpDTBS is similar to its counterpart in GTPases; however, isothermal titration calorimetry binding studies showed that hpDTBS has a strong preference for ATP. The structural determinants of ATP specificity were assessed with X-ray crystallographic studies of hpDTBS·ATP and hpDTBS·GTP complexes. The unique mode of nucleotide recognition in hpDTBS makes this protein a good target for H. pylori-specific inhibitors of the biotin synthesis pathway.</p>

<p>Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) into d-glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate (1,3-diPG) in the presence of NAD(+) and inorganic phosphate (P(i)). Within the active site, two anion-binding sites were ascribed to the binding of the C3 phosphate of GAP (P(s)) and to the binding of the attacking phosphate ion (P(i)). The role played by these two sites in the catalytic mechanism in connection with the functional role of coenzyme exchange (NADH-NAD(+) shuttle) has been investigated by several studies leading to the C3 phosphate flipping model proposed by Skarzynski et al. [Skarzynski, T., Moody, P. C., and Wonacott, A. J. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 193, 171-187]. This model has not yet received direct confirmation. To gain further insight into the role of both sites, we synthesized irreversible inhibitors which form with the essential cysteine residue a thioacyl enzyme analogue of the catalytic intermediate. Here we report the refined glycosomal Trypanosoma cruzi GAPDH in complex with a covalently bound GAP analogue at an improved resolution of 2.0-2.5 A. For this holo-thioacyl enzyme complex, a flip-flop movement is clearly characterized, the change from the P(i) to the P(s) binding site being correlated with the coenzyme exchange step: the weaker interaction of the intermediate when bound at the P(s) site with the cofactor allows its release and also the binding of the inorganic phosphate for the next catalytic step. This result gives strong experimental support for the generally accepted flip-flop model of the catalytic mechanism in GAPDH.</p>

<p>A 5-aryl-1H-pyrazole molecular scaffold was designed to ligate the ATP binding site of cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) on the basis of crystallographic information. A search of the compound collection of Novartis using this scaffold as substructure query led to the identification of PKF049-365 as a representative of a new class of inhibitors of the cell cycle kinases CDK1/2. The three-dimensional structure of CDK2 in complex with PKF049-365 was subsequently determined by protein crystallography and refined to 1.53 A resolution. The X-ray analysis confirmed the binding mode expected from the design hypothesis. In addition, it revealed an alternative binding orientation involving a second tautomeric form of the inhibitor that was not envisaged during the design stage.</p>

<p>The structural and functional role of conserved residue G86 in HIV-1 protease (PR) was investigated by NMR and crystallographic analyses of substitution mutations of glycine to alanine and serine (PR(G86A) and PR(G86S)). While PR(G86S) had undetectable catalytic activity, PR(G86A) exhibited approximately 6000-fold lower catalytic activity than PR. (1)H-(15)N NMR correlation spectra revealed that PR(G86A) and PR(G86S) are dimeric, exhibiting dimer dissociation constants (K(d)) of approximately 0.5 and approximately 3.2 muM, respectively, which are significantly lower than that seen for PR with R87K mutation (K(d) &gt; 1 mM). Thus, the G86 mutants, despite being partially dimeric under the assay conditions, are defective in catalyzing substrate hydrolysis. NMR spectra revealed no changes in the chemical shifts even in the presence of excess substrate, indicating very poor binding of the substrate. Both NMR chemical shift data and crystal structures of PR(G86A) and PR(G86S) in the presence of active-site inhibitors indicated high structural similarity to previously described PR/inhibitor complexes, except for specific perturbations within the active site loop and around the mutation site. The crystal structures in the presence of the inhibitor showed that the region around residue 86 was connected to the active site by a conserved network of hydrogen bonds, and the two regions moved further apart in the mutants. Overall, in contrast to the role of R87 in contributing significantly to the dimer stability of PR, G86 is likely to play an important role in maintaining the correct geometry of the active site loop in the PR dimer for substrate binding and hydrolysis.

<p>Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), used in many types of consumer goods, are being studied because of concerns about possible health effects related to endocrine disruption, immunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and neurotoxicity. Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), the most widely used BFR, and human metabolites of certain congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ether (e.g., 3-OH-BDE-47) have been suggested to inhibit estrogen sulfotransferase, potentially affecting estrogen metabolism.</p>

<p>Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), the primary cAMP-hydrolyzing enzyme in cells, is a promising drug target for a wide range of conditions. Here we present seven co-crystal structures of PDE4 and bound inhibitors that show the regulatory domain closed across the active site, thereby revealing the structural basis of PDE4 regulation. This structural insight, together with supporting mutagenesis and kinetic studies, allowed us to design small-molecule allosteric modulators of PDE4D that do not completely inhibit enzymatic activity (I(max) approximately 80-90%). These allosteric modulators have reduced potential to cause emesis, a dose-limiting side effect of existing active site-directed PDE4 inhibitors, while maintaining biological activity in cellular and in vivo models. Our results may facilitate the design of CNS therapeutics modulating cAMP signaling for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia and depression, where brain distribution is desired for therapeutic benefit.</p>

<p>We have used chemical protein synthesis and advanced physical methods to probe dynamics-function correlations for the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme that has received considerable attention as a target for the treatment of AIDS. Chemical synthesis was used to prepare a series of unique analogues of the HIV-1 protease in which the flexibility of the "flap" structures (residues 37-61 in each monomer of the homodimeric protein molecule) was systematically varied. These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations. We show that conformational isomerization in the flaps is correlated with structural reorganization of residues in the active site, and that it is preorganization of the active site that is a rate-limiting factor in catalysis.</p>

<p>Granzyme B, one of the most abundant granzymes in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) granules, and members of the caspase (cysteine aspartyl proteinases) family have a unique cleavage specificity for aspartic acid in P1 and play critical roles in the biochemical events that culminate in cell death.</p>

<p>This paper focuses on the radiation-damage effects when applying the same total X-ray dose to protein crystals at different dose rates. These experiments have been performed on both a selenomethionated protein and on bovine trypsin using dose rates that span nearly two orders of magnitude. The results show no clear dose-rate effect on the global indicators of radiation damage, but a small measurable dose-rate effect could be found when studying specific radiation damage. It is hypothesized that this observed dose-rate effect relates to differences in the steady-state free-radical concentration.</p>

<p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SPL), a key enzyme of sphingolipid metabolism, catalyzes the irreversible degradation of sphingoid base phosphates. Its main substrate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) acts both extracellularly, by binding G protein-coupled receptors of the lysophospholipid receptor family, and inside the cell, as a second messenger. There, S1P takes part in regulating various cellular processes and its levels are tightly regulated. SPL is a pivotal enzyme regulating S1P intracellular concentrations and a promising drug target for the design of immunosuppressants. We structurally and functionally characterized yeast SPL (Dpl1p) and its first prokaryotic homolog, from Symbiobacterium thermophilum. The Dpl1p structure served as a basis for a very reliable model of Homo sapiens SPL. The above results, together with in vitro and in vivo studies of SPL mutants, reveal which residues are involved in activity and substrate binding and pave the way to studies aimed at controlling the activity of this pivotal enzyme.</p>

<p>The crystal structures, dimer stabilities, and kinetics have been analyzed for wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and resistant mutants PR(L24I), PR(I50V), and PR(G73S) to gain insight into the molecular basis of drug resistance. The mutations lie in different structural regions. Mutation I50V alters a residue in the flexible flap that interacts with the inhibitor, L24I alters a residue adjacent to the catalytic Asp25, and G73S lies at the protein surface far from the inhibitor-binding site. PR(L24I) and PR(I50V), showed a 4% and 18% lower k(cat)/K(m), respectively, relative to PR. The relative k(cat)/K(m) of PR(G73S) varied from 14% to 400% when assayed using different substrates. Inhibition constants (K(i)) of the antiviral drug indinavir for the reaction catalyzed by the mutant enzymes were about threefold and 50-fold higher for PR(L24I) and PR(I50V), respectively, relative to PR and PR(G73S). The dimer dissociation constant (K(d)) was estimated to be approximately 20 nM for both PR(L24I) and PR(I50V), and below 5 nM for PR(G73S) and PR. Crystal structures of the mutants PR(L24I), PR(I50V) and PR(G73S) were determined in complexes with indinavir, or the p2/NC substrate analog at resolutions of 1.10-1.50 Angstrom. Each mutant revealed distinct structural changes relative to PR. The mutated residues in PR(L24I) and PR(I50V) had reduced intersubunit contacts, consistent with the increased K(d) for dimer dissociation. Relative to PR, PR(I50V) had fewer interactions of Val50 with inhibitors, in agreement with the dramatically increased K(i). The distal mutation G73S introduced new hydrogen bond interactions that can transmit changes to the substrate-binding site and alter catalytic activity. Therefore, the structural alterations observed for drug-resistant mutations were in agreement with kinetic and stability changes.</p>

<p>Cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) are typically major components of natural enzyme cocktails for biomass degradation. Their active sites are enclosed in a tunnel, enabling processive hydrolysis of cellulose chains. Glycoside hydrolase Family 6 (GH6) CBHs act from nonreducing ends by an inverting mechanism and are present in many cellulolytic fungi and bacteria. The bacterial Thermobifida fusca Cel6B (TfuCel6B) exhibits a longer and more enclosed active site tunnel than its fungal counterparts. Here, we determine the structures of two TfuCel6B mutants co-crystallized with cellobiose, D274A (catalytic acid), and the double mutant D226A/S232A, which targets the putative catalytic base and a conserved serine that binds the nucleophilic water. The ligand binding and the structure of the active site are retained when compared with the wild type structure, supporting the hypothesis that these residues are directly involved in catalysis. One structure exhibits crystallographic waters that enable construction of a model of the α-anomer product after hydrolysis. Interestingly, the product sites of TfuCel6B are completely enclosed by an "exit loop" not present in fungal GH6 CBHs and by an extended "bottom loop". From the structures, we hypothesize that either of the loops enclosing the product subsites in the TfuCel6B active site tunnel must open substantially for product release. With simulation, we demonstrate that both loops can readily open to allow product release with equal probability in solution or when the enzyme is engaged on cellulose. Overall, this study reveals new structural details of GH6 CBHs likely important for functional differences among enzymes from this important family. </p>

<p>The crystal structures of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylases (PurNs) from Aquifex aeolicus (Aa), Geobacillus kaustophilus (Gk) and Symbiobacterium toebii (St), and of formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase (PurU) from Thermus thermophilus (Tt) were determined. The monomer structures of the determined PurN and PurU were very similar to the known structure of PurN, but oligomeric states were different; AaPurN and StPurN formed dimers, GkPurN formed monomer and PurU formed tetramer in the crystals. PurU had a regulatory ACT domain in its N-terminal side. So far several structures of PurUs have been determined, yet, the mechanisms of the catalysis and the regulation of PurU have not been elucidated. We, therefore, modelled ligand-bound structures of PurN and PurU, and performed molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the reaction mechanisms. The evolutionary relationship of the two enzymes is discussed based on the comparisons of the structures and the catalytic mechanisms. </p>

<p>The crystal structures of the copper enzyme phenylethylamine oxidase from the Gram-positive bacterium Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO) have been determined and refined for three forms of the enzyme: the holoenzyme in its active form (at 2.2 A resolution), the holoenzyme in an inactive form (at 2.8 A resolution), and the apoenzyme (at 2.2 A resolution). The holoenzyme has a topaquinone (TPQ) cofactor formed from the apoenzyme by the post-translational modification of a tyrosine residue in the presence of Cu2+. Significant differences between the three forms of AGAO are limited to the active site. The polypeptide fold is closely similar to those of the amine oxidases from Escherichia coli [Parsons, M. R., et al. (1995) Structure 3, 1171-1184] and pea seedlings [Kumar, V., et al. (1996) Structure 4, 943-955]. In the active form of holo-AGAO, the active-site Cu atom is coordinated by three His residues and two water molecules in an approximately square-pyramidal arrangement. In the inactive form, the Cu atom is coordinated by the same three His residues and by the phenolic oxygen of the TPQ, the geometry being quasi-trigonal-pyramidal. There is evidence of disorder in the crystals of both forms of holo-AGAO. As a result, only the position of the aromatic group of the TPQ cofactor, but not its orientation about the Cbeta-Cgamma bond, is determined unequivocally. In apo-AGAO, electron density consistent with an unmodified Tyr occurs at a position close to that of the TPQ in the inactive holo-AGAO. This observation has implications for the biogenesis of TPQ. Two features which have not been described previously in amine oxidase structures are a channel from the molecular surface to the active site and a solvent-filled cavity at the major interface between the two subunits of the dimer.</p>

<p>Novel triazoloquinazolines have been found as phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors. Structure-activity studies improved the initial micromolar potency which was found in the lead compound by a 100-fold identifying 5-(1H-benzoimidazol-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-2-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline, 42 (PDE10A IC(50)=12 nM) as the most potent compound from the series. Two X-ray structures revealed novel binding modes to the catalytic site of the PDE10A enzyme.</p>

<p>The crystal structures of complexes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pantothenate kinase with the following ligands have been determined: (i) citrate; (ii) the nonhydrolysable ATP analogue AMPPCP and pantothenate (the initiation complex); (iii) ADP and phosphopantothenate resulting from phosphorylation of pantothenate by ATP in the crystal (the end complex); (iv) ATP and ADP, each with half occupancy, resulting from a quick soak of crystals in ATP (the intermediate complex); (v) CoA; (vi) ADP prepared by soaking and cocrystallization, which turned out to have identical structures, and (vii) ADP and pantothenate. Solution studies on CoA binding and catalytic activity have also been carried out. Unlike in the case of the homologous Escherichia coli enzyme, AMPPCP and ADP occupy different, though overlapping, locations in the respective complexes; the same is true of pantothenate in the initiation complex and phosphopantothenate in the end complex. The binding site of MtPanK is substantially preformed, while that of EcPanK exhibits considerable plasticity. The difference in the behaviour of the E. coli and M. tuberculosis enzymes could be explained in terms of changes in local structure resulting from substitutions. It is unusual for two homologous enzymes to exhibit such striking differences in action. Therefore, the results have to be treated with caution. However, the changes in the locations of ligands exhibited by M. tuberculosis pantothenate kinase are remarkable and novel.</p>

<p>Peptidomimetic inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease are successful lead substances for the development of virostatic drugs against HIV as the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The hydroxyethylamine isostere of the proteolytic cleavage intermediate provides a suitable replacement for the peptide bond. A series of acyclic pseudopeptide inhibitors with the hydroxyethylamine isostere varying in chiral carbon configuration and P'2 residue type were structurally analysed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The compounds inhibit HIV protease with subnanomolar inhibition constants and block viral replication in tissue cultures. Here, the structure of such a complex with the R configuration of the isosteric group (PDB code 1zsf) is presented together with newly available synchrotron data for a complex with the S stereoisomer of the inhibitor (PDB code 1zsr). Comparison of the structure and binding with other complexes of HIV-1 protease and similar inhibitors contributes to the understanding of how these molecules bind to the wild-type form of this enzyme. The hydroxy group of the R stereoisomer interacts with one of the catalytic aspartic acids by a short hydrogen bond with rather extreme geometry. The change of configuration of the chiral carbon bearing the hydroxyl from S to R does not influence the inhibition efficiency in this case.</p>

<p>Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (vitamin B(6) ) is an essential cofactor for many important enzymatic reactions such as transamination and decarboxylation. African trypanosomes are unable to synthesise vitamin B(6) de novo and rely on uptake of B(6) vitamers such as pyridoxal and pyridoxamine from their hosts, which are subsequently phosphorylated by pyridoxal kinase (PdxK). A conditional null mutant of PdxK was generated in Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms showing that this enzyme is essential for growth of the parasite in vitro and for infectivity in mice. Activity of recombinant T. brucei PdxK was comparable to previously published work having a specific activity of 327 ± 13 mU mg(-1) and a K(m)(app) with respect to pyridoxal of 29.6 ± 3.9 µM. A coupled assay was developed demonstrating that the enzyme has equivalent catalytic efficiency with pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, and that ginkgotoxin is an effective pseudo substrate. A high resolution structure of PdxK in complex with ATP revealed important structural differences with the human enzyme. These findings suggest that pyridoxal kinase is an essential and druggable target that could lead to much needed alternative treatments for this devastating disease.</p>

<p>A fragment-based screen against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) integrase led to a number of compounds that bound to the lens epithelium derived growth factor (LEDGF) binding site of the integrase catalytic core domain. We determined the crystallographic structures of complexes of the HIV integrase catalytic core domain for 10 of these compounds and quantitated the binding by surface plasmon resonance. We demonstrate that the compounds inhibit the interaction of LEDGF with HIV integrase in a proximity AlphaScreen assay, an assay for the LEDGF enhancement of HIV integrase strand transfer and in a cell based assay. The compounds identified represent a potential framework for the development of a new series of HIV integrase inhibitors that do not bind to the catalytic site of the enzyme.</p>

<p>The peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1 is a promising molecular target for anti-cancer therapeutics. Here we report the structure-guided evolution of an indole 2-carboxylic acid fragment hit into a series of alpha-benzimidazolyl-substituted amino acids. Examples inhibited Pin1 activity with IC(50) &lt;100nM, but were inactive on cells. Replacement of the benzimidazole ring with a naphthyl group resulted in a 10-50-fold loss in ligand potency, but these examples downregulated biomarkers of Pin1 activity and blocked proliferation of PC3 cells.</p>

<p>The redox active peptide glutathione is ubiquitous in nature, but some plants also synthesize glutathione analogs in response to environmental stresses. To understand the evolution of chemical diversity in the closely related enzymes homoglutathione synthetase (hGS) and glutathione synthetase (GS), we determined the structures of soybean (Glycine max) hGS in three states: apoenzyme, bound to gamma-glutamylcysteine (gammaEC), and with hGSH, ADP, and a sulfate ion bound in the active site. Domain movements and rearrangement of active site loops change the structure from an open active site form (apoenzyme and gammaEC complex) to a closed active site form (hGSH*ADP*SO(4)(2-) complex). The structure of hGS shows that two amino acid differences in an active site loop provide extra space to accommodate the longer beta-Ala moiety of hGSH in comparison to the glycinyl group of glutathione. Mutation of either Leu-487 or Pro-488 to an Ala improves catalytic efficiency using Gly, but a double mutation (L487A/P488A) is required to convert the substrate preference of hGS from beta-Ala to Gly. These structures, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, reveal the molecular changes that define the substrate preference of hGS, explain the product diversity within evolutionarily related GS-like enzymes, and reinforce the critical role of active site loops in the adaptation and diversification of enzyme function.</p>

<p>The histidine biosynthetic pathway is an ancient one found in bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi, and plants that converts 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate to l-histidine in 10 enzymatic reactions. This pathway provided a paradigm for the operon, transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and feedback inhibition of a pathway. l-histidinol dehydrogenase (HisD, EC ) catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of l-histidine: sequential NAD-dependent oxidations of l-histidinol to l-histidinaldehyde and then to l-histidine. HisD functions as a homodimer and requires the presence of one Zn(2+) cation per monomer. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli HisD in the apo state as well as complexes with substrate, Zn(2+), and NAD(+) (best resolution is 1.7 A). Each monomer is made of four domains, whereas the intertwined dimer possibly results from domain swapping. Two domains display a very similar incomplete Rossmann fold that suggests an ancient event of gene duplication. Residues from both monomers form the active site. Zn(2+) plays a crucial role in substrate binding but is not directly involved in catalysis. The active site residue His-327 participates in acid-base catalysis, whereas Glu-326 activates a water molecule. NAD(+) binds weakly to one of the Rossmann fold domains in a manner different from that previously observed for other proteins having a Rossmann fold.</p>

<p>Gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane envelope consisting of an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, which protect the pathogen from antimicrobial peptides and have multifaceted roles in virulence. Lipopolysaccharide consists of a glycan moiety attached to lipid A, embedded in the outer membrane. Modification of the lipid A headgroups by phosphoethanolamine (PEA) or 4-amino-arabinose residues increases resistance to the cationic cyclic polypeptide antibiotic, polymyxin. Lipid A PEA transferases are members of the YhjW/YjdB/YijP superfamily and usually consist of a transmembrane domain anchoring the enzyme to the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane attached to a soluble catalytic domain. The crystal structure of the soluble domain of the protein of the lipid A PEA transferase from Neisseria meningitidis has been determined crystallographically and refined to 1.4Å resolution. The structure reveals a core hydrolase fold similar to that of alkaline phosphatase. Loop regions in the structure differ, presumably to enable interaction with the membrane-localized substrates and to provide substrate specificity. A phosphorylated form of the putative nucleophile, Thr280, is observed. Metal ions present in the active site are coordinated to Thr280 and to residues conserved among the family of transferases. The structure reveals the protein components needed for the transferase chemistry; however, substrate-binding regions are not evident and are likely to reside in the transmembrane domain of the protein. </p>

<p>The redox active peptide glutathione is ubiquitous in nature, but some plants also synthesize glutathione analogs in response to environmental stresses. To understand the evolution of chemical diversity in the closely related enzymes homoglutathione synthetase (hGS) and glutathione synthetase (GS), we determined the structures of soybean (Glycine max) hGS in three states: apoenzyme, bound to gamma-glutamylcysteine (gammaEC), and with hGSH, ADP, and a sulfate ion bound in the active site. Domain movements and rearrangement of active site loops change the structure from an open active site form (apoenzyme and gammaEC complex) to a closed active site form (hGSH*ADP*SO(4)(2-) complex). The structure of hGS shows that two amino acid differences in an active site loop provide extra space to accommodate the longer beta-Ala moiety of hGSH in comparison to the glycinyl group of glutathione. Mutation of either Leu-487 or Pro-488 to an Ala improves catalytic efficiency using Gly, but a double mutation (L487A/P488A) is required to convert the substrate preference of hGS from beta-Ala to Gly. These structures, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, reveal the molecular changes that define the substrate preference of hGS, explain the product diversity within evolutionarily related GS-like enzymes, and reinforce the critical role of active site loops in the adaptation and diversification of enzyme function.</p>

<p>The E. coli isozyme of gamma-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-AT) is a tetrameric pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes transamination between primary amines and alpha-keto acids. The roles of the active site residues V241, E211, and I50 in the GABA-AT mechanism have been probed by site-directed mutagenesis. The beta-branched side chain of V241 facilitates formation of external aldimine intermediates with primary amine substrates, while E211 provides charge compensation of R398 selectively in the primary amine half-reaction and I50 forms a hydrophobic lid at the top of the substrate binding site. The structures of the I50Q, V241A, and E211S mutants were solved by X-ray crystallography to resolutions of 2.1, 2.5, and 2.52 A, respectively. The structure of GABA-AT is similar in overall fold and active site structure to that of dialkylglycine decarboxylase, which catalyzes both transamination and decarboxylation half-reactions in its normal catalytic cycle. Therefore, an attempt was made to convert GABA-AT into a decarboxylation-dependent aminotransferase similar to dialkylglycine decarboxylase by systematic mutation of E. coli GABA-AT active site residues. Two of the twelve mutants presented, E211S/I50G/C77K and E211S/I50H/V80D, have approximately 10-fold higher decarboxylation activities than the wild-type enzyme, and the E211S/I50H/V80D has formally changed the reaction specificity to that of a decarboxylase.</p>

<p>We have determined the crystal structure, at 1.4A, of the Nudix hydrolase DR1025 from the extremely radiation resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. The protein forms an intertwined homodimer by exchanging N-terminal segments between chains. We have identified additional conserved elements of the Nudix fold, including the metal-binding motif, a kinked beta-strand characterized by a proline two positions upstream of the Nudix consensus sequence, and participation of the N-terminal extension in the formation of the substrate-binding pocket. Crystal structures were also solved of DR1025 crystallized in the presence of magnesium and either a GTP analog or Ap(4)A (both at 1.6A resolution). In the Ap(4)A co-crystal, the electron density indicated that the product of asymmetric hydrolysis, ATP, was bound to the enzyme. The GTP analog bound structure showed that GTP was bound almost identically as ATP. Neither nucleoside triphosphate was further cleaved.</p>

<p>Tankyrases are ADP-ribosyltransferases that play key roles in various cellular pathways, including the regulation of cell proliferation, and thus, they are promising drug targets for the treatment of cancer. Flavones have been shown to inhibit tankyrases and we report here the discovery of more potent and selective flavone derivatives. Commercially available flavones with single substitutions were used for structure-activity relationship studies, and cocrystal structures of the 18 hit compounds were analyzed to explain their potency and selectivity. The most potent inhibitors were also tested in a cell-based assay, which demonstrated that they effectively antagonize Wnt signaling. To assess selectivity, they were further tested against a panel of homologous human ADP-ribosyltransferases. The most effective compound, 22 (MN-64), showed 6 nM potency against tankyrase 1, isoenzyme selectivity, and Wnt signaling inhibition. This work forms a basis for rational development of flavones as tankyrase inhibitors and guides the development of other structurally related inhibitors. </p>

<p>Linus Pauling established the conceptual framework for understanding and mimicking enzymes more than six decades ago. The notion that enzymes selectively stabilize the rate-limiting transition state of the catalysed reaction relative to the bound ground state reduces the problem of design to one of molecular recognition. Nevertheless, past attempts to capitalize on this idea, for example by using transition state analogues to elicit antibodies with catalytic activities, have generally failed to deliver true enzymatic rates. The advent of computational design approaches, combined with directed evolution, has provided an opportunity to revisit this problem. Starting from a computationally designed catalyst for the Kemp elimination--a well-studied model system for proton transfer from carbon--we show that an artificial enzyme can be evolved that accelerates an elementary chemical reaction 6 × 10(8)-fold, approaching the exceptional efficiency of highly optimized natural enzymes such as triosephosphate isomerase. A 1.09 Å resolution crystal structure of the evolved enzyme indicates that familiar catalytic strategies such as shape complementarity and precisely placed catalytic groups can be successfully harnessed to afford such high rate accelerations, making us optimistic about the prospects of designing more sophisticated catalysts.</p>

<p>Class D β-lactamases that hydrolyze carbapenems such as imipenem and doripenem are a recognized danger to the efficacy of these "last-resort" β-lactam antibiotics. Like all known class D carbapenemases, OXA-23 cannot hydrolyze the expanded-spectrum cephalosporin ceftazidime. OXA-146 is an OXA-23 subfamily clinical variant that differs from the parent enzyme by a single alanine (A220) inserted in the loop connecting β-strands β5 and β6. We discovered that this insertion enables OXA-146 to bind and hydrolyze ceftazidime with an efficiency comparable to those of other extended-spectrum class D β-lactamases. OXA-146 also binds and hydrolyzes aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin with higher efficiency than OXA-23 and preserves activity against doripenem. In this study, we report the X-ray crystal structures of both the OXA-23 and OXA-146 enzymes at 1.6-Å and 1.2-Å resolution. A comparison of the two structures shows that the extra alanine moves a methionine (M221) out of its normal position, where it forms a bridge over the top of the active site. This single amino acid insertion also lengthens the β5-β6 loop, moving the entire backbone of this region further away from the active site. A model of ceftazidime bound in the active site reveals that these two structural alterations are both likely to relieve steric clashes between the bulky R1 side chain of ceftazidime and OXA-23. With activity against all four classes of β-lactam antibiotics, OXA-146 represents an alarming new threat to the treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter spp. </p>

<p>The beta-lactamases are involved in bacterial resistance to penicillin and related compounds. Members of the metallo-enzyme class are now found in many pathogenic bacteria and are thus becoming of major clinical importance. The structures of the Zn-beta-lactamase from Fluoribacter gormanii (FEZ-1) in the native and in the complex form are reported here. FEZ-1 is a monomeric enzyme, which possesses two zinc-binding sites. These structures are discussed in comparison with those of the tetrameric L1 enzyme produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. From this analysis, amino acids involved in the oligomerization of L1 are clearly identified. Despite the similarity in fold, the active site of FEZ-1 was found to be significantly different. Two residues, which were previously implicated in function, are not present in L1 or in FEZ-1. The broad-spectrum substrate profile of Zn-beta-lactamases arises from the rather wide active-site cleft, where various beta-lactam compounds can be accommodated.</p>

<p>Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is a family of enzymes that utilizes ATP and methionine to produce S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the most crucial methyl donor in the biological methylation of biomolecules and bioactive natural products. Here, we report that the MAT from Sulfolobus solfataricus (sMAT), an enzyme from a poorly explored class of the MAT family, has the ability to produce a range of differentially alkylated AdoMet analogs in the presence of non-native methionine analogs and ATP. To investigate the molecular basis for AdoMet analog production, we have crystallized the sMAT in the AdoMet bound, S-adenosylethionine (AdoEth) bound and unbound forms. Notably, among these structures, the AdoEth bound form offers the first MAT structure containing a non-native product, and cumulatively these structures add new structural insight into the MAT family and allow for detailed active site comparison with its homologs in Escherichia coli and human. As a thermostable MAT structure from archaea, the structures herein also provide a basis for future engineering to potentially broaden AdoMet analog production as reagents for methyltransferase-catalyzed 'alkylrandomization' and/or the study of methylation in the context of biological processes.</p>

<p>Here we report the X-ray structures of chemically synthesized HIV-1 protease and the inactive [D25N]HIV-1 protease complexed with the ketomethylene isostere inhibitor Ac-Thr-Ile-Nle psi[CO-CH(2)]Nle-Gln-Arg.amide at 1.4 and 1.8A resolution, respectively. In complex with the active enzyme, the keto-group was found to be converted into the hydrated gem-diol, while the structure of the complex with the inactive D25N enzyme revealed an intact keto-group. These data support the general acid-general base mechanism for HIV-1 protease catalysis.</p>

<p>The crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase has been solved with bound effector, l-serine, and substrate, hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate, at resolutions of 2.7 and 2.4 A, respectively. The subunits display the same extreme asymmetry as seen in the apo-structure and provide insight into the mode of serine binding and closure of the active site. Mutagenesis studies confirm the identity of the main residues involved in serine binding and suggest that the poly glycine stretch in the loop that contains the locus for the 160 degrees rotation that leads to subunit asymmetry may have a larger role in folding than in catalysis. The lack of electron density for the cofactor, NADH, in any of the crystals examined led us to study binding by stopped flow kinetic analysis. The kinetic data suggest that productive NADH binding, that would support catalytic turnover, is dependent on the presence of substrate. This observation, along with the binding of substrate in the active site, but in an unproductive conformation, suggests a possible mechanism where initial binding of substrate leads to enhanced interaction with cofactor accompanied by a rearrangement of catalytically critical residue side chains. Furthermore, comparison to the structure of a truncated form of human d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase with cofactor and a substrate analog, provides insight into the conformational changes that occur during catalysis.</p>

<p>We performed X-ray crystallographic analyses of 6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase (Hyb-24DN), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of nylon-6, an industry by-product, and of a complex between Hyb-24DN-A(112) (S112A-mutant of Hyb-24DN) and 6-aminohexanoate-linear dimer (Ald) at 1.58 A and 1.4 A resolution, respectively. In Hyb-24DN, Asp181-O(delta) forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr170-O(eta), -two of the catalytic and binding amino acids, and a loop between Asn167 and Val177. This state is the so-called open form, allowing its substrate to bind in the space between the loop and catalytic residues. Upon substrate binding (in Hyb-24DN-A(112)/Ald complex), the loop is shifted 4.3 A at Tyr170-C(alpha), and the side-chain of Tyr170 is rotated. By the combined effect, Tyr170-O(eta) moves a total of 10.5 A, resulting in the formation of hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen of amide linkage in Ald (closed form). In addition, electrostatic interaction between Asp181-O(delta) and the amino group in Ald stabilizes the substrate binding. We propose here that the enzyme catalysis proceeds according to the following steps: (i) Ald-induced transition from open to closed form, (ii) nucleophilic attack of Ser112 to Ald and formation of a tetrahedral intermediate, (iii) formation of acyl enzyme and transition to open form, (iv) deacylation. Amino acid substitutions reducing the enzyme/Ald interaction at positions 181 or 170 drastically decreased the Ald-hydrolytic activity, but had very little effect on esterolytic activity, suggesting that esterolytic reaction proceeds regardless of conversion. Present models illustrate why new activity against the nylon oligomer has evolved in an esterase with beta-lactamase folds, while retaining the original esterolytic functions.</p>

<p>The HIV-1 protease (PR) mediates its own release (autoprocessing) from the polyprotein precursor, Gag-Pol, flanked by the transframe region (TFR) and reverse transcriptase at its N- and C-termini, respectively. Autoprocessing at the N-terminus of PR mediates stable dimer formation essential for catalytic activity, leading to the formation of infectious virus. An antiparallel β-sheet interface formed by the four N- and C-terminal residues of each subunit is important for dimer stability. Here, we present the first high-resolution crystal structures of model protease precursor-clinical inhibitor (PI darunavir or saquinavir) complexes, revealing varying conformations of the N-terminal flanking (S(-4)FNF(-1)) and interface residues (P(1)QIT(4)). A 180° rotation of the T(4)-L(5) peptide bond is accompanied by a new Q(2)-L(5) hydrogen bond and complete disengagement of PQIT from the β-sheet dimer interface, which may be a feature for intramolecular autoprocessing. This result is consistent with drastically lower thermal stability by 14-20 °C of PI complexes of precursors and the mature PR lacking its PQIT residues (by 18.3 °C). Similar to the TFR-PR precursor, this deletion also results in a darunavir dissociation constant (2 × 10(4))-fold higher and a markedly increased dimer dissociation constant relative to the mature PR. The terminal β-sheet perturbations of the dimeric structure likely account for the drastically poorer inhibition of autoprocessing of TFR-PR relative to the mature PR, even though significant differences in active site-PI interactions in these structures were not observed. The novel conformations of the dimer interface may be exploited to target selectively the protease precursor prior to its N-terminal cleavage.</p>
